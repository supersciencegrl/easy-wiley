         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine tuning color through optical band structure and interfaces: Through anaerobic pyrolysis, generation of rare earth oxide&#8208;reduced carbon interfaces allows for tunability and convergence in color from optical band structure to structural evolution. Herein, we show Ho3+ ions which start pink in nature and undergo transitions in luminosity and chromaticity to black, illustrating the role of structure, composition, and processing conditions.







Abstract
Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized and in situ self&#8208;assembled to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity, and chromaticity were investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transition states relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor band gap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.

         <title>Revealing Na+&#8208;coordination induced Failure Mechanism of Metal Sulfide Anode for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination with Na+ in electrolyte induces excessive dissolution and electric field driven delocalization of Na2S, causing solo oxidations of discharge products, which is revealed as the cycling failure mechanism for MS anode. Therefore, the coordination regulation of Na2S is proposed as an effective strategy.







Abstract
Metal sulfide (MS) is regarded as a promising candidate of the anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) with ideal capacity and low cost, yet still suffers from the inferior cycling stability and voltage degradation. Herein, the coordination relationship between the discharge product Na2S with the Na+ (NaPF6) in the electrolyte, is revealed as the root cause for the cycling failure of MS. Na+&#8208;coordination effect assistants the dissolution of Na2S, further delocalizing Na2S from the reaction interface under the function of electric field, which leads to the solo oxidation of the discharge product element metal without the participation of Na2S. Besides, the higher highest occupied molecular orbital of Na2S suggest the facilitated Na2S solo oxidation to produce sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Based on these, lowering the Na+ concentration of the electrolyte is proposed as a potential improvement strategy to change the coordination environment of Na2S, suppressing the side reactions of the solo&#8208;oxidation of element metal and Na2S. Consequently, the enhanced conversion reaction reversibility and prolonged cycle life are achieved. This work renders in&#8208;depth perception of failure mechanism and inspiration for realizing advanced conversion&#8208;type anode.

         <title>Genuine carbene versus carbene&#8208;like reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes which are sometime too elusive for direct detection, have been inferred through in&#8208;situ trapping experiments. Using the first spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), this study questions whether &#8220;carbene&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity is genuine evidence of carbene formation.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are not always isolable and often even elude direct detection. When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by in situ trapping experiments. However, is carbene&#8208;like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation? Herein, using the first example of a spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), we cast doubt on the most common carbene trapping reactions as sufficient proof of carbene formation.

         <title>Ideal Cage&#8208;like Pores for Molecular Sieving of Butane Isomers with High Purity and Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework with small windows and large cavities exhibit not only exclusive adsorption for iso&#8208;C4H10 but also record&#8208;high adsorption for n&#8208;C4H10. High&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) and n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) with record productivities can be obtained respectively from separation and desorption process.







Abstract
n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high&#8208;purity n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 in one&#8208;step separation process, developing iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion adsorbents with high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage&#8208;like MOF (SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller n&#8208;C4H10 enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of n&#8208;C4H10 simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA not only completely excludes iso&#8208;C4H10 in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity of 94.2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;kPa and 298&#8197;K, which is the highest value among iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion&#8208;type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has excellent n/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation performance and can achieve a record&#8208;high productivity of iso&#8208;C4H10 (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with high purity (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are synthesized with uniform chiral catalytic sites on the pore walls, exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance in enantioselective electrophilic amination reactions with good stability and recyclability.







Abstract
The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs) are prepared based on covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale production can be achieved at low cost, alongside excellent solution processibility, paving the way to diverse applications. Remarkably, the CPOFs exhibit exceptionally high NH3 uptake capacities, indicating their great potential toward NH3 capture.







Abstract
A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.

         <title>Building Co16&#8208;N3&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;MOF to Expand Design Parameters for MOF Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual small molecules auxiliary strategy was proposed to construct the first high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture, where the N3&#8722; supplies a new modification site to precisely bond strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction for cooperatively boosting photocatalysis.







Abstract
The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi&#8208;functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC with visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing capacity. Remarkably, the N3&#8722; molecule in hexadecameric cobalt azide SBU offers novel modification sites to precise bonding of strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction. The resulting Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC exhibits extremely high performance for oxidative coupling benzylamine (~100&#8201;% yield) via both energy and electron transfer processes, which is much superior to that of Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (31.5&#8201;%) and Carboxyl @Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (37.5&#8201;%). Systematic investigations reveal that the advantages of Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC in dual light&#8208;absorbing channels, robust bonding between Bodipy/Co16 clusters and efficient electron&#8208;hole separation can greatly boost photosynthesis. This work provides an ideal molecular platform for synergy between photosensitizing MOFs and chromophores by constructing high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based SBUs with surface&#8208;modifiable small molecules.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) was synthesized as an efficient acid OER catalyst. Grain boundaries effectively regulated the electronic structure of the active site and optimized the adsorption behavior of intermediates, but also stabilized the active site structure by preventing Ru dissolution and converting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).







Abstract
RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Inverse Hydride Shuttle Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient and stereoselective synthesis of alkaloid frameworks. We present a unique Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to enable the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.







Abstract
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Hetero&#8208;Phase Nanostructure Photocatalysts with Molecular&#8208;Scale Tunable Energy Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via an SBU regulating strategy, MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase (COK/MIL&#8208;125) was successfully prepared and employed in photocatalysis. This novel hetero&#8208;phase not only possesses periodic channel structures, but also exhibits the capacity of molecular&#8208;scale adjustment on energy levels.







Abstract
As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;Scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>A Fluorinated Chaperone Gives X&#8208;ray Crystal Structures of Acyclic Natural Product Derivatives up to 338 Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining X&#8208;ray crystal structures of compounds with long flexible chains that are liquids at room temperature is difficult. A new crystallization chaperone is reported that encapsulates such compounds and provides crystallographic images that cannot be obtained otherwise thus far.







Abstract
Crystallizing molecules with long flexible chains is a challenge, making it difficult to perform X&#8208;ray crystallography. Chaperones can assist in the crystallization of compounds that do not crystallize by themselves by producing solvate crystals that contain the analyte in their three&#8208;dimensional lattices. Among the most versatile chaperones for liquid analytes are tetraaryladamantanes (TAAs), but the size of the compounds that can be encapsulated is limited, and attempts to surpass this limit with known TAAs were unsuccessful. Here we report that 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)adamantane (TFM) is a crystallization chaperone for acyclic molecules up to the molecular weight of phytyl acetate (338&#8197;g/mol). Encapsulation of such a large acyclic compound was achieved when the analyte was esterified and when a two&#8208;step temperature protocol was used for crystallization. Exploratory work indicates that a drop to &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C allows for encapsulation of squalene (Mr 411&#8197;g/mol), albeit with positional disorder of the analyte. Our X&#8208;ray crystal structures of solvates with flexible analytes shed light on how crystalline order can be imposed on large acyclic analytes. The new, fluorinated TAA gives access to crystal structures that were inaccessible thus far.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Therapy, Photothermal Therapy, Cuproptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed bioorthogonal Cu single atom nanozyme (CuSACO) for specifically tumor&#8208;targeting and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided tumor multifunctional therapy including high&#8208;efficiency multienzyme catalytic activities (catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), peroxidase (POD)), photothermal therapy (PTT), cuproptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;based immunotherapy, which effectively curb the growth, metastasis and recurrence of tumors.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with atomically dispersed active sites are potential substitutes for natural enzymes. A systematic study of its multiple functions can in&#8208;depth understand SAzymes's nature, which remains elusive. Here, we develop a novel ultrafast synthesis of sputtered SAzymes by in situ bombarding&#8208;embedding technique. Using this method, sputtered copper (Cu) SAzymes (CuSA) is developed with unreported unique planar Cu&#8208;C3 coordinated configuration. To enhance the tumor&#8208;specific targeting, we employ a bioorthogonal approach to engineer CuSA, denoted as CuSACO. CuSACO not only exhibits minimal off&#8208;target toxicity but also possesses exceptional ultrahigh catalase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;like multienzyme activities, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation for effective tumor destruction. Surprisingly, CuSACO can release Cu ions in the presence of glutathione (GSH) to induce cuproptosis, enhancing the tumor treatment efficacy. Notably, CuSACO&#8242;s remarkable photothermal properties enables precise photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors. This, combined with nanozyme catalytic activities, cuproptosis and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of orthotopic breast tumors and gliomas, and lung metastasis. Our research highlights the potential of CuSACO as an innovative strategy to utilize multiple mechanism to enhance tumor therapeutic efficacy, broadening the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;like behavior and physiological mechanism of action of SAzymes.

         <title>Spontaneous &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Ketones by Gaseous CO2 at the Air&#8208;water Interface of Aqueous Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged aqueous microdroplets facilitate carboxylation at &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H position of ketones by gaseous CO2 at the air&#8211;water Interface.







Abstract
We present a catalyst&#8208;free route for the reduction of carbon dioxide integrated with the formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond at the air/water interface of negatively charged aqueous microdroplets, at ambient temperature. The reactions proceed through carbanion generation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of a ketone followed by nucleophilic addition to CO2. Online mass spectrometry reveals that the product is an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid. Several factors, such as the concentration of the reagents, pressure of CO2 gas, and distance traveled by the droplets, control the kinetics of the reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that water in the microdroplets facilitates this unusual chemistry. Furthermore, such a microdroplet strategy has been extended to seven different ketones. This work demonstrates a green pathway for the reduction of CO2 to useful carboxylated organic products.

         <title>Type I [4&#963;+4&#960;] versus [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] Cycloaddition To Access Medium&#8208;Sized Carbocycles and Discovery of a Liver X Receptor &#946;&#8208;Selective Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight-membered fused carbocycles through rhodium-catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;-donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3-diene-type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8-membered fused carbocycles through rhodium-catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;-donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&amp;gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol-metabolism-related fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery simultaneously integrates the power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. It can convert the chemical energy of H2O2 to electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. Benefiting from the ultrafast energy conversion rate, the battery exhibits extremely short self&#8208;charging time and realizes the continuous long&#8208;term energy supply.







Abstract
Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7&#8197;V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60&#8197;seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self&#8208;charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single&#8208;flow battery of 7.06&#8197;Ah to extend the long&#8208;term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self&#8208;charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self&#8208;charging power systems for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Bridging Atom Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Activation in a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. This variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation.







Abstract
Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites. Herein, we show an example that tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation. As a result, exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation performance was achieved with T25(Temperature for 25&#8201;% conversion)=35&#8201;&#176;C and T100 (Temperature for 100&#8201;% conversion)=150&#8201;&#176;C, which stands out from existing MOF&#8208;based catalysts and even rivals many noble metal catalysts. This work provides a guidance for the rational design of catalysts for efficient oxygen activation for an oxidation reaction.

         <title>Chemoselective Proteomics, Zinc Fingers, and a Zinc(II) Model for H2S Mediated Persulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persulfidation by H2S is a key modification of proteins. Using persulfide specific proteomics, cysteine rich zinc finger (ZF) proteins were found to be targets of persulfidation. The reaction of H2S with ZFs was evaluated using a series of ZFs and a small molecule ZnII coordination complex that mimics the ZF site. Persulfidation by H2S occurred in an O2 dependent manner, with the zinc acting as a conduit for electron transfer and S&#8722;S bond formation.







Abstract
The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be involved in the post&#8208;translational modification of cysteine residues to produce reactive persulfides. A persulfide&#8208;specific chemoselective proteomics approach with mammalian cells has identified a broad range of zinc finger (ZF) proteins as targets of persulfidation. Parallel studies with isolated ZFs show that persulfidation is mediated by ZnII, O2, and H2S, with intermediates involving oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based radicals detected by mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopies. A small molecule ZnII complex exhibits analogous reactivity with H2S and O2, giving a persulfidated product. These data show that ZnII is not just a biological structural element, but also plays a critical role in mediating H2S&#8208;dependent persulfidation. ZF persulfidation appears to be a general post&#8208;translational modification and a possible conduit for H2S signaling. This work has implications for our understanding of H2S&#8208;mediated signaling and the regulation of ZFs in cellular physiology and development.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8211;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8211;C over C&#8211;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Merged Molecular Switches Excel as Optoacoustic Dyes: Azobenzene&#8211;Cyanines Are Loud and Photostable NIR Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoacoustic (or photoacoustic) imaging promises micron&#8208;resolution noninvasive bioimaging with much deeper penetration (&gt;cm) than fluorescence. However, optoacoustic imaging of enzyme activity would require loud, photostable, NIR&#8208;absorbing molecular contrast agents: which remain unknown. Most organic molecular contrast agents are repurposed fluorophores, with severe shortcomings of photoinstability or phototoxicity under optoacoustic imaging, as consequences of their slow S1&#8594;S0 electronic relaxation. We now report that known fluorophores can be rationally modified to reach ultrafast S1&#8594;S0 rates, without much extra molecular complexity, simply by merging them with molecular switches. Here, we merge azobenzene switches to cyanine dyes to give ultrafast relaxation (&lt;10&#160;ps, &gt;100&#8208;fold faster). Without even adapting instrument settings, these azohemicyanines display outstanding improvements in signal longevity (&gt;1000&#8208;fold increase of photostability) and signal loudness (here: &gt;3&#8208;fold even at time zero). We show why this simple but unexplored design strategy can still offer stronger performance in the future, and can also increase the spatial resolution and the quantitative linearity of photoacoustic response over extended longitudinal imaging. By bringing the world of molecular switches and rotors to bear on problems facing optoacoustic agents, this practical strategy will help to unleash the full potential of optoacoustic imaging in fundamental studies and translational uses.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs)&#160;are&#160;largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor&#160;primary solvation sheath&#160;and inner&#8208;Helmholtz&#160;configurations for robust zinc anode.&#160;Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation&#160;process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O&#160;with charge carriers through&#160;relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+.&#160;Thus, interfacial&#160;side reactions&#160;can be&#160;suppressed&#160;through a shielding effect.&#160;Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons&#160;of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial&#160;affinity of metallic&#160;zinc, associated with exclusion&#160;of neighboring&#160;water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800 hours&#160;at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2&#160;for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 4 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 mAh cm&#8208;2&#160;for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10&#160;cell maintains 80.3% of initial discharge capacity after 3000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1&#160;and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Dissolution of Active Sites in 80 &#176;C Alkaline Water Electrolysis by Oxyanion Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80 &#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe&#8208;based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;LDH active sites at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25&#8208;fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases.Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5 V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7% and 51.6 %, at &#8208;40 oC and &#8208;60 oC, respectively, indicating great potential for low&#8208; and&#160;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration,emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8208;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8208;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8208;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A&#8208;D&#8208;A Type Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors with a Bulky 3D Substituent at the Central Donor Core to Minimize Non&#8208;Radiative Losses and Enhance Organic Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing narrow bandgap acceptors that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and strong crystallinity is a highly effective, yet challenging, approach to reducing non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#8710;Enr) and boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have successfully designed and synthesized an A&#8208;D&#8208;A type fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, named DM&#8208;F, which features a planar molecular backbone adorned with bulky three&#8208;dimensional camphane side groups at its central core. These bulky substituents effectively hinder the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of the acceptors, promoting the formation of more J&#8208;aggregates and notably elevating the PLQY of the acceptor in the film. As anticipated, DM&#8208;F showcases pronounced near&#8208;infrared absorption coupled with impressive crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) leveraging DM&#8208;F exhibit a high EQEEL value and remarkably low &#8710;Enr of 0.137 eV&#8208;currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM&#8208;F has reached 16.16% and 20.09%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow bandgap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#8710;Enr and improve the PCE of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels, such as CH4, is highly desirable due to its high mass&#8208;energy density. Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p&#8208;block materials is hindered by non&#8208;ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure&#8208;function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p&#8208;band center of the p&#8208;block Bi element leading to formation of Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi&#8208;6p orbital electrons and p band center (&#8208;0.64) enhance the coupling between C&#8208;2p of *CHO and Bi&#8208;6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2%) and productivity (17.4 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO&#8208;&#8208;*CHO process, activates the C&#8208;H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. This work provides a new perspective on developing p&#8208;block elements for selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p-block materials is hindered by non-ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure-function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano-type structure-function relationship for photocatalytic CO2-to-CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p-band center of the p-block Bi element leading to formation of Bi-oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi-oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi-6p orbital electrons and p band center (-0.64) enhance the coupling between C-2p of *CHO and Bi-6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2%) and productivity (17.4 &#181;mol g-1 h-1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi-oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO--*CHO process, activates the C-H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2-to-CH4 conversion.

         <title>Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to achieve remediation of nitrate&#8208;polluted wastewater and sustainable production of ammonia. However, it is still restricted by the low activity, selectivity and Faraday efficiency for ammonia synthesis. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to modulate the electrolyte microenvironment in electrical double layer (EDL) by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte to enhance the NO3RR performance. Taking bulk Cu as a model catalyst, the experimental study reveals that the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in different electrolytes follows the trend Li+ &lt; Cs+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+. Theoretical studies illustrate that the proton transport rate in NO3RR and the activity of the rate&#8208;determining step (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) increase in the order Li+ &lt; Cs+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+. The cation effects are also general for two typical nanostructured catalysts including copper/cuprous oxide and nickel phosphides, achieving near&#8208;100% Faradaic efficiency and over 99% conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NO3&#8722; can be converted to high&#8208;purity NH4Cl by copper/cuprous oxide catalyst in K+&#8208;containing electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarizing Small Molecules using Parahydrogen and Solid&#8208;State Spin Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an inexpensive way to produce hyperpolarized molecules with polarization levels of &gt;10% in the solution&#8208;state, but is strongly limited in generality since it requires chemical reactions/interactions with H2. Here we report a new method to widen the scope of PHIP hyperpolarization: a source molecule is produced via PHIP with high 13C polarization, and precipitated out of solution together with a target species. Spin diffusion within the solid carries the polarization onto 13C spins of the target, which can then be dissolved for solution&#8208;state applications. We name this method PHIP&#8208;SSD (PHIP with solid&#8208;state spin diffusion) and demonstrate it using PHIP&#8208;polarized [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;fumarate as the source molecule, to polarize different 13C&#8208;labelled target molecules. 13C polarizations of between 0.01 and 3% were measured on [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid, depending on the molar ratio of fumarate:benzoate in the solid state. We also show that PHIP&#8208;SSD does not require specific co&#8208;crystallization conditions by grinding dry powders of target molecules together with solid fumarate crystals, and obtain 13C signal enhancements of between 100 and 200 on [13C,15N2]&#8208;urea, [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;pyruvate, and [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid. This approach appears to be a promising new strategy for facile hyperpolarization based on PHIP.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Helium Sieving from Hydrogen Using Fluorine&#8208;Decorated Carbon Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular&#160;size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8208;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM&#8208;550&#8208;F&#8208;1min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed&#8208;gas separation performance, with a binary mixed&#8208;gas He/H2 selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed&#8208;gas He/(H2+CO2) selectivity of 20.8, at 40 bar feed pressure and 35 oC, surpassing all previously reported polymer&#8208;based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long&#8208;term continuous stability over 30 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic Deposition&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Thin Glass MOF Films for High&#8208;Performance Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional methods that lead to glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, the proposed cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted approach can produce glass MOF films with a thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m. The fabricated thin glass ZIF&#8208;62 film shows a record&#8208;high CO2 permeance without compromising the selectivity in CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations.







Abstract
Glass metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be fabricated from their crystalline counterparts through a melt&#8208;quenching process and are prospective candidates for gas separation because of the elimination of the grain boundaries in crystalline MOF films. However, current techniques are limited to producing glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, which leads to ultralow gas permeances. Here, we report a novel cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted synthesis of glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness as low as ~1&#8197;&#956;m. Electrochemical analyses and deposition experiments suggest that the cathodic deposition can lead to pure crystalline ZIF&#8208;62 films with a controllable thickness of ~2&#8197;&#956;m to ~15&#8197;&#956;m. Accordingly, glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness of ~1&#8197;&#956;m to ~10&#8197;&#956;m can be obtained after a thermal treatment. The fabricated defect&#8208;free glass ZIF&#8208;62 film measuring 2&#8197;&#956;m in thickness shows a remarkable CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 31.4 and 33.4, respectively, with a CO2 permeance which is over 30 times higher than the best&#8208;performing glass ZIF&#8208;62 films in literature.

         <title>Adhesion Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Biobased Microgels for Controlled Delivery of Pesticides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pectin microgels with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) are introduced as a biobased pesticide delivery system. Using Cu2+, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevent grapevine downy mildew, matching commercial pesticides. We developed biadhesive anchor peptides that self&#8208;assemble on pectin microgels and ensure tight leaf binding, providing rain resistance and prolonged fungicidal activity. P&#8208;MAPs easily degrade with natural enzymes, minimizing environmental impact.







Abstract
Widespread use of plant protection agents in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using copper as the active ingredient, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi&#8208;field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P&#8208;MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long&#8208;term impact on the environment.

         <title>Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox&#8208;Active Cationic Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of ion&#8208;exchange and redox sites, a bifunctional cationic polymeric materials tailored for iodate decontamination showcases unprecedented adsorption capacity, extremely rapid adsorption kinetics, and outstanding ion&#8208;selective performances.







Abstract
As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO3&#8722;) through ion exchange or hard acid&#8208;hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox&#8208;active cationic polymer network (SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6, [C9H10O2N5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl]n) by merging guanidino groups with ion&#8208;exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896&#8197;mg/g for IO3&#8722;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0&#8197;mg/g) or ion exchange (232&#8197;mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO3&#8722; in the presence of high concentrations of SO42&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep&#8208;removal performance for low IO3&#8722; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO3&#8722; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.

         <title>Discovery, Structure, and Engineering of a cis&#8208;Geranylfarnesyl Diphosphate Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) was discovered from Streptomyces clavuligerus. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ScGFPPS catalyzed the condensation of DMAPP, GPP, and FPP with IPP to yield six cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Structural variances between ScGFPPS and NNPS facilitated the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS to achieve high product specificity.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Prenyltransferases (cis&#8208;PTs) catalyze the sequential head&#8208;to&#8208;tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed E&#8211;Z prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing cis&#8208;C25 prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids, including three C25 and three C20 variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all&#8208;cis&#8208;C20 polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of cis&#8208;PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in cis&#8208;PTs engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Prenyltransferases (&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs) catalyze the sequential head-to-tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces clavuligerus&lt;/i&gt;. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyisoprenoids, including three C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; and three C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-PTs engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Coordination Foldamer&#8208;Based Polymer Network: from Molecular Spring to Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks with high&#8208;density molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination foldamers as monomer. This endows the materials with excellent energy dissipation and elasticity through folding and unfolding of foldamer. With increasing number of repeating units in the foldamer, the corresponding polymer network shows better mechanical performance as well as shape memory feature.







Abstract
Foldamer is a scaled&#8208;down version of coil spring, which can absorb and release energy by conformational change. Here, polymer networks with high density of molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based foldamers as the monomer. The coiling of the foldamer is controlled by oligo(urea) ligands coordinating to chloride ions; subsequently, the folding and unfolding of foldamer conformations endow the polymer network with excellent energy dissipation and toughness. The mechanical performance of the corresponding polymer networks shows a dramatic increase from P&#8208;L2UCl (non&#8208;folding), to P&#8208;L4UCl (a full turn), and then to P&#8208;L6UCl (1.5 turns), in terms of strength (2.62&#8197;MPa; 14.26&#8197;MPa; 22.93&#8197;MPa), elongation at break (70&#8201;%; 325&#8201;%; 352&#8201;%), Young's modulus (2.69&#8197;MPa; 63.61&#8197;MPa; 141.50&#8197;MPa), and toughness (1.12&#8197;MJ/m3; 21.39&#8197;MJ/m3; 49.62&#8197;MJ/m3), respectively, which is also better than those without anion centers and the non&#8208;foldamer based counterparts. Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks. Thus, an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based materials is presented.

         <title>Lithium Pre&#8208;Storage Enables High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Stable Lithium&#8208;Enriched Silicon/Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from water&#8208;sensitive pre&#8208;lithiated silicon&#8208;based anodes, a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material is designed by lithium pre&#8208;storage. This is a new prelithiation strategy employing nano&#8208;drilled graphite with surficial lithium functional groups, which allow for the extraction of lithium to form a special unit, exhibiting both high initial Coulombic efficiency and excellent stability in air and water.







Abstract
Application of silicon&#8208;based anodes is significantly challenged by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cyclability. Traditional pre&#8208;lithiation reagents often pose safety concerns due to their unstable chemical nature. Achieving a balance between water&#8208;stability and high ICE in prelithiated silicon is a critical issue. Here, we present a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material with an ultra&#8208;high ICE of &#8805;110&#8201;% through a high&#8208;stable lithium pre&#8208;storage methodology. Lithium pre&#8208;storage prepared a nano&#8208;drilled graphite material with surficial lithium functional groups, which can form chemical bonds with adjacent silicon during high&#8208;temperature sintering. This results in an unexpected O&#8722;Li&#8722;Si interaction, leading to in situ pre&#8208;lithiation of silicon nanoparticles and providing high stability in air and water. Additionally, the lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite materials impart a combination of high ICE, high specific capacity (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long cycling stability (&gt;400 cycles). This study opens up a promising avenue for highly air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable silicon anode prelithiation methods.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle&#8208;based cocrystal system that undergoes dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism to alkyl ketones. The unique vapochromic behavior was mainly due to different solid&#8208;state superstructures and noncovalent interactions from the homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.

         <title>Biosensor Strip for Rapid On&#8208;site Assessment of Levodopa Pharmacokinetics along with Motor Performance in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to monitor L&#8208;Dopa levels on the spot reliably, rapidly, and inexpensively in outpatient settings, is demonstrated using disposable biosensor strips. The resulting hand&#8208;held calibration&#8208;free L&#8208;Dopameter system offers near real&#8208;time tracking of temporal L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles in Parkinson patients following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration. Such L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles correlate closely with the corresponding motor response trends.







Abstract
While levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the primary treatment for alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD), its efficacy is hindered by challenges such as a short half&#8208;life and inconsistent plasma levels. As PD progresses, the rising need for increased and more frequent L&#8208;Dopa doses coupled with symptom fluctuations and dyskinesias underscores the urgency for improved comprehension of the interplay between L&#8208;Dopa levels and PD motor symptoms. Addressing this critical need, we present a decentralized testing method using a disposable biosensor strip and a universal slope (U&#8208;slope) calibration&#8208;free approach. This enables reliable, rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective decentralized L&#8208;Dopa measurements from capillary blood. A pilot study with PD persons demonstrates the ability to monitor real&#8208;time L&#8208;Dopa pharmacokinetics from fingerstick blood after oral L&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Carbidopa (C&#8211;Dopa) tablet administration. Correlating capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with PD motor scores revealed a well&#8208;defined inverse correlation with temporal motor fluctuations. We compared the resulting dynamic capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with plasma L&#8208;Dopa levels using the traditional but clinically impractical high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography technique. By providing timely feedback on a proper L&#8208;Dopa dosing regimen in a decentralized and rapid fashion, this new biosensing platform will facilitate tailored optimal L&#8208;Dopa dosing, towards improving symptom management and enhancing health&#8208;related quality of life.

         <title>Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine&#8208;appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV&#8208;10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine&#8208;appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti2Ca2 clusters. The combination of hard (Ti4+) and soft (Ca2+) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV&#8208;10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV&#8208;10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO2 diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.

         <title>Controlled Biocatalytic Synthesis of a Metal Nanoparticle&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid: Demonstration for Catalytic H2&#8208;driven NADH Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions, small (&lt;10&#8197;nm), spherical, monodisperse metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesised using an NAD+ reductase enzyme as reductant and stabilizer, forming Au NPs and Au@Pt (core&#8208;shell) NPs. The enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids demonstrated promising activity as a H2&#8208;driven NADH cofactor recycling system, coupled with an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the preparation of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrids of NAD+ reductase with biocatalytically&#8208;synthesised small gold nanoparticles (NPs, &lt;10&#8197;nm) and core&#8208;shell gold&#8208;platinum NPs for tandem catalysis. Despite the variety of methods available for NP synthesis, there remains a need for more sustainable strategies which also give precise control over the shape and size of the metal NPs for applications in catalysis, biomedical devices, and electronics. We demonstrate facile biosynthesis of spherical, highly uniform, gold NPs under mild conditions using an isolated enzyme moiety, an NAD+ reductase, to reduce metal salts while oxidising a nicotinamide&#8208;containing cofactor. By subsequently introducing platinum salts, we show that core&#8208;shell Au@Pt NPs can then be formed. Catalytic function of these enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids was demonstrated for H2&#8208;driven NADH recycling to support enantioselective ketone reduction by an NADH&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly photostable and polarity&#8208;sensitive labeling agent for the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been developed, enabling visualization of mitochondrial cristae using STED microscopy. In combination with FLIM, it also allows the analysis of lipid heterogeneity at the single mitochondrion level. Time&#8208;lapse FLIM observations revealed that mitochondrial swelling is preceded by an increase in the IMM order resulting from lipid peroxidation.







Abstract
The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) undergoes dynamic morphological changes, which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions as well as cell survival. As the dynamics of the membrane are governed by its lipid components, a fluorescent probe that can sense spatiotemporal alterations in the lipid properties of the IMM over long periods of time is required to understand mitochondrial physiological functions in detail. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive IMM&#8208;labeling reagent with excellent photostability and sensitivity to its environment, which enables the visualization of the IMM ultrastructure using super&#8208;resolution microscopy as well as of the lipid heterogeneity based on the fluorescence lifetime at the single mitochondrion level. Combining the probe and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) showed that peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the IMM by reactive oxygen species caused an increase in the membrane order, which took place prior to mitochondrial swelling.

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y&#8208;stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) in the form of both well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystals (polarization&#8208;resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high&#8208;pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D2O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y3+&#8208;doping, showing superior activity for low&#8208;temperature water dissociation.







Abstract
The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion in mild electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Ni/Ni(OH)2 Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Boosts Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Ampere&#8208;Level Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of Ni core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell is fabricated through one&#8208;step electrodeposition to achieve ampere&#8208;level electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia with high efficiency. Meanwhile, it can be used to electrocatalytically upgrade methanol to formate, which decreases the energy efficiency of ammonia production in a two&#8208;electrode system. This is a favorable advancement for ammonia energy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia provides a green alternate to the Haber&#8211;Bosch method, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics and a low yield rate. The nitrate reduction follows a tandem reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent nitrite hydrogenation to generate ammonia, and the ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) is limited by the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we design a heterostructure catalyst to remedy the above issues, which consists of Ni nanosphere core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell (Ni/Ni(OH)2). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals Ni and Ni(OH)2 are interconvertible according to the applied potential, facilitating the cascade nitrate reduction synergistically. Consequently, it attains superior electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance with an ammonia FE of 98.50&#8201;% and a current density of 0.934&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.476&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and exhibits an average ammonia yield rate of 84.74&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 during the 102&#8208;hour stability test, which is highly superior to the reported catalysts tested under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations corroborate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the tandem reaction of nitrate reduction. Moreover, the Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also possesses good capability for methanol oxidation and thus is used to establish a system coupling with nitrate reduction.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Electric Field&#8208;Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 Heterostructure for High&#8208;Efficiency Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 (UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5) heterostructure with optimized interfacial electric field (IEF) is designed and fabricated for high&#8208;efficiency potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) anodes. The IEF intensity in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 is 3.65&#8197;times that of pure FeSe/Fe3Se4. Intriguingly, this uniform doping strategy has strong generality in improving IEF strength and PIB performance. As expected, amorphous carbon&#8208;coated UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (95.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
The interfacial electric field (IEF) in the heterostructure can accelerate electron transport and ion migration, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Nevertheless, the quantification and modulation of the IEF for high&#8208;efficiency PIB anodes currently remains a blank slate. Herein, we achieve for the first time the quantification and tuning of IEF via amorphous carbon&#8208;coated undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (denoted UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C) for efficient potassium storage. Co doping can increase the IEF in FeSe/Fe3Se4, thereby improving the electron transport, promoting the potassium adsorption capacity, and lowering the diffusion barrier. As expected, the IEF magnitude in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C is experimentally quantified as 62.84&#8197;mV, which is 3.65&#8197;times larger than that of amorphous carbon&#8208;coated FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (Fe4Se5/C). Benefiting from the strong IEF, UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C as a PIB anode exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle lifespan (capacity retention of 95.1&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Furthermore, this undifferentiated doping strategy can universally regulate the IEF magnitude in CoSe2/Co9Se8 and FeS2/Fe7S8 heterostructures. This work can provide fundamental insights into the design of advanced PIB electrodes.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization&#8208;Driven Template Autocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we elucidate the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by trans&#8208;amides in thermally responsive crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis. The H&#8208;bonds not only endow the product with template ability but can also thermally activate or inhibit autocatalysis by reversibly changing amide conformations. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.







Abstract
Autocatalysis has been recognized to be involved in the emergence of life and intrinsic to biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent&#8208;free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by amides in crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness. We found that the thermal&#8208;induced cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amides possibly affects the H&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated template ability of products for autocatalytic transformation. As a result, CDTA can be reversibly inhibited and activated by tuning the reaction temperatures. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed Br/Cl perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit bright pure&#8208;blue emission benefiting for fulfilling the Rec. 2100 standard. However, phase segregation remains a significant challenge that severely affects the stability and emission spectrum of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we demonstrate the optimization of the spacing between polydentate functional groups of polymer ligands to match the surface pattern of CsPbBr1.8Cl1.2 PeNCs, resulting in effective synergistic passivation effect and significant improvements in PeLED performances. The block and alternating copolymers with different inter&#8208;functional group spacing are facilely synthesized as ligands for PeNCs. Surprisingly, block copolymers with a higher functional group density do not match PeNCs, while alternating copolymers enable efficient PeNCs with the high photoluminescence intensity, low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and high exciton binding energy. Density functional theory calculations clearly confirm the almost perfect match between alternating copolymers and PeNCs. Finally, pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are achieved with the emission at 467 nm and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.131, 0.071), high external quantum efficiency (9.1%) and record spectral and operational stabilities (~ 80 mins) in mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs. Overall, this study contributes to designing the polymer ligands and promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and stable pure&#8208;color PeLEDs towards display applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Atomic&#8208;coupling in Dual&#8208;cavity Boride Nanoreactor to Achieve Hierarchical Catalytic Engineering for Sulfur Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic process of Li2S formation is considered a key pathway to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Due to the system's complexity, the catalytic behavior is uncertain, posing significant challenges for predicting activity. Herein, we report a novel cascaded dual&#8208;cavity nanoreactor (NiCo&#8208;B) by controlling reaction kinetics, providing an opportunity for achieving hierarchical catalytic behavior. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the multilevel structure can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and accelerate sulfur conversion. Furthermore, we differentiate the adsorption (B&#8208;S) and catalytic effect (Co&#8208;S) in NiCo&#8208;B, avoiding catalyst deactivation caused by excessive adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared battery displays high reversible capacity, even with sulfur loading of 13.2 mg cm&#8208;2 (E/S=4 &#956;l mg&#8208;1), the areal capacity can reach 18.7 mAh cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Functionalization of Cyclopropenes via Cyclopropenium Cation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes is reported. Starting from a broad range of redox&#8208;active ester&#8208;substituted cyclopropenes, cyclopropenylphthalimides can be synthesized in the absence of a nucleophile. Alternatively, different carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles can be introduced. The transformation proceeds most probably through the formation of an aromatic cyclopropenium cation, followed by trapping with the nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis on a Tandem Ruthenium&#8211;Platinum&#8211;Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough for the rapidity of the multiple processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8208;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts with the metal&#8208;support synergy effect to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8208;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293 min&#8208;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8208;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Chiral Metal Nanoclusters for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is of great significance in various applications such as drug identification, sensing and imaging. Atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters with intense circular dichroism (CD) signals are promising candidates for CPL detection, which can further facilitate device miniaturization and integration. Herein, we report the preparation of a pair of optically active chiral silver nanoclusters [Ag7(R/S&#8208;DMA)2(dpppy)3] (BF4)3 (R/S&#8208;Ag7) for direct CPL detection. The crystal structure and molecular formula of R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters exhibit strong CD spectra and CPL luminescence both in solution and solid states. When used as the photoactive materials in photodetectors, R/S&#8208;Ag7 enables effective discrimination between left&#8208;handed circularly polarized and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light at 520 nm with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This study is the first report on using atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters for CPL detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Charge&#8208;Neutral Anion Receptors for Reversible Binding and Release of Highly Hydrated Phosphate in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control&#160;of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8208;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1 &#8208; L4), which were equipped with morpholine and PEG terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8208; anion in a 1:1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#180;103 M&#8208;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.</dc:description>

Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge-neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1 - L4), which were equipped with morpholine and PEG terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH-triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43- anion in a 1:1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#180;103 M-1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH-triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>

         <dc:description>
An intricate interconvertible system composed of four chiral species of diphane has been studied. The complex structural changes can be dissected into two pathways: a slow C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configurational interconversion and a rapid P&#8208; to M&#8208;conformational transition. As the latter is much faster than the former, the latter can be further deconvolved into two individual conformational interchanges: (P)&#8208;C3&#8596;(M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1&#8596;(M)&#8208;C1.







Abstract
Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for the C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion, while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As kobs

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO&#8208;95A in Escherichia coli after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co&#8208;expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug&#8208;activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77 s&#8208;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8722;Teller&#8208;active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the directly formation of oxygen&#8722;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8722;Teller (J&#8722;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (t2g3eg1) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in&#8208;situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8722;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of catalyst&#8217;s electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Backbone Editing for Controlled Degradation of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically inert nature of fully saturated hydrocarbon backbones endows vinyl polymers with desirable durability, but it also leads to their significant environmental persistence. Enhancing the sustainability of these materials requires a pivotal yet challenging shift: transforming the inert backbone into one that is degradable. Here, we present a versatile platform for mechanochemically editing the fully saturated backbone of vinyl polymers towards degradable polymer chains by integrating cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide (CBS) units along backbone through photo&#8208;iniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball&#8208;milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.</dc:description>

Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball-milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tafbromin selectively targets the TAF1 bromodomain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenotypic assays detect small molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class as osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Ampere&#8208;level Current Density on Doping&#8208;engineered Bismuth Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95% at 2000 mA cm&#8208;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95%) with current densities from 100 to 1300 mA cm&#8208;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700 mA cm&#8208;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situspectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Inhibitor Possessing Isoform Selectivity and In Planta Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins has been developed. The inhibitor displayed isoform selectivity through covalent and allosteric inhibitory action. Inhibitor&#8208;driven stomatal closing on Arabidopsis leaves was also investigated. This inhibitor provides new insight into the modulation of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and the application to plant growth regulation.







Abstract
Synthetic modulators of plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Herein, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate over Phosphate&#8208;Modified In: Water Activation and Active Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can act as anchoring sites to enrich K+(H2O)n close to the In active sites in the double layer and activate K+(H2O)n to generate H+. Besides, (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can also modulate the electronic structure of the In active sites, resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption. Both of which shall facilitate the electrochemical CO2RR to form formate.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified oxide&#8208;derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1&#8201;% at a partial current density of ~200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cathodic potential of &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra&#8208;cluster and inter&#8208;cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.







Abstract
Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA=4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Like Silicone Nanofilaments@Montmorillonite Nanofillers of PEO&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries with Wide Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. The SSLMBs with the CSEs show high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs&#8217; limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, 30&#8201;&#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3&#8197;V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50&#8201;&#176;C to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.

         <title>Back Cover: Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

         <title>Inside Cover: Activating and Stabilizing a Reversible four Electron Redox Reaction of I&#8722;/I+ for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy density of aqueous zinc ion batteries is greatly affected by the low energy density, low potential and low power density of the cathode material. In their Research Article (e202403187), Xijin Xu, Huiqiao Li et&#8197;al. report a method to activate and stabilize a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction between I&#8722; and I+ by introducing Br&#8722; as a mediator, which greatly promotes the capacity and effectively suppresses iodine shuttling for high cycling stability.

Enantiopure irida[6]helicenes combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment are obtained by dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile [4]helicenic ligands. These compounds exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals, as described by Carlos M. Cruz, Fernando P. Coss&#237;o, Zoraida Freixa, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202406663).

The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision were reported by Lingwen Liao, Jun Yang, and Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402565). The as&#8208;obtained Pt23 nanoclusters via a mixture ligand protecting strategy exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, without requiring calcination or other treatments. An excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was also revealed, indicating great potential for applications of such materials.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Stereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Photo&#8208;Driven Sequential Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements can occur owing to a continuously decreasing energy of three key intermediates and the final product, as illustrated in the cover image and reported by Lu Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202400805). The background is the ancient Chinese transmission devices before Qin Dynasty.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;Induced Cluster Consolidation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Sieving Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation renders JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP a shrinkage of the 1D channels in the c&#8208;axis direction, allowing complete exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while maintaining high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98&#8201;% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5&#8201;% purity and close to 90&#8201;% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8722;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) has been prepared by replacing &#8722;Br in Ti3C2Br2 with gas&#8208;phase P. Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) powder is directly obtained and the atomic content of P reaches the theoretical atomic percentage content. Compared to MXene Ti3C2Br2 with the &#8722;Br functional groups, the areal capacitance of Ti3C2PBrx with &#8722;P functional groups has increased by about 3.6&#8197;times at scan rates of 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate has not decreased after 10000&#8197;cycles. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.







Abstract
MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8722;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8722;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8722;Br is replaced with &#8722;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). At a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 10000&#8197;cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts loaded on ultrathin CdS nanosheets (Ru1/CdS), which efficiently catalyze biomass&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to produce amino acids under visible light irradiation. The optimal system predominates the conventional thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems in terms of conversion, selectivity, yield, and amino acid formation rates.







Abstract
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#8197;molAla&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 1.7&#8197;times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8722;H bond dissociation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8722;OH and CH3&#8722;CH&#8722;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cell.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematically experimental and computational investigation on the catalytic performances of the bifunctional and binary organoborane catalysts are performed to explore the origination of the catalytic differences in terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride, where gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers and tapered diblock terpolymers were afforded respectively.







Abstract
Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.

         <title>Electrophilic Hydrosilylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes Derived from Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;Electron Pt(II) germyl complexes bearing small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) catalyze the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrosilylation (anti SiH bond addition) of electron&#8208;rich alkenes derived from enamines, thus producing &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. On the contrary, using bulkier NHC ligands promotes the competitive silylative dehydrocoupling process. Mechanistic studies point to unprecedented outer&#8208;sphere Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformations.







Abstract
The low&#8208;electron count, air&#8208;stable, platinum complexes [Pt(ItBu&#8217;)(ItBu)][BArF] (C1) (ItBu=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C2) (ItBuiPr=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;iso&#8208;propylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C3), [Pt(GePh3)(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C4), [Pt(GePh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C5) and [Pt(GeEt)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C6) (ItBuMe=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are efficient catalysts (particularly the germyl derivatives) in both the silylative dehydrocoupling and hydrosilylation of electron rich alkenes derived from enamines. The steric hindrance exerted by the NHC ligand plays an important role in the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, bulky ligands are selective towards the silylative dehydrocoupling process whereas less sterically hindered promote the selective hydrosilylation reaction. The latter is, in addition, regioselective towards the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of both internal and terminal enamines, leading to &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. Moreover, the syn stereochemistry of the amino and silyl groups implies an anti Si&#8722;H bond addition across the double bond. All these facts point to a mechanistic picture that, according to experimental and computational studies, involves a non&#8208;classical hydrosilylation process through an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in which a formal nucleophilic addition of the enamine to the silicon atom of a platinum &#963;&#8208;SiH complex is the key step. This is in sharp contrast with the classical Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism prevalent in platinum chemistry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe&#8208;SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.







Abstract
Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro&#8208;oxidative ring&#8208;opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe&#8208;SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram&#8208;scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single-electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe-SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe-SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation-pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe-SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro-oxidative ring-opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe-SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram-scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Record External Quantum Efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% in Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Hot Exciton Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>
An ingenious strategy is for the first time proposed to develop solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings onto the HLCT emitting core. With outstanding characteristics of these emitters, the unprecedented OLED performances with a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% and high colour purity are achieved, showing competitive superiority for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.







Abstract
High performance solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue emitters with a Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of CIEy&#8804;0.08 are highly desired in ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. Although, deep&#8208;blue materials with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state feature are promising candidates, their rigidity and planar molecular structures limit their application in solution&#8208;processing technique. Herein, four novel deep&#8208;blue solution&#8208;processable HLCT emitters were first proposed by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings as functional units onto the HLCT emitting core. The functional units not only improve solubility, enhance thermal properties and morphological stability of the emitting core, but also promote photoluminescence efficiency, balance charge carrier transport, and inhibit aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect due to the weak electron&#8208;withdrawing property as well as steric hindrance. The corresponding solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 11.5&#8201;% with an emission peak at 456&#8197;nm and excellent colour purity (full width at half maximum=56&#8197;nm and CIEy=0.09). These efficiencies represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance among the solution&#8208;processable blue OLEDs based on the &#8220;hot exciton&#8221; mechanism. This simple strategy opens up a new avenue for designing highly efficient solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Monodisperse Micron&#8208;Sized Polymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method is developed here for the first time on the preparation of monodisperse micron&#8208;sized vesicles from an alternating copolymer. Small nanodisks are formed in solution first, which act as seeds to initiate the subsequent growth into circular nanosheets, curved nanosheets, spherical crowns, and final uniform vesicles.







Abstract
Artificial vesicles are recognized as powerful platforms for a large body of research across the disciplines of chemistry, physics and biology. Despite the great progress, control of the size distribution to make uniform vesicles remains fundamentally difficult due to the highly uncontrollable growth kinetics, especially for micron&#8208;sized vesicles. Here we report a template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method to prepare monodisperse vesicles around 1&#8197;&#956;m from an alternating copolymer. The polymer forms nanodisks (ca. 9&#8197;nm) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), acting as seeds for subsequent growth. By adding water, the nanodisks gradually grow into larger circular bilayer nanosheets, which bend to crowns and continue to grow into uniform micron&#8208;sized vesicles. The first&#8208;order growth kinetics as well as the small size polydispersity index (&lt;0.1) suggests the living self&#8208;assembly characteristics. This work paves a new way in both living self&#8208;assembly and monodisperse polymer vesicles.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Field Induced Synthesis of Ultrafine&#8208;Sized High&#8208;Entropy Compounds with Excellent Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited in the high&#8208;pressure field to achieve the general formation of ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy compounds (HECs). Their unique advantages of ultrafine size, carbon incorporation, and high entropy effect enable them to have excellent reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage reaction kinetics and capacities.







Abstract
Emerging high entropy compounds (HECs) have attracted huge attention in electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications. The features of ultrafine size and carbon incorporation show great potential to boost the ion&#8208;storage kinetics of HECs. However, they are rarely reported because high&#8208;temperature calcination tends to result in larger crystallites, phase separation, and carbon reduction. Herein, using the NaCl self&#8208;assembly template method, by introducing a high&#8208;pressure field in the calcination process, the atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited for the general formation of HECs, and the HEC aggregation is inhibited for obtaining ultrafine size. The general preparation of ultrafine&#8208;sized (&lt;10&#8197;nm) HECs (nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphates) anchored on porous carbon composites is realized. They are demonstrated by combining advanced characterization technologies with theoretical computations. Ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy sulfides&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation. Our work provides a new opportunity for designing and fabricating ultrafine&#8208;sized HECs.

         <title>A Universal Self&#8208;Propagating Synthesis of Aluminum&#8208;Based Oxyhalide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+).







Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, the current method of SSE preparation usually involves high&#8208;energy mechanical ball milling and/or a high&#8208;temperature annealing process, which is not suitable for practical application. Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+). It is elucidated that the amorphous matrix, which mainly consists of various oxidized chloroaluminate species that provide numerous sites for smooth ion migration, is actually the key factor for the achieved high conductivities. Benefit from their easy synthesis, low cost, and low weight, the aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs synthesized by our approach could further promote practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The forest, a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo&#8208;ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article (e202402915), Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose&#8208;based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo&#8208;ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90:10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98:2 er) and 36&#8208;74% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85:15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 177 mAh g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600mAh g&#8722;1 below 2.5 V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#160;dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and&#160;coordination&#160;tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The&#160;gCPL&#160;value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54,&#160;which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements,&#160;single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses&#160;and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the&#160;gCPL&#160;value.&#160;The emission quantum yield and&#160;photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than that with previous Cs+.&#160;Based on the systematic&#160;modifications and analyses for chiral&#160;tetrakis&#160;Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Nanowire Networks by Microfluidic Laminar Flow Synthesis for Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great research interest in two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) due to their large specific surface area and abundance of unsaturated coordination atoms, their controllable synthesis still remains a significant challenge. Herein, a microfluidics laminar flow&#8208;based approach is developed, enabling the facile preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D structures with diverse alloy compositions, such as PtBi, AuBi, PdBi, PtPdBi, and PtAuCu alloys. Remarkably, these 2D MNWNs can reach sizes up to submillimeter scale (~220 &#956;m), which is significantly larger than the evolution from the 1D or 3D counterparts that typically measure only tens of nanometers. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the highest specific activity for formic acid (2669.1 mA mg&#8208;1) among current unsupported catalysts, which is 103.5 times higher than Pt&#8208;black, respectively. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments provide comprehensive evidence that PdBi 2D MNWNs catalysts can effectively prevent CO* poisoning, resulting in exceptional activity and stability for the oxidation of formic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8208;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, stereochemistries of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low&#160;Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8208;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to active oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Functional Liquid&#8208;Based Interfaces: From Mechanism to Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces, with their inhomogeneous regions that emphasize the functionalized liquids, have attracted much interest as a versatile platform for a broad spectrum of applications, from chemical manufacturing to practical uses. These interfaces leverage the physicochemical characteristics of liquids, alongside dynamic behaviors induced by macroscopic wettability and microscopic molecular exchange balance, to allow for tailored properties within their functional structures. In this Minireview, we provide a foundational overview of these functional interfaces, based on the structural investigations and molecular mechanisms of interaction forces that directly modulate functionalities. Then, we discuss design strategies that have been employed in recent applications, and the crucial aspects that require focus. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces and provide a perspective on future research directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational  Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Through crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulation and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on this result, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1:12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99:1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Transformation of Amorphous Supramolecular Coating to Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane to Trigger Selective Gas Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in&#8208;situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method&#8217;s broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx&#160;Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to LIBs in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the dendrites growth. Here, we develop an amorphous FeSnOx nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8208;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 forms an amorphous/crystalline interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1mg cm&#8208;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus = 4.9GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8208;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3mAh g&#8208;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% after 400 cycles at 0.5C.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Radical C&#8208;C Coupling from Carboxylic Acids with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective coupling of two different radicals is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the process occurring statistically. Generally, the cross&#8208;coupling selectivity is achieved by the persistent radical effect (PRE), resulting in limited radical precursors. In this paper, a highly selective cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl radicals with acyl radicals to construct C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds, or with alkyl radicals to construct C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds have been achieved with the readily available carboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI ester) as coupling partners. The success originates from the use of tridentate ligand (L1) to enable radical cross&#8208;coupling process to Ni&#8208;mediated organometallic mechanism. This protocol offers a facile and flexible access to structurally diverse ketones (up to 90% yield), and also a new solution for the challenging double decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling. The broad utility and functional group tolerance are further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural&#8208;occurring carboxylic acids and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8208;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170 &#176;C and 1 atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8208;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8 h, producing 100 nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80 h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700 Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8208;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8208;500 nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method&#8217;s potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor (such as facet, phase etc.) behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially for possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is demonstrated to unprecedentedly reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The presence of in situ formed silicide can significantly enhance photovoltage and deliver a record&#8208;high onset potential above &#8208;0.4 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE) for photoelectrochemical CH4 production. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu/Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8208;Cu distance, which efficiently restricts the C&#8208;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Chelating Intermediate for Air&#8208;Processed Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite holds promise as a prime candidate in the realm of perovskite photovoltaics. However, the photo&#8208;active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase, existing as a metastable state, is observable solely at elevated temperatures and is susceptible to degradation into the &#948;&#8208;phase in ambient air. Therefore, the attainment of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 in ambient conditions has become a crucial objective in perovskite research. Here, we proposed an efficient conversion process of PbI2 into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskites in ambient air. This conversion was facilitated by the introduction of chelating molecules, which interacted with PbI2 to form an intermediate phase. Due to the reduced formation barrier resulting from the altered reaction pathway, this stable intermediate phase transitioned directly into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 upon the deposition of the organic cation solution, effectively bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08%, along with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19 V. Furthermore, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated remarkable environmental stability. Notably, this innovative approach promises broad applicability across various chelating molecules, opening new avenues for further progress in the ambient air fabrication of FAPbI3 PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34 times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Radical 1,2&#8208;Azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;involved multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has recently emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds in one&#8208;pot operation. However, the expansion of radical scope and enantiocontrol remain two major challenges. Herein, we describe an unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids. This mild&#160;protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8211;0.94 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2% at &#8211;0.74 V vs. RHE. In&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8208;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8208;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8208;N coupling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Ring Opening with vinylbenzofurans Enabled by Triazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H
annulation using readily available 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans as the reaction
pattern. The redox&#8208;neutral strategy, based on cheap, non&#8208;toxic and
earth abundant iron catalysts, exploits triazole assistance to promote
a cascade C&#8722;H alkylation, benzofuran ring&#8208;opening and insertion into
a Fe&#8722;N bond, to form highly functionalized isoquinolones. Detailed
mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations fully disclosed the
manifold of the iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA = methylammonium; X = Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5 &#177; 0.08) &#215; 105 cm GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22 &#215; 10&#8722;5 J cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven&#160;to be&#160;transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this&#160;compound class&#160;is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4'&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4'&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4'&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4'&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis&#160;in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Organo&#8208;electrocatalysis System for the Chlor&#8208;related Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165 TW h), the chlor&#8208;alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non&#8208;negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal&#8208;free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl2) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92 mV to reach a current density of 1000mA cm&#8208;2, with a small cost of only 0.002 $ g&#8208;1. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, serving as the foundation for an innovative approach to the design of efficient anodes for the COP.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97% e.e., &gt;20:1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible to dissipate elastic energy, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading&#8208;unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2 mS cm&#8208;1 (25 &#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room&#8208;temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3 V&#8208;class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled SPE can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface and sustainability challenges of solid&#8208;state LMBs.</dc:description>

Here, we propose a dual-bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+-dissociation co-polymer chains, where the -C-N- bond maintains the load-bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non-spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible to dissipate elastic energy, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading-unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2 mS cm-1 (25 &#176;C) and chemical recyclability.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Properties of Trioxa[9]circulene and Diepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trioxa[9]circulene and dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene were synthesized through intramolecular oxidative coupling of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene, resulting in the formation of a nine&#8208;membered ring. Dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene and dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, and trioxa[9]circulene exhibits remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the crystals.







Abstract
This article presents trioxa[9]circulene (3) as a novel member of hetero[n]circulenes. Its synthesis began with the synthesis of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene (5) and used dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene (4) as a key intermediate, despite the condensation reaction predominantly yielding a 1,4&#8208;addition byproduct. The structures and properties of 3&#8211;5 were extensively investigated using experimental and computational methods. Analysis of the crystal structures reveal elongation of the internal C&#8722;C bonds in the nine&#8208;membered ring of 3 compared to 4 and 5. Computational studies demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of trioxa[9]circulene's saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic framework, while the other two compounds are rigid with large racemization barriers. Optically pure forms of 4 and 5 exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, with smaller values observed for compound 4. In the crystal structures, molecules of 3 stack to form columns with remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of 4 exhibit short intermolecular C&#8208;to&#8208;C contacts. Consequently, the solution&#8208;processed film of 4 functioned as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor in field effect transistors.

         <title>Interphase Engineering via Solvent Molecule Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) renders modified interphase and remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. It also renders stable performance of pouch Li&#8208;S battery.







Abstract
Lithium metal battery has been regarded as promising next&#8208;generation battery system aiming for higher energy density. However, the lithium metal anode suffers severe side&#8208;reaction and dendrite issues. Its electrochemical performance is significantly dependant on the electrolyte components and solvation structure. Herein, a series of fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) enables remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% (25&#8201;&#176;C) as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO2. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintains 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 50&#8197;cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Selective Carbosilylation: Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reaction of Solid Me3SiZnI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a unique approach for the selective synthesis of stereodefined trisubstituted vinylsilanes via the anti&#8208;selective addition of a novel solid Me3SiZnI to terminal alkynes. An equilibrium exists between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts, where the anti&#8208;selectivity is determined by the larger barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct.







Abstract
The stereodefined and highly substituted vinylsilanes are essential building blocks for constructing complex organic molecules. Transition metal&#8208;mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn&#8208;adduct, and the anti&#8208;selective cross&#8208;coupling is still unknown and highly desired. Silylzinc reagents are highly functional group tolerant, however, their synthesis from pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts hampers cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Our novel solid silylzinc reagents circumvent these constraints are employed in the anti&#8208;selective synthesis of vinylsilanes via a multi&#8208;component reaction involving Me3SiZnI, terminal alkynes, and activated alkyl halides. An intensive computational and experimental investigation of the mechanism reveals an equilibrium between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts; the greater barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct determine the anti&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost *OOH Intermediate Generation in Cu/In2Se3 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong electronic metal&#8211;support interactions between Cu and In2Se3 cause the charge rearrangement, which is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation. The introduction of Cu not only reduces the energy of the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction intermediate but also inhibits the 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, which facilitates the efficient production of H2O2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising method for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, high energy barriers for the generation of key *OOH intermediates hinder the process of 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, we prepared a copper&#8208;supported indium selenide catalyst (Cu/In2Se3) to enhance the selectivity and yield of 2e&#8722; ORR by employing an electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSIs) strategy. EMSIs&#8208;induced charge rearrangement between metallic Cu and In2Se3 is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation, promoting H2O2 production. Theoretical investigations reveal that the inclusion of Cu significantly lowers the energy barrier of the 2e&#8722; ORR intermediate and impedes the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway, thus favoring the formation of H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 produced by Cu/In2Se3 is ~2&#8197;times than In2Se3, and Cu/In2Se3 shows promising applications in antibiotic degradation. This research presents a valuable approach for the future utilization of EMSIs in 2e&#8722; ORR.

Charge transfer between donor Ir(III) and acceptor Pt(IV) introduces synergistic activity for these photodynamic and phototherapeutic centres, 1O2 and radical generation, higher Pt accumulation, and damages cell nuclei and releases chromosomes. X&#8208;ray fluorescence revealed a broad distribution in cells, with Ir localised in small compartments, some as a cleaved fragment.







Abstract
The novel hetero&#8208;dinuclear complex trans,trans,trans&#8208;[PtIV(py)2(N3)2(OH)(&#956;&#8208;OOCCH2CH2CONHCH2&#8208;bpyMe)IrIII(ppy)2]Cl (Pt&#8208;Ir), exhibits charge transfer between the acceptor photochemotherapeutic Pt(IV) (Pt&#8208;OH) and donor photodynamic Ir(III) (Ir&#8208;NH2) fragments. It is stable in the dark, but undergoes photodecomposition more rapidly than the Pt(IV) parent complex (Pt&#8208;OH) to generate Pt(II) species, an azidyl radical and 1O2. The Ir(III)* excited state, formed after irradiation, can oxidise NADH to NAD&#8901; radicals and NAD+. Pt&#8208;Ir is highly photocytotoxic towards cancer cells with a high photocytotoxicity index upon irradiation with blue light (465&#8197;nm, 4.8&#8197;mW/cm2), even with short light&#8208;exposure times (10&#8211;60&#8197;min). In contrast, the mononuclear Pt&#8208;OH and Ir&#8208;NH2 subunits and their simple mixture are much less potent. Cellular Pt accumulation was higher for Pt&#8208;Ir compared to Pt&#8208;OH. Irradiation of Pt&#8208;Ir in cancer cells damages nuclei and releases chromosomes. Synchrotron&#8208;XRF revealed ca. 4&#215; higher levels of intracellular platinum compared to iridium in Pt&#8208;Ir treated cells under dark conditions. Luminescent Pt&#8208;Ir distributes over the whole cell and generates ROS and 1O2 within 1&#8197;h of irradiation. Iridium localises strongly in small compartments, suggestive of complex cleavage and excretion via recycling vesicles (e.g. lysosomes). The combination of PDT and PACT motifs in one molecule, provides Pt&#8208;Ir with a novel strategy for multimodal phototherapy.

         <title>Activable Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Assembled from &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthalenediimide for Precision Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;immunomodulator consisting of glutathione activable resiquimod and &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing system is engineered for spatiotemporally controlled photothermal immunotherapy. The synergistic immunity and photothermal effect lead to complete tumor ablation against both primary and distal tumors, presenting a generic strategy for engineering nano&#8208;immunomodulator to achieve a precise regulation of photothermal immunotherapy.







Abstract
A nano&#8208;immunomodulator (R&#8208;NPT NP) comprising a tumor microenvironment (TME) activable resiquimod (R848) and a &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing naphthophenanthrolinetetraone (NPT) has been engineered for spatiotemporal controlled photothermal immunotherapy. R&#8208;NPT NP demonstrated excellent photostability, while R848 promoted synergistic immunity as a toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, R&#8208;NPT NP released R848 in response to redox metabolite glutathione (GSH), triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation. The photothermal effect endowed by R&#8208;NPT NP can ablate tumors directly and trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunity after photoirradiation. The synergistic effect of GSH&#8208;liable TLR7/8 agonist and released immunogenic factors leads to a robust evocation of systematic immunity through promoted DC maturation and T cell infiltration. Thus, R&#8208;NPT NP with photoirradiation achieved 99.3&#8201;% and 98.2&#8201;% growth inhibition against primary and distal tumors, respectively.

         <title>Direct Observation of Polaritonic Chemistry by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Fabry&#8208;Perot optical cavities were developed that enable studying Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the London dispersion&#8208;driven conformational equilibrium of a molecular balance is altered when the C&#8722;H stretching vibration is strongly coupled to the cavity. Unexpectedly, VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions which has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry.







Abstract
Polaritonic chemistry is emerging as a powerful approach to modifying the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials. However, probing how the electronics and dynamics of molecular systems change under strong coupling has been challenging due to the narrow range of spectroscopic techniques that can be applied in situ. Here we develop microfluidic optical cavities for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that are compatible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using standard liquid NMR tubes. VSC is shown to influence the equilibrium between two conformations of a molecular balance sensitive to London dispersion forces, revealing an apparent change in the equilibrium constant under VSC. In all compounds studied, VSC does not induce detectable changes in chemical shifts, J&#8208;couplings, or spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times. This unexpected finding indicates that VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions, and in turn has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry under VSC and suggests that the emergence of collective behavior is critical.

         <title>Universal crRNA Acylation Strategy for Robust Photo&#8208;Initiated One&#8208;Pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a Nucleic Acid Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and accessible acylation strategy for fabricating cloaked crRNA to realize photo&#8208;initiated one&#8208;pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a assays regardless of the crRNA sequences has been developed. This innovative acylation strategy can bring great advantages and convenience in photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies, highlighting their potential in genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyls (2&#8242;&#8208;OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO&#8208;Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One&#8208;pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one&#8208;step assay and comparable to the two&#8208;step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high&#8208;efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold&#8208;standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies for one&#8208;pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR&#8208;based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.

The electrocatalytic 2eORR activity of the graphdiyne catalyst toward H2O2 production is successfully adjusted by steering the sp&#8208;carbon content in graphdiyne from 20&#8197;at&#8201;% to 50&#8197;at&#8201;%.







Abstract
Compared to sp2&#8208;hybridized graphene, graphdiynes (GDYs) composed of sp and sp2 carbon are highly promising as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction into oxygen peroxide because of the high catalytic reactivity of the electron&#8208;rich sp&#8208;carbon atoms. The desired catalytic capacity of GDY, such as catalytic selectivity and efficiency, can theoretically be achieved by strategically steering the sp&#8208;carbon contents or the topological arrangement of the acetylenic linkages and aromatic bonds. Herein, we successfully tuned the electrocatalytic activity of GDYs by regulating the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratios with different organic monomer precursors. As the active sp&#8208;carbon atoms possess electron&#8208;sufficient &#960; orbitals, they can donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of O2 molecules and initiate subsequent O2 reduction, GDY with the high sp&#8208;carbon content of 50&#8197;at&#8201;% exhibits excellent capability of catalyzing O2 reduction into H2O2. It demonstrates exceptional H2O2 selectivity of over 95.0&#8201;% and impressive performance in practical H2O2 production, Faraday efficiency (FE) exceeding 99.0&#8201;%, and a yield of 83.3&#8197;nmol&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our work holds significant importance in effectively steering the inherent properties of GDYs by purposefully adjusting the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratio and highlights their immense potential for research and applications in catalysis and other fields.

         <title>Multipolar Conjugated Polymer Framework Derived Ionic Sieves via Electronic Modulation for Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano and fluorine dual&#8208;polar&#8208;group decorated multipolar polymer framework namely CNF&#8208;COF has been explored as an efficient and stable ionic sieve via electronic modulation to composite with solid polymer electrolytes for long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li batteries at high rate. The CNF&#8208;COF incorporation not only affords rapid selective Li ion conduction, but also enables the LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation for stable Li anodes. Thus, the newly&#8208;developed composite electrolytes with an ultralow CNF&#8208;COF content of 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% endow an ASS Li metal battery with excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Here, we build a tunable multipolar conjugated polymer framework platform via pore wall chemistry to probe the role of electronic structure engineering in improving the Li+ conduction by theoretical studies. Guided by theoretical prediction, we develop a new cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked multipolar polymer framework namely CNF&#8208;COF, which can act as efficient ion sieves to modify solid polymer electrolytes to simultaneously tune Li+ migration and stable Li anodes for long&#8208;lifespan all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li metal batteries at high rate. The dual&#8208;decoration of cyano and fluorine groups in CNF&#8208;COF favorably regulates electronic structure via multipolar donor&#8208;acceptor electronic effects to afford proper energy band structure and abundant electron&#8208;rich sites for enhanced oxidative stability, facilitated ion&#8208;pair dissociation and suppressed anion movements. Thus, the CNF&#8208;COF incorporation into poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes not only renders fast selective Li+ transport but also facilitates the Li dendrite suppression. Specifically, the constructed PEO composite electrolyte with an ultra&#8208;low CNF&#8208;COF content of only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% is endowed with a wide electrochemical window, a high ionic conductivity of 0.634&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and a large Li+ transference number of 0.81&#8212;remarkably outperforming CNF&#8208;COF&#8208;free counterparts (0.183&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 0.22). As such, the Li symmetric cell delivers stable Li plating/stripping over 1400&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Impressively, by coupling with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, the assembled ASS Li battery under 60&#8201;&#176;C allows for stable cycling over 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and over 1000&#8197;cycles even at 2&#8197;C with a large capacity retention of ~75&#8201;%, surpassing most reported ASS Li batteries using PEO&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Elucidation of Palmarumycin Spirobisnaphthalene Biosynthesis Reveals a Set of Previously Unrecognized Oxidases and Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palmarumycins are a major type of fungal spirobisnaphthalenes that are biosynthesized by two distantly located biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) jointly. PalA, an unusual, multifunctional P450, catalyzes the dimerization of DHNs to form the unique spiroketal and 2,3&#8208;epoxy groups. PalB installs the 5&#8208;hydoxy group, while PalC functions as a 1&#8208;reductase/dehydrogenase and epoxide reductase. PalD catalyzes the 1&#8208;dehydrogenation to form 1&#8208;keto products.







Abstract
Spirobisnaphthalenes (SBNs) are a class of highly oxygenated, fungal bisnaphthalenes containing a unique spiroketal bridge, that displayed diverse bioactivities. Among the reported SBNs, palmarumycins are the major type, which are precursors for the other type of SBNs structurally. However, the biosynthesis of SBNs is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthesis of palmarumycins, using gene disruption, heterologous expression, and substrate feeding experiments. The biosynthetic gene cluster for palmarumycins was identified to be distant from the polyketide synthase gene cluster, and included two cytochrome P450s (PalA and PalB), and one short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PalC) encoding genes as key structural genes. PalA is an unusual, multifunctional P450 that catalyzes the oxidative dimerization of 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to generate the spiroketal linkage and 2,3&#8208;epoxy group. Chemical synthesis of key intermediate and in vitro biochemical assays proved that the oxidative dimerization proceeded via a binaphthyl ether. PalB installs the C&#8208;5 hydroxy group, widely found in SBNs. PalC catalyzes 1&#8208;keto reduction, the reverse 1&#8208;dehydrogenation, and 2,3&#8208;epoxide reduction. Moreover, an FAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, encoded by palD, which locates outside the cluster, functions as a 1&#8208;dehydrogenase. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical evidence for the biosynthesis of palmarumycin SBNs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Interlayer Spacings as Perfectly Selective Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired artificial proton channels that can sieving protons out of ions or water molecules with perfectly selectivity are constructed. The channels use the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups to sterically reject all atoms or molecules, while providing hydrogen bonding network for proton hopping.







Abstract
Biological proton channels have perfect selectivity in aqueous environment against almost all ions and molecules, a property that differs itself from other biological channels and a feature that remains challenging to realize for bulk artificial materials. The biological perfect selectivity originates from the fact that the channel has almost no free space for ion or water transport but generates a hydrogen bonded wire in the presence of protons to allow the proton hopping. Inspired by this, we used the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups as perfectly selective artificial proton channels. The interlayer spacings are so narrow that no atoms or molecules can diffuse through. However, protons exhibit a diffusivity in the same order of magnitude as that in bulk water. Density functional theory calculations show that water molecules and the COF material form hydrogen bonded wires, allowing the proton hopping. We further demonstrate that the proton transport rate can be tuned by adjusting the acidity of the functional groups.

         <title>Expanding the Hydrophobic Cavity Surface of Azocalix[4]arene to Enable Biotin/Avidin Affinity with Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene (Naph&#8208;SAC4A) has been developed that can achieve a biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin&#8208;level binding affinity (up to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 ) through its expanded hydrophobic surface. Naph&#8208;SAC4A demonstrated the sensitive recognition of rocuronium in serum and a hypoxia&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin with minimum leakage at the cellular level.







Abstract
The development of artificial receptors that combine ultrahigh&#8208;affinity binding and controllable release for active guests holds significant importance in biomedical applications. On one hand, a complex with an exceedingly high binding affinity can resist unwanted dissociation induced by dilution effect and complex interferents within physiological environments. On the other hand, stimulus&#8208;responsive release of the guest is essential for precisely activating its function. In this context, we expanded hydrophobic cavity surface of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene, affording Naph&#8208;SAC4A. This modification significantly enhanced its aqueous binding affinity to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1, akin to the naturally occurring strongest recognition pair, biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin. Consequently, Naph&#8208;SAC4A emerges as the first artificial receptor to simultaneously integrate ultrahigh recognition affinity and actively controllable release. The markedly enhanced affinity not only improved Naph&#8208;SAC4A&#8242;s sensitivity in detecting rocuronium bromide in serum, but also refined the precision of hypoxia&#8208;responsive doxorubicin delivery at the cellular level, demonstrating its immense potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Tandem Catalysts Enabling Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling toward the Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) exhibited excellent activity in the electrosynthesis of urea, in which the two types of active sites independently stabilized the key intermediates of *CONH2 in urea formation via tandem catalysis.







Abstract
The development of a methodology for synthesizing value&#8208;added urea (CO(NH2)2) via a renewable electricity&#8208;driven C&#8722;N coupling reaction under mild conditions is highly anticipated. However, the complex catalytic active sites that act on the carbon and nitrogen species make the reaction mechanism unclear, resulting in a low efficiency of C&#8722;N coupling from the co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). Herein, we propose a novel tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co), in which the Mo sites serve to facilitate nitrate reduction to the *NH2 intermediate, while the Co sites enhance CO2 reduction to carbonic oxide (CO), thus synergistically promoting C&#8722;N coupling. The synthesized Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) catalyst exhibited a noteworthy urea yield rate of 844.11&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, alongside a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 33.90&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By combining in situ spectroscopic techniques with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that efficient C&#8722;N coupling is attributed to a tandem system in which the *NH2 and *CO intermediates produced by the Mo and Co active sites of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) stabilize the formation of the *CONH2 intermediate. This study provides an effective avenue for the design and synthesis of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Strong Interactions between Au Nanoparticles and BiVO4 Photoanode Boosts Hole Extraction for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions between Au nanoparticles and BiVO4 supports are achieved under reductive treatment for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The electron&#8208;rich Au&#948;&#8722; could extract photogenerated holes and accelerate the charge separation. The encapsulation of VOx on Au surface enhances the *OH adsorption and the *OOH generation to promote the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely proposed as a key factor in tuning catalytic performances. Herein, the classical SMSI between Au nanoparticles (NPs) and BiVO4 (BVO) supports (Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI) is discovered and used innovatively for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Owing to the SMSI, the electrons transfer from V4+ to Au NPs, leading to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Au species (Au&#948;&#8722;) and strong electronic interaction (i.e., Au&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Ov&#8208;V4+), which readily contributes to extract photogenerated holes and promote charge separation. Benefitted from the SMSI effect, the as&#8208;prepared Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI photoanode exhibits a superior photocurrent density of 6.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode after the deposition of FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts. This work provides a pioneering view for extending SMSI effect to bimetal oxide supports for PEC water splitting, and guides the interfacial electronic and geometric structure modulation of photoanodes consisting of metal NPs and reducible oxides for improved solar energy conversion efficiency.

A kind of redox molecular junction sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework with multiple active sites have been prepared and can be successfully applied for light&#8208;assisted CO2 energy storage.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light sensitive and bi&#8208;functionally favored CO2 reduction (CRR)/evolution (CER) photocathode catalysts that can get rid of the utilization of ultraviolet light and improve sluggish kinetics is demanded to conquer the current technique&#8208;barrier of traditional Li&#8208;CO2 battery. Here, a kind of redox molecular junction sp2c metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF) has been prepared through the connection between Cu3 and BTDE and can serve as efficient photocathode catalyst in light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery. Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF with redox&#8208;ability, visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, electron&#8208;hole separation ability and endows the photocathode with excellent round&#8208;trip efficiency (95.2&#8201;%) and an ultralow voltage hysteresis (0.18&#8197;V), outperforming the Schiff base COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BTDA&#8208;COF and Cu3&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) and majority of the reported photocathode catalysts. Combined theoretical calculations with characterizations, Cu3&#8208;BTDE&#8208;COF with the integration of Cu3 centers, thiazole and cyano groups possess strong CO2 adsorption/activation and Li+ interaction/diffusion ability to boost the CRR/CER kinetics and related battery property.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Cyclization of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: New Access towards Azulenothiophenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of novel triene&#8208;yne systems, interesting azuleno[b]thiophenes and azuleno[c]thiophenes were synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra, CVs and DFT calculations were performed.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reactions. A five&#8208;membered ring as backbone in the applied triene&#8208;yne substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization mode necessary to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these the electronic properties were determined. Short two or three step sequences towards the applied starting materials make this approach synthetically highly attractive.

         <title>Structure and Internal Dynamics of Short RNA Duplexes Determined by a Combination of Pulsed EPR Methods and MD Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined orientation&#8208;selective PELDOR and 19F Mims ENDOR to characterize the structural ensemble of RNA duplexes and their internal motions. In a quantitative comparison to MD simulations of RNA with and without spin labels, we found that state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art force fields with explicit parameterization of the spin label can describe the conformational ensemble present in our experiments.







Abstract
We used EPR spectroscopy to characterize the structure of RNA duplexes and their internal twist, stretch and bending motions. We prepared eight 20&#8208;base&#8208;pair&#8208;long RNA duplexes containing the rigid spin&#8208;label &#199;m, a cytidine analogue, at two positions and acquired orientation&#8208;selective PELDOR/DEER data. By using different frequency bands (X&#8208;, Q&#8208;, G&#8208;band), detailed information about the distance and orientation of the labels was obtained and provided insights into the global conformational dynamics of the RNA duplex. We used 19F Mims ENDOR experiments on three singly &#199;m&#8208; and singly fluorine&#8208;labeled RNA duplexes to determine the exact position of the &#199;m spin label in the helix. In a quantitative comparison to MD simulations of RNA with and without &#199;m spin labels, we found that state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art force fields with explicit parameterization of the spin label were able to describe the conformational ensemble present in our experiments. The MD simulations further confirmed that the &#199;m spin labels are excellent mimics of cytidine inducing only small local changes in the RNA structure. &#199;m spin labels are thus ideally suited for high&#8208;precision EPR experiments to probe the structure and, in conjunction with MD simulations, motions of RNA.

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncoplanar polyaromatic amine, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB), was used as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes via interfacial polymerization. The resulting membrane exhibited a high salt/antibiotic selectivity and water permeance. The excellent antibiotic desalination performance can be maintained in industrial&#8208;scale spiral&#8208;wound module.







Abstract
Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27&#8197;nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0&#8197;m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Helicene Aromaticity Deviates from the Clar Rule&#8212;On the Electronic Dissimilarity of Large Isomeric Fibonacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long isomeric fibonacenes&#8212;a phenacene, a helicene and a croissant&#8208;shaped isomer&#8212;are found to show strikingly different absorption and emission spectra, despite their equivalent Kekul&#233; structures. Complementary computations based either on magnetic or electronic criteria for aromaticity indicate that in long helicenes, the Clar and Kekul&#233; rules of preferred sextet localization do not hold.







Abstract
This combined experimental and theoretical study illustrates the profound consequences of non&#8208;planarity on the electronic properties of polycyclic arenes. Three isomeric [10]fibonacene tetraesters were synthesized through a robust and regiocontrolled Perkin/Mallory approach: a nearly planar [10]phenacene derivative, a moderately twisted [10]semicircle derivative, and a 3D non&#8208;planar [10]helicene derivative. The photophysical properties of the 3D [10]helicene isomer were found to be dramatically different from the comparable ones of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers. The aromatic properties of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers conform well with their predictive Kekul&#233; and Clar analyses, but the [10]helicene isomer deviates from these general topological rules, which appears to be a general phenomenon for [n]fibonacenes with n&#8805;9.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Active Site Structure on the Conversion of Methane to Methanol in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modify activation conditions to stabilize different Cu&#8208;oxo and Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers in the zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Subsequently we combine theory and experiment to investigate how the Cu site structure impacts the conversion of methane to methanol. Our results indicate that site stoichiometry controls methanol production in a stepwise conversion process.







Abstract
In the past, Cu&#8208;oxo or &#8208;hydroxy clusters hosted in zeolites have been suggested to enable the selective conversion of methane to methanol, but the impact of the active site's stoichiometry and structure on methanol production is still poorly understood. Herein, we apply theoretical modeling in conjunction with experiments to study the impact of these two factors on partial methane oxidation in the Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Phase diagrams developed from first&#8208;principles suggest that Cu&#8208;hydroxy or Cu&#8208;oxo dimers are stabilized when O2 or N2O are used to activate the catalyst, respectively. We confirm these predictions experimentally and determine that in a stepwise conversion process, Cu&#8208;oxo dimers can convert twice as much methane to methanol compared to Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers. Our theoretical models rationalize how Cu&#8208;di&#8208;oxo dimers can convert up to two methane molecules to methanol, while Cu&#8208;di&#8208;hydroxyl dimers can convert only one methane molecule to methanol per catalytic cycle. These findings imply that in Cu clusters, at least one oxo group or two hydroxyl groups are needed to convert one methane molecule to methanol per cycle. This simple structure&#8211;activity relationship allows to intuitively understand the potential of small oxygenated or hydroxylated transition metal clusters to convert methane to methanol.

&lt;p&gt;We modify activation conditions to stabilize different Cu-oxo and Cu-hydroxyl dimers in the zeolite SSZ-13. Subsequently we combine theory and experiment to investigate how the Cu site structure impacts the conversion of methane to methanol. Our results indicate that site stoichiometry controls methanol production in a stepwise conversion process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Cu-oxo or -hydroxy clusters hosted in zeolites have been suggested to enable the selective conversion of methane to methanol, but the impact of the active site's stoichiometry and structure on methanol production is still poorly understood. Herein, we apply theoretical modeling in conjunction with experiments to study the impact of these two factors on partial methane oxidation in the Cu-exchanged zeolite SSZ-13. Phase diagrams developed from first-principles suggest that Cu-hydroxy or Cu-oxo dimers are stabilized when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are used to activate the catalyst, respectively. We confirm these predictions experimentally and determine that in a stepwise conversion process, Cu-oxo dimers can convert twice as much methane to methanol compared to Cu-hydroxyl dimers. Our theoretical models rationalize how Cu-di-oxo dimers can convert up to two methane molecules to methanol, while Cu-di-hydroxyl dimers can convert only one methane molecule to methanol per catalytic cycle. These findings imply that in Cu clusters, at least one oxo group or two hydroxyl groups are needed to convert one methane molecule to methanol per cycle. This simple structure&#8211;activity relationship allows to intuitively understand the potential of small oxygenated or hydroxylated transition metal clusters to convert methane to methanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implanting Colloidal Nanoparticles into Single&#8208;Crystalline Zeolites for Catalytic Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic zeolite with Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticles nucleus and single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites shell have been fabricated by a stepwise crystallization strategy. The resulting Fe3O4@HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst shows a high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for the dehydration of ethonal in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor.







Abstract
The encapsulation of functional colloidal nanoparticles (100&#8197;nm) into single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites, aiming to create uniform core&#8211;shell structures, is a highly sought&#8208;after yet formidable objective due to significant lattice mismatch and distinct crystallization properties. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a core&#8211;shell structured single&#8208;crystal zeolite encompassing an Fe3O4 colloidal core via a novel confinement stepwise crystallization methodology. By engineering a confined nanocavity, anchoring nucleation sites, and executing stepwise crystallization, we have successfully encapsulated colloidal nanoparticles (CN) within single&#8208;crystal zeolites. These grafted sites, alongside the controlled crystallization process, compel the zeolite seed to nucleate and expand along the Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticle surface, within a meticulously defined volume (1.5&#215;107&#8804;V&#8804;1.3&#215;108&#8197;nm3). Our strategy exhibits versatility and adaptability to an array of zeolites, including but not restricted to ZSM&#8208;5, NaA, ZSM&#8208;11, and TS&#8208;1 with polycrystalline zeolite shell. We highlight the uniformly structured magnetic&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;crystalline zeolite, which displays pronounced superparamagnetism (14&#8197;emu/g) and robust acidity (~0.83&#8197;mmol/g). This innovative material has been effectively utilized in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor for the dehydration of ethanol, delivering an exceptional conversion rate (98&#8201;%), supreme ethylene selectivity (98&#8201;%), and superior catalytic endurance (in excess of 100&#8197;hours).

         <title>Chloro&#8208;Functionalized Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ether&#8208;based electrolyte functionalized with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) enabled the formation of a dual halides&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby enhancing the cycling stability (6000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (4.3&#8197;V) performance, and wide temperature operation (&#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C) of potassium ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolyte is beneficial to obtaining good low&#8208;temperature performance and high ionic conductivity in potassium ion batteries. However, the dilute ether&#8208;based electrolytes usually result in ion&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation of graphite, poor cycling stability, and hard to withstand high voltage cathodes above 4.0&#8197;V. To address the aforementioned issues, an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) was introduced to regulate the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enhance the oxidative stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The dilute (~0.91&#8197;M) chloro&#8208;functionalized ether&#8208;based electrolyte not only facilitates the formation of homogeneous dual halides&#8208;based SEI, but also effectively suppress aluminum corrosion at high voltage. Using this functionalized electrolyte, the K||graphite cell exhibits a stability of 700&#8197;cycles, the K||Prussian blue (PB) cell (4.3&#8197;V) delivers a stability of 500&#8197;cycles, and the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell reveals a long stability of 6000&#8197;cycles with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#8201;%. Additionally, the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell can operate under a wide temperature range from &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the positive impact of electrolyte functionalization on the electrochemical performance, providing a bright future of ether&#8208;based electrolytes application for long&#8208;lasting, wide&#8208;temperature, and high Coulombic efficiency PIBs and beyond.

         <title>Light Induced Proton Coupled Charge Transfer Triggers Counterion Directional Translocation</title>

The light&#8208;triggered translocation of ClO4&#8722; anion from cationic to neutral&#8208;binding site along BPym&#8208;OH dye is visualized by emission. The combination of time&#8208;resolved fluorescence and molecular dynamic simulation allows its description in time and energy domains. This reaction generates dramatically red&#8208;shifted fluorescence extending to near&#8208;IR that appears at ~83&#8197;ps, resulting from electrochromic modulation of coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer.







Abstract
We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4&#8722; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym&#8208;OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited&#8208;state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion. The associated with ion translocation red&#8208;shifted fluorescence band (at 750&#8197;nm, extending to near&#8208;IR region) appears at the time ~83&#8197;ps as a result of electrochromic modulation of PCCT reaction. It occurs at substantial delay to PCCT that displayed fluorescence band at 640&#8197;nm and risetime of &lt;200&#8197;fs. Thus, it becomes possible to visualize the manifestations of light&#8208;triggered ion translocation and of its driving force by fluorescence techniques and to separate them in time and energy domains.

The sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 realizes 1,3&#8208;butadiene purification from complex C4 mixtures via synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and thermodynamic mechanisms, and polymer&#8208;grade C4H6 (99.5&#8201;%) is obtained via a single adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Porous materials that could recognize specific molecules from complex mixtures are of great potential in improving the current energy&#8208;intensive multistep separation processes. However, due to the highly similar structures and properties of the mixtures, the design of desired porous materials remains challenging. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 with suitable pore size and pore chemistry is designed for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) purification from complex C4 mixtures. The sulfonate anions decorated in the channel achieve selective recognition of C4H6 from other C4 olefins with subtle polarity differences through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;S interactions, affording recorded C4H6/trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 selectivity (4.4). Meanwhile, the shrunken mouth of the channel with a suitable pore size (4.6&#8197;&#197;) exhibits exclusion effect to the larger molecules cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8, iso&#8208;C4H8, n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10. Benefiting from the moderate C4 olefins binding affinity exhibited by sulfonate anions, the adsorbed C4H6 could be easily regenerated near ambient conditions. Polymer&#8208;grade 1,3&#8208;butadiene (99.5&#8201;%) is firstly obtained from 7&#8208;component C4 mixtures via one adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. The work demonstrates the great potential of synergistic recognition of size&#8208;sieving and thermodynamically equilibrium in dealing with complex mixtures.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Formation of Silver Nanoclusters and Their Transformation to the Same Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanoclusters (Ag54 and Ag33) with different stabilities were isolated from identical reactants under different temperatures. Upon stimulation with bpbenz (bpbenz=1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene), the kinetically metastable Ag54 and the thermodynamically stable Ag33 can yield the same product of Ag31via the breakage&#8208;reorganization and ligand exchange transformation mechanism, respectively.







Abstract
Herein, two atomically precise silver nanoclusters, Ag54 and Ag33, directed by inner anion templates (CrO42&#8722; and/or Cl&#8722;), are initially isolated as a mixed phase from identical reactants across a wide temperature range (20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Interestingly, fine&#8208;tuning the reaction temperature can realize pure phase synthesis of the two nanoclusters; that is, a metastable Ag54 is kinetically formed at a low temperature (20&#8201;&#176;C), whereas such a system is steered towards a thermodynamically stable Ag33 at a relatively high temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry illustrates that the stability of Ag33 is superior to that of Ag54, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the difference in structural stability can influence the pathway of 1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene induced transformation reaction starting from Ag54 and Ag33. The former undergoes a dramatic breakage&#8208;reorganization process to form an Ag31 dimer (Ag31), while the same product can be also achieved from the latter following a noninvasive ligand exchange process. Both the Ag54 and Ag33 have the potential for further remote laser ignition applications. This work not only demonstrates how temperature controls the isolation of a specific phase, but also sheds light on the structural transformation pathway of nanoclusters with different stability.

         <title>Monolithic Interphase Enables Fast Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Subzero Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a monolithic and amorphous electrode/electrolyte interphase at low temperature which is thin, stable, and contains more organic components, facilitating fast Na+ kinetics, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve long&#8208;term cycling performance and great rate capability at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
In spite of the competitive performance at room temperature, the development of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) is still hindered by sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase under subzero environments. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, consisting of 0.5M NaPF6 dissolving in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether solvent, is proposed for SIBs working at low temperature. Such an electrolyte generates a thin, amorphous, and homogeneous cathode/electrolyte interphase at low temperature. The interphase is monolithic and rich in organic components, reducing the limitation of Na+ migration through inorganic crystals, thereby facilitating the interfacial Na+ dynamics at low temperature. Furthermore, it effectively blocks the unfavorable side reactions between active materials and electrolytes, improving the structural stability. Consequently, Na0.7Li0.03Mg0.03Ni0.27Mn0.6Ti0.07O2//Na and hard carbon//Na cells deliver a high capacity retention of 90.8&#8201;% after 900 cycles at 1C, a capacity over 310&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, showing long&#8208;term cycling stability and great rate capability at low temperature.

         <title>Tunable Narrow&#8208;Band Cyan&#8208;Emission of Eu2+&#8208;doped Nitridomagnesophosphates Ba3&#8722;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;3)</title>

         <dc:description>
We present the first solid solution series of the new class of nitridomagnesophosphates with excellent luminescence properties in the cyan spectral range, tunable by Ba/Sr ratio. Extensive investigations have made it possible to attribute the luminescence to the doping of one crystallographic site. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network for the first time.







Abstract
Tetrahedron&#8208;based nitrides offer a wide range of properties and applications. Highly condensed nitridophosphates are examples of nitrides that exhibit fascinating luminescence properties when doped with Eu2+, making them appealing for industrial applications. Here, we present the first nitridomagnesophosphate solid solution series Ba3&#8722;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;3), synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (3&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C). Starting from the binary nitrides P3N5 and Mg3N2 and the respective alkaline earth azides, we incorporate Mg into the P/N framework to increase the degree of condensation &#954; to 0.6, the highest observed value for alkaline earth nitridophosphates. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and solid&#8208;state NMR. DFT calculations were performed on the title compounds and other related highly condensed nitridophosphates to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of the solid solution series show a tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from cyan to green (492&#8211;515&#8197;nm), which is attributed to the preferred doping of a single crystallographic site. Experimental confirmation of this assumption was provided by overdoping experiments and STEM&#8208;HAADF studies on the series as well on the stoichiometric compound Ba2Eu[Mg2P10N20] with additional atomic resolution energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping.

         <title>Control of Polarity in Kagome&#8208;NiAs Bismuthides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered octahedral site vacancies and filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites by transition metals stabilizes a 2&#215;2&#215;1 P63/mmc superstructure of NiAs with kagome nets in Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. Further ordering of the interstitial sites via composition generates a net polarization in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi with polar Fmm2 symmetry. The control of polarity is reflected in electronic transport properties.







Abstract
A 2&#215;2&#215;1 superstructure of the P63/mmc NiAs structure is reported in which kagome nets are stabilized in the octahedral transition metal layers of the compounds Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. The ordered vacancies that yield the true hexagonal kagome motif lead to filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites with the transition metal in this family of &#8220;kagome&#8208;NiAs&#8221; type materials. Further ordering of vacancies within these interstitial layers can be compositionally driven to simultaneously yield kagome&#8208;connected layers and a net polarization along the c axes in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi, which adopt Fmm2 symmetry. The polar and non&#8208;polar materials exhibit different electronic transport behaviour, reflecting the tuneability of both structure and properties within the NiAs&#8208;type bismuthide materials family.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Ketones Using CO2 as a CO Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an electrocatalytic cascade method for synthesizing ketones using CO2 as a CO surrogate. By employing a synergistic combination of two earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts, high yields are achieved in a simple setup, demonstrating the potential for sustainable and efficient carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
The construction of carbonyl compounds via carbonylation reactions using safe CO sources remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to synthetic chemists. Herein, we propose a catalyst cascade Scheme in which CO2 is used as a CO surrogate in the carbonylation of benzyl chlorides. Our approach is based on the cooperation between two coexisting catalytic cycles: the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction cycle promoted by [Fe(TPP)Cl] (TPP=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin) and an electrochemical carbonylation cycle catalyzed by [Ni(bpy)Br2] (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). As a proof of concept, this protocol allows for the synthesis of symmetric ketones from good to excellent yields in an undivided cell with non&#8208;sacrificial electrodes. The reaction can be directly scaled up to gram&#8208;scale and operates effectively at a CO2 concentration of 10&#8201;%, demonstrating its robustness. Our mechanistic studies based on cyclic voltammetry, IR spectroelectrochemistry and Density Functional Theory calculations suggest a synergistic effect between the two catalysts. The CO produced from CO2 reduction is key in the formation of the [Ni(bpy)(CO)2], which is proposed as the catalytic intermediate responsible for the C&#8722;C bond formation in the carbonylation steps.

         <title>Cage&#8208;To&#8208;Cage Transformations in Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Cages Using &#8220;Acid/Base&#8221; or &#8220;Guest Binding&#8208;Induced Strain&#8221; as Stimuli</title>

         <dc:description>
A pair of acid/base responsive cages that can be interconverted without affecting the coordination environment have been self&#8208;assembled from 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based ligands, leading to a three&#8208;state supramolecular switch that can be controlled through strong acid/bases. A guest&#8208;binding&#8208;induced strain&#8208;triggered cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation was found, in addition to chemical stimuli (acid/base, NH3) responsive cage transformations.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular systems between different functional forms by utilizing acids/bases as stimuli is a formidable challenge, especially where labile coordination bonds are involved. A pair of acid/base responsive, interconvertible 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based Pd2L4&#8208;type cages are prepared that exhibit differential guest binding abilities towards disulfonates of varied sizes. A three&#8208;state switch has been achieved, where (i) a weakly coordinating base induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation in the first step, (ii) a strongly coordinating base triggered cage disassembly as the second step, and (iii) the third step shows acid(strong) promoted generation of initial cage, thereby completing the cycle. To our surprise, binding of a specific disulfonate guest facilitated cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations by inducing strain on the cage assembly thereby opening the labile pyrylium rings of the cage. Through a competitive guest binding study, we demonstrated the superior guest binding capability of the octacationic pyrylium&#8208;based cage over a similar&#8208;sized tetracationic cage. These results provide a reliable approach to reversibly modulate the guest binding properties of acid/base&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled coordination cages.

         <title>Nanogels with Metal&#8208;Organic Cages as Functional Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;organic cages with acrylamide side chains were incorporated in N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;based nanogels by precipitation polymerization. Due to the presence of cage crosslinks, the resulting nanogels can be used as specific sorbents for chloride ions.







Abstract
A dinuclear metal&#8208;organic cage with four acrylate side chains was prepared by self&#8208;assembly. Precipitation polymerization of the cage with N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide yielded a thermoresponsive nanogel. The host properties of the cage were retained within the gel matrix, endowing the nanogel with the capability to serve as a sorbent for chloride ions in water. Moreover, a heteroleptic cage with the drug abiraterone as co&#8208;ligand was integrated into a nanogel. The addition of chloride ions induced a structural rearrangement of the metal&#8208;ligand assembly, resulting in the gradual release of abiraterone.

A series of anhydride&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (i.e., PI&#8208;DP&#8208;COF and PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) with specifically designed zigzag hopping sites and zincophilic anhydride groups that can serve as desired platforms to investigate the related Zn2+ hopping/transfer, dendrite&#8208;inhibition, and plating/stripping behaviours as well as the interfacial interaction.







Abstract
Precise design and tuning of Zn hopping/transfer sites with deeper understanding of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective coating for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, we probe into the role of anode&#8208;coating interfaces by designing a series of anhydride&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (i.e., PI&#8208;DP&#8208;COF and PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) with specifically designed zigzag hopping sites and zincophilic anhydride groups that can serve as desired platforms to investigate the related Zn2+ hopping/transfer behaviours as well as the interfacial interaction. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the ABC stacking models of these COFs endow the structures with specific zigzag sites along the 1D channel that can accelerate Zn2+ transfer kinetics, lower surface&#8208;energy, homogenize ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed. Attributed to these superiorities, thus&#8208;obtained optimal PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF cells offer excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetric&#8208;cell (2000&#8197;cycles at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and full&#8208;cell (1600&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), outperforming almost all the reported porous crystalline materials.

         <title>Accumulation, Characterization and Reactivity of Chiral Ammonium&#8208;Carboxonium Dications in Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ammonium&#8208;oxocarbenium dications are accumulated in superacid through a tandem diastereoselective proton&#8208;transfer/intramolecular cyclization. Their reactivity in the diastereoselective remote functionalization of non&#8208;activated alkene is explored.







Abstract
The accumulation of chiral ammonium&#8208;oxocarbenium dications in superacid is evidenced by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and confirmed by DFT calculations. Its potential for the diastereoselective remote hydrofunctionalization of non&#8208;activated alkene is also explored.

         <title>Aqueous Coordination&#8208;Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single&#8208;component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.







Abstract
Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. Herein, we develop well&#8208;behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29&#8197;mol&#8201;%) in a single&#8208;component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE).

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered J&#8208;Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Therapy Conversion: from Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy to Long&#8208;Lasting Chemodynamic Therapy for Effective Tumor Ablation</title>

A light&#8208;triggered J&#8208;aggregates system is developed for a converting cancer therapy with enhanced therapeutic outcomes. The photodegradation of cyanine leads to the destruction of J&#8208;aggregation, facilitating the conversion from photodynamic/photothermal therapy to long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy. This work presents a safe and effective strategy for prolonging the therapeutic efficacy of ROS&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have become an effective tool for tumor treatment. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) takes advantage of various ROS and enhances therapeutic effects. However, the activation of CDT usually occurs before PDT, which hinders the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and reduces the treatment efficiency. Herein, we present a light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;system based on molecular aggregation regulation for converting cancer therapy from PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) to a long&#8208;lasting CDT. The ordered J&#8208;aggregation enhances the photodynamic properties of the cyanine moiety while simultaneously suppressing the chemodynamic capabilities of the copper&#8208;porphyrin moiety. Upon light irradiation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs demonstrate strong photodynamic and photothermal effects. Meanwhile, light triggers a rapid degradation of the cyanine backbone, leading to the destruction of the J&#8208;aggregation. As a result, a long&#8208;lasting CDT is sequentially activated, and the sustained generation of &#8901;OH is observed for up to 48&#8197;hours, causing potent cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Due to their excellent tumor accumulation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs exhibit effective in vivo tumor ablation through the converting therapy. This work provides a new approach for effectively prolonging the chemodynamic activity in ROS&#8208;based cancer therapy.

A fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) has been designed and fabricated for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously even at practical conditions. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) has been hindered by limited cycle&#8208;life and safety concerns. To solve these problems, we develop a novel fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linker for gel polymer electrolyte in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. The fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) by in&#8208;situ polymerization method not only demonstrates high oxidation stability but also exhibits excellent compatibility with lithium metal anode. LMBs utilizing FP&#8208;GPE realize stable cycling even at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (vs Li/Li+) with various high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2|FP&#8208;GPE|Li battery exhibits an ultralong cycle&#8208;life of 1200 cycles with an impressive capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;%. Furthermore, the FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance even at practical conditions, such as high cathode mass loading (20.84&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultrathin Li (20&#8197;&#956;m), and a wide temperature range of &#8722;25 to 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse. Additionally, the industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical LiMn2O4|FP&#8208;GPE|Li4Ti5O12 cells demonstrate a remarkable cycle&#8208;life of 1400 cycles. Therefore, the impressive electrochemical performance and high safety in practical batteries demonstrate a substantial potential of well&#8208;designed FP&#8208;GPE for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Phenol Derivatives over Bismuth&#8208;Based Porous Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous bismuth&#8208;based metal halide perovskites with tunable band gap compositions are prepared and explored as photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O coupling reactions. The porous morphology, appropriate band&#8208;edge alignment and Lewis acid sites of CsBi2Br9 are found to play a crucial role in stabilizing the phenolic intermediates, thereby boosting the reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The selective oxidative coupling of phenol derivatives, involving carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond formation, has emerged as a critical approach in the synthesis of natural products. However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X=Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored band gaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73&#8201;% selectivity for C&#8722;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8722;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.

         <title>Mercury&#8208;Group&#8197;13 Metal Covalent Bonds: A Systematic Comparison of Aluminyl, Gallyl and Indyl Metallo&#8208;ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Aided by the syntheses of potassium indyl reagents, access is possible for the first time to a complete series of metal&#8208;trielyl complexes featuring the same xanthene&#8208;derived NON&#8208;framework. Analysis of mercury compounds of the type (boryl)HgE(NON) (E=Al, Ga, In) by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical methods shows that the aluminyl metallo&#8208;ligand [(NON)Al]&#8722; is the most potent &#963;&#8208;donor.







Abstract
Bimetallic compounds containing direct metal&#8208;group&#8197;13 element bonds have been shown to display unprecedented patterns of cooperative reactivity towards small molecules, which can be influenced by the identity of the group&#8197;13 element. In this context, we present here a systematic appraisal of group&#8197;13 metallo&#8208;ligands of the type [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) for E=Al, Ga and In, through a comparison of structural and spectroscopic parameters associated with the trans L or X ligands in linear d10 complexes of the types LM{E(NON)} and XM&#8242;{E(NON)}. These studies are facilitated by convenient syntheses (from the In(I) precursor, InCp) of the potassium indyl species [{K(NON)In}&#8901;KCp]n (1) and [(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2K2Cp] [(NON)In] (1&#8242;), and lead to the first structural characterisation of Ag&#8722;In and Hg&#8722;E (E=Al, In) covalent bonds. The resulting structural, spectroscopic and quantum chemical probes of Ag/Hg complexes are consistent with markedly stronger &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities of the aluminyl ligand, [(NON)Al]&#8722;, over its gallium and indium counterparts.

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Pyridyl&#8208;Imine Structures for Boosting Photocatalytic H2O2 Production via One&#8208;Step 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
The work reports a pyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) functionalized with pyridyl&#8208;imine structures to boost photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The unique pyridyl&#8208;imine structures can effectively suppress the two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process on imine&#8208;nitrogen sites, facilitating a more efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; pathway for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising contenders for the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the presence of imine nitrogen alters the mode of H2O2 generation from an efficient one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) route to a two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction pathway. In this work, we introduce 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine units into imine&#8208;based COF skeletons, creating a pyridyl&#8208;imine structure with two adjacent nitrogen atoms between the pyridine ring and imine linkage. This unique bipyridine&#8208;like architecture can effectively suppress the two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR process at the single imine&#8208;nitrogen site, facilitating a more efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; pathway. Consequently, the optimized pyridyl&#8208;imine COF (PyIm&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of up to 5850&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly double that of pristine bipyridine COFs. This work provides valuable insight into the rational design of functionalized COFs for enhanced H2O2 production in photocatalysis.

The aprotic acetone&#8208;mediated five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediate as the active site for the epoxidation reaction over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system is observed for the first time by using in situ and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The critical role of this intermediate in cyclohexene epoxidation is revealed.







Abstract
Solvent effects in catalytic reactions have received widespread attention as they can promote reaction rates and product selectivities by orders of magnitude. It is well accepted that the stable five&#8208;membered cyclic intermediates formed between the solvent molecules and Ti species are crucial to the alkene epoxidation in a heterogeneous Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system. However, the direct spectroscopic evidence of these intermediates is still missing and the corresponding reaction pathway for the alkene epoxidation remains unclear. By combining in situ 13C MAS NMR, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 1H&#8722;13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the five&#8208;membered ring structures, where the protic solvents (ROH), and aprotic solvent (acetone), coordinate and stabilize the active Ti species, are identified for the first time over Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system. Moreover, the role of these cyclic intermediates in the alkene epoxidation/hydration conversion is clarified. These results provide new insights into the solvent effect in liquid&#8208;phase epoxidation/hydration reactions over Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system.

         <title>Validating &#916;&#916;G Selectivity Descriptor for Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
While descriptor&#8208;based analysis has effectively delineated activity trends, addressing selectivity trends has proven to be a challenging hurdle in the quest to develop innovative catalysts for electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide via 2e&#8208;ORR. This contribution validates the efficacy of a novel selectivity descriptor, &#916;&#916;G, using an extensive library of binary alloys. We demonstrate &#916;&#916;G as the ultimate selectivity descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR.







Abstract
Understanding selectivity trends is a crucial hurdle in the developing innovative catalysts for generating hydrogen peroxide through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR). The identification of selectivity patterns has been made more accessible through the introduction of a newly developed selectivity descriptor derived from thermodynamics, denoted as &#916;&#916;G introduced in Chem Catal. 2023, 3(3), 100568. To validate the suitability of this parameter as a descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity, we utilize an extensive library of 155&#8197;binary alloys. We validate that &#916;&#916;G reliably depicts the selectivity trends in binary alloys reported for their high activity in the 2e&#8208;ORR. This analysis also enables the identification of nine selective 2e&#8208;ORR catalysts underscoring the efficacy of &#916;&#916;G as 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity descriptor. This work highlights the significance of concurrently considering both selectivity and activity trends. This holistic approach is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding in the identification of high&#8208;performance catalyst materials for optimal efficiency in various applications.

         <title>CO Intermediate&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Cu Sintering During Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts</title>

A novel pathway involving the evolution of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties driven by the synergistic adsorption of CO and H was identified for dynamic Cu sintering in Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts under CO2 reduction conditions.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.

         <title>Unveiling Low Temperature Assembly of Dense Fe&#8208;N4 Active Sites via Hydrogenation in Advanced Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>

&#8220;Innovative low&#8208;temp synthesis of single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts prevents Fe nanoparticles sintering, ensuring dense Fe&#8208;N4 site formation, and leads to improved ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency, with potential for diverse high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials.&#8221;







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe&#8208;N4 site without the Fe nanoparticles (NPs) sintering during the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis via high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dichlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe&#8208;N4 site formation without Fe NPs clustering at as low as 360&#8201;&#176;C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe&#8208;N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe&#8208;N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behaviour of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C material. The FeNC&#8208;H2&#8208;360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high&#8208;performance M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials (M=Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single&#8208;atom loadings.

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>

Light touch: A photosensitive copolymer made from elemental sulfur and low&#8208;cost dienes such as cyclopentadiene could be rapidly modified with low&#8208;power lasers operating in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Erasable information coding and direct laser lithography were demonstrated.







Abstract
The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786&#8197;nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light touch&lt;/b&gt;: A photosensitive copolymer made from elemental sulfur and low-cost dienes such as cyclopentadiene could be rapidly modified with low-power lasers operating in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Erasable information coding and direct laser lithography were demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano-, bio- and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low-cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low-power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786&#8197;nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unlocked birdcage symbolizes the material opening its spin gates, with the liberated bird representing charges. By unlocking the spin gates, the movement of charges becomes smooth and unrestricted, corresponding to the enhanced dynamics and stability of transition metal oxides during energy storage processes.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these &#8242;spin gates&#8242; occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8722;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 38&#8201;% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in a Porous Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, i.e., 6&#8208;nitro&#8208;spiropyran and o&#8208;fluoroazobenzene are shown to operate in a wavelength&#8208;orthogonal manner both in solution and when integrated into a porous material scaffold. Selective isomerization of each photoswitch can be triggered by a specific wavelength of light giving rise to four independently accessible states of the porous material, thus providing a basis for the dynamic multifunctional materials.







Abstract
The development of photoresponsive systems with non&#8208;invasive orthogonal control by distinct wavelengths of light is still in its infancy. In particular, the design of photochemically triggered&#8208;orthogonal systems integrated into solid materials that enable multiple dynamic control over their properties remains a longstanding challenge. Here, we report the orthogonal and reversible control of two types of photoswitches in an integrated solid porous framework, that is, visible&#8208;light responsive o&#8208;fluoroazobenzene and nitro&#8208;spiropyran motifs. The properties of the constructed material can be selectively controlled by different wavelengths of light thus generating four distinct states providing a basis for dynamic multifunctional materials. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the selective transformation of the azobenzene switch in the bulk, which in turn modulates N2 and CO2 adsorption.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Titanium on Mesoporous Nitrogen, Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Photo&#8208;thermal Catalytic CO2 Cycloaddition by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ti&#8722;CNO catalysts are synthesized for photothermal catalytic cycloaddition of styrene oxide and CO2 to styrene carbonate, achieving an excellent catalytic performance (98.3&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h, 10&#8197;cycles). The addition of Ti single atoms creates abundant mesoporous structure, enhances photothermal effect and Lewis acidic/basic sites, which facilitate the activation of styrene oxide and CO2 to form styrene oxide.+ and CO2.&#8722;, respectively.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for CO2 fixation to high value&#8208;added chemicals is meaningful but challenging. Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value&#8208;added process, we introduce earth&#8208;abundant Ti single&#8208;atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Ti&#8722;CNO) by a two&#8208;step method. The Ti&#8722;CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti&#8722;CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3&#8201;%, much higher than CN (27.1&#8201;%). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide&#8901;+ and CO2&#8901;&#8722; radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Ti&#948;+) and basic sites of Ti&#8722;CNO under light irradiation, respectively. This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for photo&#8208;thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.

         <title>The Importance of Sintering&#8208;Induced Grain Boundaries in Copper Catalysis to Improve Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syngas conversion reaction induces the in situ generation of copper grain boundaries which leads to the formation of long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The synergy of grain boundaries and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets leads to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrates to grain boundaries and inserts into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.







Abstract
Syngas conversion serves as a gas&#8208;to&#8208;liquid technology to produce liquid fuels and valuable chemicals from coal, natural gas, or biomass. During syngas conversion, sintering is known to deactivate the catalyst owing to the loss of active surface area. However, the growth of nanoparticles might induce the formation of new active sites such as grain boundaries (GBs) which perform differently from the original nanoparticles. Herein, we reported a unique Cu&#8208;based catalyst, Cu nanoparticles with in situ generated GBs confined in zeolite Y (denoted as activated Cu/Y), which exhibited a high selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons (65.3&#8197;C%) during syngas conversion. Such high selectivity for long&#8208;chain products distinguished activated Cu/Y from typical copper&#8208;based catalysts which mainly catalyze methanol synthesis. This unique performance was attributed to the GBs, while the zeolite assisted the stabilization through spatial confinement. Specifically, the GBs enabled H&#8208;assisted dissociation of CO and subsequent hydrogenation into CHx*. CHx* species not only serve as the initiator but also directly polymerize on Cu GBs, known as the carbide mechanism. Meanwhile, the synergy of GBs and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets led to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrated to GBs and inserted into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Carbaporphyrinoids Consisting of an Acyclic N&#8208;Confused Tetrapyrrole Analogue Served as Stable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Dyes</title>

Breaking the tetrapyrrolic &#960;&#8208;skeleton and implementing N&#8208;confusion modification offer a distinctive ligand platform for metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species. Through d&#8208;&#960; orbital interaction, the resultant open&#8208;ring Pd/Pt complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II absorption capability and high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis of novel pseudo&#8208;metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species (1M: M=Pd and Pt) achieved through the inner coordination of palladium(II) and platinum(II) with an acyclic N&#8208;confused tetrapyrrin analogue. Despite their tetrapyrrole frameworks being small, akin to well&#8208;known porphyrins, these species exhibit an unusually narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in an unprecedentedly low&#8208;energy absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed unique d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structures involving the metal d&#960;&#8208;ligand p&#960; hybridized molecular orbitals of 1M. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy confirmed distinct electronic structures. Remarkably, the complexes feature an open&#8208;metal coordination site in the peripheral NN dipyrrin site, forming hetero&#8208;metal complexes (1Pd&#8208;BF2 and 1Pt&#8208;BF2) through boron difluoride complexation. The resulting hetero metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species displayed further redshifted NIR&#8208;II absorption, highly efficient photothermal conversion efficiencies (&#951;; 62&#8211;65&#8201;%), and exceptional photostability. Despite the challenges associated with the theoretical and experimental assessment of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated metalla&#8208;aromaticity in relatively larger (more than 18&#960; electrons) polycyclic ring systems, these organometallic planar tetrapyrrole systems could serve as potential molecular platforms for aromaticity&#8208;relevant NIR&#8208;II dyes.

         <title>Structural Insights Into the Terpene Cyclization Domains of Two Fungal Sesterterpene Synthases and Enzymatic Engineering for Sesterterpene Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal sesterterpene synthases (NfSS and PbSS) were determined. Modeling of carbocationic intermediates, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds.







Abstract
Little is known about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of sesterterpene synthases (StTSs), which greatly hinders the structure&#8208;based engineering of StTSs for structural diversity expansion of sesterterpenes. We here report on the crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal StTSs: sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) and sesterbrasiliatriene synthase (PbSS). Both TC structures contain benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTAC), pyrophosphate (PPi), and magnesium ions (Mg2+), clearly defining the catalytic active sites. A combination of theory and experiments including carbocationic intermediates modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into the structural basis for their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.

         <title>CYP3A Mediates an Unusual C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage via Ipso&#8208;Addition of Oxygen in Drug Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave C&#8722;C bonds. Here we report the mechanisms of two unusual CYP3A&#8208;mediated cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the metabolism of tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib. One bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of activated oxygen, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site.







Abstract
Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds and the mechanisms of such cleavages are largely unknown. We identified two unusual cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the FDA&#8208;approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib that are mediated by CYP3A4/5, the major human phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Using a synthetic ketone, we rule out the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation mechanism that is commonly invoked to address P450&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavages. Our studies in 18O2 and H218O enriched systems reveal two unusual distinct mechanisms of C&#8722;C bond cleavage: one bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen to a C(sp2) site of N&#8208;protected pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site. This is the first report of CYP3A&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage in drug metabolism via ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen mediated mechanism. CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition is also implicated in the regioselective C&#8722;C cleavages of several pexidartinib analogs. The regiospecificity of CYP3A&#8208;catalyzed oxygen ipso&#8208;addition under environmentally friendly conditions may be attractive and inspire biomimetic or P450&#8208;engineering methods to address the challenging task of C&#8722;C bond cleavages.

         <title>Finding Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal Surfaces for Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) are found on the stable wurtzite crystal surfaces. All the surface atoms serving as Lewis acid/base sites contribute to the surface density of SFLPs reaching up to the highest value to date. The approaching orbital orientations of SFLPs are the origin of the outstanding performance for the activation of small molecules, thereby demonstrating great potential in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26&#215;1014&#8197;cm&#8722;2. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H2O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;Performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After high&#8208;voltage CV scanning, the higher (de)intercalation voltage and lower diffusion activation energy for both Cl&#8722; and K+ boost the comprehensive improvement of the discharge voltage, capacity, rate and cyclic performance. The comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs.







Abstract
The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8722;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Pyroelectric Property Accompanied by Spin Crossover in a Single Crystal of Fe(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;crossover Fe(II) complex demonstrating high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a remarkably wide temperature range just above room temperature was reported. Detailed structural analyses revealed that pyroelectric response can be ascribed to a giant thermal expansion of polar axis accompanied by a gradual low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin transition of metal centers.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials hold significant potential for energy harvesting, sensing, and imaging applications. However, achieving high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a wide temperature range near room temperature remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a single crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover compound shows remarkable pyroelectric properties accompanied by a thermally controlled spin transition. In this material, the uniaxial alignment of polar molecules results in a polarization of the lattice. As the molecular geometry is modulated during a gradual spin transition, the polar axis experiences a colossal thermal expansion with a coefficient of 796&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;K&#8722;1. Consequently, the material's polarization undergoes significant modulation as a secondary pyroelectric effect. The considerable shift in polarization (pyroelectric coefficient, p=3.7&#8211;22&#8197;nC&#8201;K&#8722;1cm&#8722;2), coupled with a low dielectric constant (&#1013;&#8242;=4.4&#8211;5.4) over a remarkably wide temperature range of 298 to 400&#8197;K, suggests this material is a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric. The demonstration of pyroelectricity combined with magnetic switching in this study will inspire further investigations in the field of molecular electronics and magnetism.

         <title>Adaptive and Robust Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs showcase enhanced mechanical performance.







Abstract
Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8208;ester networks. Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.

A 9&#8208;membered ring is incorporated into a saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;skeleton: In their Research Article (e202402756), Qian Miao et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of trioxa[9]circulene through intramolecular oxidative coupling of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene. In the crystals, molecules of trioxa[9]circulene stack in a column with remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, resembling the stacking pattern of saddle&#8208;shaped potato chips. Dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene exhibits high absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2.

The states A and B represented by guest&#8208;bound Pd2L4&#8208;type coordination cages are interconvertible upon addition of suitable base/acid. These two states are displayed on the cover against the background of Kashmir Tulip garden.

         <title>Molecular Ratchets and Kinetic Asymmetry: Giving Chemistry Direction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratcheting is the mechanism by which stochastic molecular dynamics, and other random exchange processes in chemistry, can be directionally biased and driven away from equilibrium. In this Review we discuss the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets and kinetic asymmetry, which underpins it. We explain the design principles for different types of ratchet and energy sources, and outline some current challenges and opportunities for the future.







Abstract
Over the last two decades ratchet mechanisms have transformed the understanding and design of stochastic molecular systems&#8212;biological, chemical and physical&#8212;in a move away from the mechanical macroscopic analogies that dominated thinking regarding molecular dynamics in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. pistons, springs, etc), to the more scale&#8208;relevant concepts that underpin out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium research in the molecular sciences today. Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules &#8216;walk&#8217; and track&#8208;based synthesisers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts (both motor proteins and synthetic catalysts), and how dynamic systems can be driven away from equilibrium through catalysis. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, the origin of life, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, the key feature of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms in endergonic chemical processes in biology, and their significance for behaviour and function from systems to synthesis, it is surely just as fundamentally important. This Review charts the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets, focussing particularly on the role for which they were originally envisaged in chemistry, as design elements for molecular machinery. Different kinetically asymmetric systems are compared, and the consequences of their dynamic behaviour discussed. These archetypal examples demonstrate how chemical systems can be driven inexorably away from equilibrium, rather than relax towards it.

         <title>Rational Design of Local Reaction Environment for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 into Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment near the catalyst surface, including local pH, the choice of the species of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, also acts as an effective approach for further improving the catalytic performance of CO2 reduction to valuable multicarbon products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products provides an attractive route for storing intermittent renewable electricity as fuels and feedstocks with high energy densities. Although substantial progress has been made in selective electrosynthesis of C2+ products via engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment in the vicinity of catalyst surface also acts as an effective approach for further enhancing the performance. Here, we discuss recent advances and pertinent challenges in the modulation of local reaction environment, encompassing local pH, the choice of the species and concentrations of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, for achieving high C2+ selectivity. In addition, mechanistic understanding in the effects of the local reaction environment is also discussed. Particularly, the important progress extracted from in situ and operando spectroscopy techniques provides insights into how local reaction environment affects C&#8722;C coupling and key intermediates formation that lead to reaction pathways toward a desired C2+ product. The possible future direction in understanding and engineering the local reaction environment is also provided.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond distal to the amide group was achieved at room temperature under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, photocatalyzed conditions.







Abstract
The present study reports an unprecedented protocol for the phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. By utilizing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% 4DPAIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, satisfactory yields of &#947;&#8208;phosphonylated amides are obtained through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction between N&#8208;((4&#8208;cyanobenzoyl)oxy)alkanamides and 9&#8208;fluorenyl o&#8208;phenylene phosphite at room temperature. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility.

         <title>Structure Revision of a Widespread Marine Sulfonolipid Class Based on Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar structure of a newly reported group of bacterial sulfur&#8208;containing aminolipids was revised and their absolute configuration determined by a combination of analytical techniques, isolation, degradation experiments, and total synthesis. The revised structures, termed cysteinolides, diverge from previous homotaurine&#8208;based proposals, revealing a composition of a cysteinolic acid containing head group acylated with various (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur&#8208;containing amino lipids (SALs) involved in biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite their physiological relevance and abundance, SALs have only been explored through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs unresolved, hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. Herein, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously proposed homotaurine&#8208;based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an N,O&#8208;acylated cysteinolic acid&#8208;containing head group carrying various different (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids. We also performed the first validated targeted&#8208;network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering structural insight, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within marine environments.

         <title>Diversified Synthesis of Chiral Fluorinated Cyclobutane Derivatives Enabled by Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric hydroboration of cyclobutenes using Rh catalysis is reported, providing gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Upon in situ B,F&#8208;elimination (Pd is required for R=aryl), monofluorinated cyclobutenes are obtained through formal hydrodefluorination. Versatile downstream transformations make this method a platform for the diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutanes.







Abstract
The diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives has remained a difficult task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an approach for asymmetric hydroboration and formal hydrodefluorination of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes through rhodium catalysis, providing chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes and monofluorinated cyclobutenes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively. The key to the success of the two transformations relies on an efficient, mild and highly selective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration with HBPin (pinacolborane), in which the subsequent addition of a base, and a catalytic amount of palladium in some cases, results in the formation of formal hydrodefluorination products with the four&#8208;membered ring retained. The obtained chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes are versatile building blocks that provide a platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives to a great diversity.

         <title>Catalytic Access to Diastereometrically Pure Four&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Silyl&#8208;Heterocycles Using Transborylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silyl&#8208;heterocycles offer a unique handle to expand and explore chemical space, reactivity, and functionality. These are limited by the lack of catalytic methods for the preparation of diverse and functionalized silyl&#8208;heterocycles. Herein the borane&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,1&#8208;carboboration of silyl&#8208;alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolyl and silylcyclobut&#8208;2&#8208;enyl boronic esters.







Abstract
Silyl&#8208;heterocycles offer a unique handle to expand and explore chemical space, reactivity, and functionality. The shortage of catalytic methods for the preparation of diverse and functionalized silyl&#8208;heterocycles however limits widespread exploration and exploitation. Herein the borane&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,1&#8208;carboboration of silyl&#8208;alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolyl and silylcyclobut&#8208;2&#8208;enyl boronic esters. Successful, catalytic carboboration has been achieved on a variety of functionally diverse silyl&#8208;alkynes, using a borane catalyst and transborylation&#8208;enabled turnover. Mechanistic studies, including 13C&#8208;labelling, computational studies, and single&#8208;turnover experiments, suggest a reaction pathway proceeding by 1,2&#8208;hydroboration, 1,1&#8208;carboboration, and transborylation to release the alkenyl boronic ester product and regenerate the borane catalyst.

Successful, catalytic carboboration has been achieved on a variety of functionally diverse silyl-alkynes, using a borane catalyst and transborylation-enabled turnover. Mechanistic studies, including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labelling, computational studies, and single-turnover experiments, suggest a reaction pathway proceeding by 1,2-hydroboration, 1,1-carboboration, and transborylation to release the alkenyl boronic ester product and regenerate the borane catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Tsuji&#8208;Trost &#945;&#8208;Fluoroallylation of Amino Acid Esters with Gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust palladium/nickel/chiral aldehyde synergistic relay system was developed for the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with N&#8208;unprotected amino acid esters, enabling the efficient assembly of &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing a linear 2&#8208;fluoroallylic motif in a highly enantioselective manner.







Abstract
A novel enantioselective Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type cross coupling reaction between gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and N&#8208;unprotected amino acid esters enabled by synergistic Pd/Ni/chiral aldehyde catalysis is presented herein. This transformation streamlined the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) of optically active &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing a linear 2&#8208;fluoroallylic motif, which served as an appealing platform for the construction of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. The key intermediates were confirmed by HRMS detection, while DFT calculations revealed that the excellent enantioselectivity was attributed to the stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the Pd(II)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;fluoroallyl species and the Ni(II)&#8208;Schiff base complex.

         <title>Hydrogen Source Tuned Regiodivergent Asymmetric Hydroalkylations of 2&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Aldehydes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methods to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are attractive yet challenging. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes have been achieved, allowing for regio&#8208;switchable 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation and 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to furnish different homoallylic alcohol architectures from identical starting materials.







Abstract
Catalytic methods allowing for the reliable prediction and control of diverse regioselectivity along with the control of enantioselectivity to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are one of the most attractive ways in organic synthesis, which provide access to diverse enantioenriched architectures from identical starting materials. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes has been achieved, furnishing different enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol architectures in good levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction features the switch of regioselectivity tuned by the selection of proton source. The use of an acid as proton source provided asymmetric 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation products under reductive conditions, yet asymmetric 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation products were obtained with silane as hydride source. This catalytic protocol allows for the access of homoallylic alcohols with two continuous saturated carbon centers in good levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Supertwisted Chiral Gyroid Mesophase in Chiral Rod&#8208;Like Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules that cannot self&#8208;assemble in either layers or cylinders often form complex in&#8208;between &#8220;bicontinuous&#8221; structures made up of interpenetrating networks. The most widespread is the achiral &#8220;gyroid&#8221; phase, containing two antichiral networks. Here it is shown that the introduction of an asymmetric unit into the rod&#8208;like molecular core can rewind the segments of one of the nets, &#8220;supertwisting&#8221; them in reverse and making the famous gyroid chiral.







Abstract
Among the intriguing bicontinuous self&#8208;assembled structures, the gyroid cubic is the most ubiquitous. It is found in block and star polymers, surfactants with or without solvent, in thermotropic liquid crystals with end&#8208; or side&#8208;chains, and in biosystems providing structural color and modelling cell mitosis. It contains two interpenetrating networks of opposite chirality and is thus achiral if, as usual, the content of the two nets is the same. However, we now find that this is not the case for strongly chiral compounds. While achiral molecules follow the opposite twists of nets 1 and 2, molecules with a chiral center in their rod&#8208;like core fail to follow the 70&#176; twist between junctions in net 2 and instead wind against it by &#8722;110&#176; to still match the junction orientation. The metastable chiral gyroid is a high&#8208;entropy high&#8208;heat&#8208;capacity mesophase. The homochirality of its nets makes the CD signal of the thienofluorenone compounds close to that in the stable I23 phase with 3&#8197;isochiral nets.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Fibers from Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers for Body&#8208;Temperature Wearable Power Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;backboned polymer/carbon nanotube thermoelectric composite fiber is fabricated through a shear&#8208;induced orientation method. It shows simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, with a power factor of 719.48&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 as high as 3.5&#8197;times of the bare carbon nanotube fiber, opening a new avenue for the development of metal&#8208;backboned polymers in power supply.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs), with a unique backbone consisting of bonded metal atoms, are promising for optic, electric, magnetic, and thermoelectric fields. However, the application of MBP remains relatively understudied. Here, we develop a shear&#8208;induced orientation method to construct a flexible nickel&#8208;backboned polymer/carbon nanotube (NBP/CNT) thermoelectric composite fiber. It demonstrated a power factor of 719.48&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;&#8901;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which is ca. 3.5&#8197;times as high as the bare CNT fiber. Remarkably, with the regulation of carrier mobility and carrier concentration of NBP, the composite fiber further showed simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in comparison to the bare CNT fiber. The NBP/CNT fiber can be integrated into fabrics to harvest thermal energy of human body to generate an output voltage of 3.09&#8197;mV at a temperature difference of 8&#8197;K. This research opens a new avenue for the development of MBPs in power supply.

         <title>Two&#8208;Orders&#8208;of&#8208;Magnitude Enhancement of Photoinitiation Activity via a Simple Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8722;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters and the structure&#8211;activity relations of the generated radicals are revealed through experiments and DFT calculations. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a two&#8208;to&#8208;three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the photoinitiation activity.







Abstract
Development of high&#8208;performance photoinitiator is the key to enhance the printing speed, structure resolution and product quality in 3D laser printing. Here, to improve the printing efficiency of 3D laser nanoprinting, we investigate the underlying photochemistry of gold and silver nanocluster initiators under multiphoton laser excitation. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8722;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters which generate multiple radicals. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl&#8208;thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a more than two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of photoinitiation activity, as well as a significant improvement in printing resolution and fabrication window. Overall, this work for the first time unveils the detailed radical formation pathways of gold and silver nanoclusters under multiphoton activation and substantially improves their photoinitiation sensitivity via surface engineering, which pushes the limit of the printing efficiency of 3D laser lithography.

         <title>Benchmarking the Intrinsic Activity of Transition Metal Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Advanced Nanoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We innovatively adopted an electrodeposition&#8208;annealing method, synthesizing transition metal oxides (TMOs) single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Not only did we accurately measure their electrocatalytic activity, but we also specially designed a structure with a conductive core wrapped in a semiconductor (SEMI) shell, to support the actual evaluation of perovskite&#8208;type SEMI catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
The intrinsic activity assessment of transition metal oxides (TMOs) as key electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been standardized due to uncertainties regarding their structure and composition, difficulties in accurately measuring their electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and deficiencies in mass&#8208;transfer (MT) rates in conventional measurements. To address these issues, we utilized an electrodeposition&#8208;thermal annealing method to precisely synthesize single&#8208;particle TMOs with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Concurrently, we engineered low roughness, spherical surfaces for individual particles, enabling precise measurement of their ECSA. Furthermore, by constructing a conductor&#8208;core semiconductor&#8208;shell structure, we evaluated the inherent OER activity of perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials, broadening the scope beyond just conductive TMOs. Finally, using single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode technique, we systematically measured individual TMO particles of various sizes for OER, overcoming MT limitations seen in conventional approaches. These improvements have led us to propose a precise and reliable approach to evaluating the intrinsic activity of TMOs, not only validating the accuracy of theoretical calculations but also revealing a strong correlation of OER activity on the melting point of TMOs. This discovery holds significant importance for future high&#8208;throughput material research and applications, offering valuable insights in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Micro&#8208;Architected Copper based on an Ion&#8208;Exchangeable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and straightforward strategy has been developed to create intricate and dense micro&#8208;architected copper structures using an ion&#8208;exchangeable hydrogel. The resulting copper geometries showcase a minimum feature size of around 40&#8197;&#956;m, coupled with a notable twin density, electrical conductivity, and hardness. This methodology presents an effective pathway for the fabrication of micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of copper through laser&#8208;based processes poses challenges, primarily attributed to the high thermal conductivity and low laser absorptivity of copper powder or wire as the feedstock. Although the use of copper salts in vat photopolymerization&#8208;based AM techniques has garnered recent attention, achieving micro&#8208;architected copper with high conductivity and density has remained elusive. In this study, we present a facile and efficient process to create complex 3D micro&#8208;architected copper structures with superior electrical conductivity and hardness. The process entails the formulation of an ion&#8208;exchangeable photoresin, followed by the utilization of digital light processing (DLP) printing to sculpt 3D hydrogel scaffolds, which were transformed into Cu2+&#8208;chelated polymer frameworks (Cu&#8208;CPFs) with a high loading of Cu2+ ions through ion exchange, followed by debinding and sintering, results in the transformation of Cu&#8208;CPFs into miniaturized copper architectures. This methodology represents an efficient pathway for the creation of intricate micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High purity Ti3C2Tx (T=&#8722;CF3SO3) nanosheets were directly obtained via an etching route using an organic Lewis acid solvent that was completely free of HF. The obtained Ti3C2Tx terminated with &#8722;CF3SO3 had large nanosheets with an average size of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;m, the largest size reached 15&#8197;&#956;m, and the CF3SO3&#8722; surface chemistry could generally improve the stability of the suspension.







Abstract
The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T=CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15&#8197;&#956;m and high productivity (over 70&#8201;%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Bayesian Inference for Model Analyses of Supramolecular Complexes: A Case Study with Nanocarbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large bowl&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule with 126&#8197;&#960; electrons was synthesized, and a ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl complex was obtained by capturing C70 at the concave site. A method for elucidating the stoichiometries in solution&#8208;phase equilibria was devised by developing a procedure to estimate the Occam factors for Bayesian inference.







Abstract
A 126&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron nanobowl molecule, phenine tridehydrosumanene, was synthesized in 12&#8197;steps through the development of a polygon cyclization strategy that assembled the polygonal precursors by Ni&#8208;mediated macrocyclization. The bowl&#8208;shaped structure accommodated C70 as a guest at the concave site, and the ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The host&#8211;guest equilibrium in solution was studied with titration experiments using isothermal calorimetry, which provided an interesting test case for studying the host&#8211;guest stoichiometry. Bayesian inference was introduced for stoichiometric analyses of the equilibrium, and a procedure to estimate the volume of prior probability in the parameter space was developed. The Bayesian procedure functioned as Occam's razor and provided quantitative support for a specific stoichiometry.

     alt="Bayesian Inference for Model Analyses of Supramolecular Complexes: A Case Study with Nanocarbon Hosts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large bowl-shaped nanocarbon molecule with 126&#8197;&#960; electrons was synthesized, and a ball-in-bowl complex was obtained by capturing C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; at the concave site. A method for elucidating the stoichiometries in solution-phase equilibria was devised by developing a procedure to estimate the Occam factors for Bayesian inference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 126&#8197;&#960;-electron nanobowl molecule, phenine tridehydrosumanene, was synthesized in 12&#8197;steps through the development of a polygon cyclization strategy that assembled the polygonal precursors by Ni-mediated macrocyclization. The bowl-shaped structure accommodated C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; as a guest at the concave site, and the ball-in-bowl structure was determined by X-ray crystallography. The host&#8211;guest equilibrium in solution was studied with titration experiments using isothermal calorimetry, which provided an interesting test case for studying the host&#8211;guest stoichiometry. Bayesian inference was introduced for stoichiometric analyses of the equilibrium, and a procedure to estimate the volume of prior probability in the parameter space was developed. The Bayesian procedure functioned as Occam's razor and provided quantitative support for a specific stoichiometry. The method was examined with five host&#8211;guest examples comprising nanocarbon hosts, which suggested the versatility of Bayesian inference for studies of supramolecular complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Ynamides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43% and 100% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94 s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.</dc:description>

This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo-phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94 s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood-rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room-temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8211;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8211;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97% yield, up to 98% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8211;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99% yield, up to 94% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8211;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines : Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Locked Fluorescent Probes Activated by Aminopeptidase N and the Tumor Redox Environment for High&#8208;Precision Imaging of Tumor Boundaries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clear delineation of tumor margins is essential for accurate resection and decreased recurrence rate in the clinic. Fluorescence imaging is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional visual inspection by surgeons for intraoperative imaging. However, traditional probes lack accuracy in tumor diagnosis, making it difficult to depict tumor boundaries accurately. Herein, we proposed an offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy based on the &#8220;attack systems (invasive peptidase) and defense systems (reductive microenvironment)&#8221; of multi&#8208;dimensional tumor characteristics to design activatable fluorescent probes for imaging tumor boundaries precisely. Screened out from a series of ODI strategy&#8208;based probes, ANQ performed better than traditional probes based on tumor unilateral correlation by distinguishing between tumor cells and normal cells and minimizing false&#8208;positive signals from living metabolic organs. To further improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in vivo, derivatized FANQ, was prepared and successfully applied to distinguish orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from adjacent tissues in mice models and clinical samples. This work highlights an innovative strategy to develop activatable probes for rapid diagnosis of tumors and high&#8208;precision imaging of tumor boundaries, providing more efficient tools for future clinical applications in intraoperative assisted resection.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2 Reduction Catalysis on a Urea&#8208;Modified Iron Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light&#8208;induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea&#8208;modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick&#8208;started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing versatile C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond through cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct etheric C&#8208;O bonds is crucial in organic synthesis but remains barely explored. Herein, we report an innovative photoinduced low&#8208;valent zirconocene catalysis enabling the reductive coupling of ethers with high activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation suggests that photo&#8208;excitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the C(sp3)&#8208;O bond scission of benzylic ethers, leading to the benzylic radical intermediate via a single electron reduction pathway. The subsequent recombination of this benzylic radical to Zr center followed by carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for down&#8208;stream coupling with aliphatic ethers through a SN2&#8208;like mechanism. In application, a wide range of ethers readily in&#8208;situ derived from aldehydes and ketones becomes feasible with high functional group compatibility as well as excellent cross&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>
