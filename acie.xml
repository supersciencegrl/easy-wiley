         <title>Enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and energy transfer in carbon dots embedded thylakoids for photonic hybrid capacitor applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanohybrid photosystems have advantages in converting solar energy into electricity, while natural photosystems based solar&#8208;powered energy&#8208;storage device is still under developed. Here, we fabricate a new kind of photo&#8208;rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) benefiting from light&#8208;harvesting carbon dots (CDs) and natural thylakoids for realizing solar energy harvesting and storage simultaneously. Under solar light irradiation, the embedded CDs in thylakoids (CDs/Thy) can convert the less absorbed green light into highly absorbed red light for thylakoids, besides, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CDs and Thy also occurs, which facilitates the photoelectrons generation during thylakoids photosynthesis, thereby resulting in 6&#8208;fold photocurrent output in CDs/Thy hybrid photosystem, compared to pristine thylakoids. Using CDs/Thy as photocathode in ZHCs, the photonic hybrid capacitor shows photoelectric conversion and storage features. CDs can improve the photo&#8208;charging voltage response of ZHCs to ~1.2 V with a remarkable capacitance enhancement of 144% under solar light. This study provides a promising strategy for designing plant&#8208;based photonic and electric device for solar energy harvesting and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Oxygen Vacancy and High Porosity of Nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports that a low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface&#8208;active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 is enhanced to 156.9 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, over twice higher than the parent MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (76.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Measurement of Accumulation of Antibiotics to Staphylococcus aureus in Phagosomes of Live Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S. aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the lethal actions of antibiotics. While the elevated tolerance of S. aureus to small&#8208;molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial, we pose that there may be contributions related to permeation of antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA&#8208;approved antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles of live macrophages. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S. aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of tagged S. aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the arrival of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of permeability differences between extra&#8208; and intracellular S. aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 Monoliths for Selective and Durable Non&#8208;oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) are inert materials with outstanding thermal, chemical and mechanical stability. Herein, we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths at centimeter scale to endow them with high catalytic activity while maintaining their stability.  We reduce PSC &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 monoliths to create oxygen vacancies in lattice and stabilize them by the ordered lattice to construct unsaturated Al&#8208;O coordination structures for enhancing the catalytic activity. The generation of oxygen vacancy at 18e wyckoff position contribute to the unsaturated Al&#8208;O coordination. As a case study, we demonstrate the outstanding performance with conversion (~34%) and selectivity (~95%) toward non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene at 700 &#176;C. We achieve the outstanding performance without obvious degradation even after a continuous operation over 1000 hours at 700 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effect Shifts CO2 to CO Reduction by Iron Porphyrin from Fe0 to FeI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron porphyrins are among the most studied molecular catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and their reactivity is constantly being enhanced through the implementation of chemical functionalities in the second coordination sphere inspired by the active sites of enzymes. In this study, we were intrigued to observe&#160;that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2&#160;from the well&#8208;admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two&#8208;electron activation step of CO2&#160;starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)&#8210;COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C&#8210;O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)&#8210;CO species. The DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates is in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, thus allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi&#8208;electronic CO2&#160;reduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Lithium Chloride Oxidation by Covalent Organic Frameworks for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Li&#8208;Cl2 battery is a promising high energy density battery system. However, reasonable cycle life could only be achieved under low specific capacities due to the sluggish oxidation of LiCl to Cl2. Herein, we propose an amine&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) with catalytic activity, namely COF&#8208;NH2, that significantly decreases the oxidation barrier of LiCl and accelerates the oxidation kinetics of LiCl in Li&#8208;Cl2 cell. The resulting Li&#8208;Cl2 cell using COF&#8208;NH2 (Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2) simultaneously exhibits low overpotential, ultrahigh discharge capacity up to 3500 mAh/g and a promoted utilization ratio of deposited LiCl at the first cycle (UR&#8208;LiCl) of 81.4%, which is the highest report value to date. Furthermore, the Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2 cell could be stably cycled for over 200 cycles when operating at a capacity of 2000 mAh/g at &#8208;20 &#176;C with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of ~100% and a discharge plateau of 3.5 V. Impressively, the Li&#8208;Cl2@COF&#8208;NH2 pouch cell delivers an attractive energy density of &gt;400&#8201;Wh/kg based on the cathode, anode and utilized electrolyte for 50 cycles with an average CE of ~95%. Our superior Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries enabled by organocatalyst enlighten an arena towards high&#8208;energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptor Featuring Unique Self&#8208;Regulation Effect for Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The blend nanomorphology of electron&#8208;donor (D) and &#8208;acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self&#8208;regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of phenyl&#8208;phenyl and phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile&#160;(IC&#8208;2F) groups, which induced 3D charge&#160;transport with&#160;phenyl&#8208;mediated&#160;super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation&#160;was observed in Z9&#8208;based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0% (certified PCE of 18.6%) for Z9&#8208;based devices were achieved&#160;without additives, indicating the great potential of&#160;the self&#8208;regulation strategy in NFA design.</dc:description>

         <title>Ba12[BN2]6.67H4 &#8211; A Disordered Anti&#8208;Skutterudite Filled with Nitridoborate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skutterudites are of high interest in current research due their diversity of structures comprising empty, partially filled and filled variants, mostly based on metallic compounds. We herein present Ba12[BN2]6.67H4, forming a non&#8208;metallic filled anti&#8208;skutterudite. It is accessed in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction from barium subnitride, boron nitride and barium hydride at 750&#160;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data allowed to elucidate the structure in the cubic space group Im&#8208;3 (no. 204). The barium and hydride atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional network consisting of corner&#8208;sharing HBa6 octahedra and Ba12 icosahedra. Slightly bent [BN2]3&#8722; units are located in the icosahedra and the voids in&#8208;between. 1H and 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and vibrational spectroscopy further support the structure model. Quantum chemical calculations coincide well with experimental results and provide information about the electronic structure of Ba12[BN2]6.67H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Magnetic Dipole Transition Moment Be Engineered?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral compounds with enhanced chiroptical properties is an important challenge to improve device applications. To that end, an optimization of the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments of the molecule is necessary. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemical structure and such quantum mechanical properties is not always clear. That is the case of magnetic dipole transition moment (m) for which no general trends for its optimization have been suggested. In this work we propose a general rationalization for improving the magnitude of m in different families of chiral compounds. Performing a clustering analysis of hundreds of transitions, we have been able to identify a single group in which &#9474;m&#9474; value is maximized along the helix axis. More interestingly, we have found an accurate linear relationship (up to R2 = 0.994) between the maximum value of this parameter and the area of the inner cavity of the helix, thus resembling classical behavior of solenoids. This research provides a tool for the rationalized synthesis of compounds with improved chiroptical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Defect Engineering Synergistically Boost High Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency of Cerium oxide/Au Hollow Nanomushrooms for Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au) for N2 photofixation. Benefitting from judicious structural and defect engineering, the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au exhibit great nitrogen photofixation performance with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using solar illumination under ambient conditions is a promising strategy for production of the indispensable chemical NH3. However, due to the catalyst&#8216;s limitations in solar energy utilization, loss of hot electrons during transfer, and low nitrogen adsorption and activation capacity, the unsatisfactory solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiencies of most photocatalysts limit their practical applications. Herein, cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (denoted cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au). Plasmonic Au extended the absorption of light from the visible to the second near&#8208;infrared region. The superior interface greatly enhanced the transfer efficiency of hot electrons. Abundant strain&#8208;VO defects induced by interfacial compressive strain promoted adsorption and in situ activation of nitrogen, and such synergistic promotion of strain and VO defects was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The judicious structural and defect engineering co&#8208;promoted the efficient nitrogen photofixation of the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au heterostructures with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which is comparable to the average solar&#8208;to&#8208;biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants, thus exhibiting significant potential as a new candidate for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Analgesic Buxus alkaloids with Enhanced Selectivity for the Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Gated Calcium Channel Cav3.2&#8201;over Cav3.1&#8201;through a New Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is important to explore modulators with heightened selectivity index (SI) for a subtype of low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ channels (Cav3.1&#8211;3.3) for drug development. Among 23 Buxus alkaloids featuring three distinct carbon skeletons, 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type compounds 9 and 10 were identified as a novel type of Cav3.2 inhibitor. With a unique binding mode, they exhibit highly enhanced preference for Cav3.2 over Cav3.1 and robust analgesic effects.







Abstract
Low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Cav3.1&#8208;3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype of LVGCCs are still highly desired. In this study we explored three classes of Buxus alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artanes Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Cav3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Cav3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non&#8208;subtype&#8208;selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Cav3.3, BXSL showed a 30&#8208;fold selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. As compared to several well&#8208;known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Cav3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine&#8208;1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild&#8208;type and Cav3.2 knock&#8208;out mice revealed that BXSL (5&#8197;mg/kg), by inhibiting Cav3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10&#8197;mg/kg) or mibefradil (10&#8197;mg/kg). Moreover, we proposed a structural rationale for the high selectivity of 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type alkaloids towards Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. This study introduces a novel analgesic agent and valuable molecular insight for structure&#8208;based innovative Cav3.2 drug development.

     alt="Analgesic Buxus alkaloids with Enhanced Selectivity for the Low-Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Cav3.2&#8201;over Cav3.1&#8201;through a New Binding Mode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to explore modulators with heightened selectivity index (SI) for a subtype of low-voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.1&#8211;3.3) for drug development. Among 23 &lt;i&gt;Buxus&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids featuring three distinct carbon skeletons, 9(10/19)abeo-artane-type compounds &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; were identified as a novel type of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 inhibitor. With a unique binding mode, they exhibit highly enhanced preference for Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 over Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.1 and robust analgesic effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-voltage-gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.1-3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype of LVGCCs are still highly desired. In this study we explored three classes of &lt;i&gt;Buxus&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo-artanes Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non-subtype-selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.3, BXSL showed a 30-fold selectivity of Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 over Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.1. As compared to several well-known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine-1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild-type and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 knock-out mice revealed that BXSL (5&#8197;mg/kg), by inhibiting Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10&#8197;mg/kg) or mibefradil (10&#8197;mg/kg). Moreover, we proposed a structural rationale for the high selectivity of 9(10/19)abeo-artane-type alkaloids towards Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 over Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.1. This study introduces a novel analgesic agent and valuable molecular insight for structure-based innovative Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 drug development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation of Unsaturated Halide and Triflate Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint experimental and theoretical techniques highlighted three main catalytic events in an electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange reaction of aryl halides: Oxidative addition of Ar&#8722;X to a Ni(0) species first delivers a Ni(II)ArX, which undergoes salt metathesis with chloride to afford Ni(II)ArCl. The latter is electrochemically oxidized to a Ni(III) species, enabling the formation of the product upon reductive elimination.







Abstract
A robust electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of unsaturated halides and triflates (Br to Cl, I to Cl, I to Br, and OTf to Cl) is reported. A combination of NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;glyme as the precatalyst, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a ligand, NMP as the solvent, and electrochemistry allowed the generation of a nickel species that promotes reductive elimination of the desired product. This paired electrochemical halogenation is compatible with a range of unsaturated halides and triflates, including heterocycles, dihaloarenes, and alkenes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Joint experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations highlighted three catalytic events: i) oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Ni(0) species to deliver a Ni(II) intermediate; ii) halide metathesis at Ni(II); iii) electrochemical oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) to enable the formation of the desired aryl halide upon reductive elimination. This methodology allows the replacement of heavy halogens (I or Br) or polar atoms (O) with the corresponding lighter and more lipophilic Cl group to block undesired reactivity or modify the properties of drug and agrochemical candidates.

         <title>Tandem Electro&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalysis for the Oxidative Aminocarbonylation of Arylboronic Acids to Amides from CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that couples overall CO2 electroreduction with thermocatalytic oxidative aminocarbonylation was reported to produce various value&#8208;added amides.







Abstract
Direct CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals is critical for carbon neutrality, while its main products are limited to simple C1/C2 compounds, and traditionally, the anodic O2 byproduct is not utilized. We herein report a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that fully utilizes both cathodic (i.e., CO) and anodic (i.e., O2) products during overall CO2 electrolysis to produce valuable organic amides from arylboronic acids and amines in a separate chemical reactor, following the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation mechanism. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)&#8208;incorporated silver and nickel hydroxide carbonate electrocatalysts were prepared for efficient coproduction of CO and O2 with Faradaic efficiencies of 99.3&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. Systematic experiments, operando attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that HMT promotes *CO2 hydrogenation/*CO desorption for accelerated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, and O2 inhibits reductive deactivation of the Pd(II) catalyst for enhanced oxidative aminocarbonylation, collectively leading to efficient synthesis of 10 organic amides with high yields of above 81&#8201;%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic strategy for economically attractive CO2 conversion and amide synthesis, representing a new avenue to explore the full potential of CO2 utilization.

         <title>New Reaction Pathway of Superoxide Disproportionation Induced by a Soluble Catalyst in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations promote the intramolecular charge transfer of O2&#8722; dimers and accelerate their disproportionation in discharge and charge processes. This facilitates the reaction kinetics and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and 1O2 related side reactions to endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with small overvoltages and prolonged cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery has attracted considerable interest for high theoretical energy density, however the disproportionation of the intermediate of superoxide (O2&#8722;) during discharge and charge leads to slow reaction kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, the chemically stable ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations are employed as a soluble catalyst to alternate the pathway of O2&#8722; disproportionation and its kinetics in both the discharge and charge processes. RB captures O2&#8722; dimer and promotes their intramolecular charge transfer, and it decreases the energy barrier of the disproportionation reaction from 7.70 to 0.70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This facilitates the discharge and charge processes and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and singlet oxygen related side reactions. These endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.72&#8197;V and prolonged lifespan for over 230 cycles when coupled with RuO2 catalyst. This work highlights the vital role of superoxide disproportionation for Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8211;Organic Hybrid &#8220;Calixarenes&#8221; as Supramolecular Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calixarenes are among the most useful and versatile macrocycles in supramolecular chemistry. The one thing that has not changed in the 80 years since their discovery, despite numerous derivatizations, is their fully organic, covalent scaffolds. Here, we report a new type of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid &#8220;calixarenes&#8221; constructed by means of coordination&#8208;driven assembly. Replacing acetate ligands on the {SiW10Cr2(OAc)2} clusters with 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalates allows these 95&#176; inorganic building blocks to be linked into bowl&#8208;shaped, hybrid &#8220;calix[n]arenes&#8221; (n = 3, 4). With a large concave cavity, the metal&#8211;organic calix[4]arene can accommodate nanometer&#8208;sized polyoxoanions in an entropically driven process. The development of hybrid variants of calixarenes is expected to expand the scope of their physicochemical properties, guest/substrate binding, and applications on multiple fronts.</dc:description>

         <title>Quality control of mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices by compartmented DNA origami frames for precision information coding and logic mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encoded nanostructures afford an ideal platform carrying multi&#8208;channel signal components for multiplexed assay and information security. However, with the demand on exclusivity and reproducibility of coding signals, precise control on the structure and composition of nanomaterials featuring fully distinguishable signals remains challenging. By using the multiplexing capability of mass spectrometry (MS) and spatial addressability of DNA origami nanostructures, we herein propose a quality control methodology for constructing mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices (namely MNTs&#8208;TDOFs) in the scaffold of compartmented tetrahedral DNA origami frames (TDOFs), in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of four types of mass nanotags (MNTs) can be finely regulated and customized to generate characteristic MS patterns. The programmability of combinatorial MNTs and orthogonality of individual compartments allows further evolution of MNTs&#8208;TDOFs to static tagging agents and dynamic nanoprobes for labeling and sensing of multiple targets. More importantly, structure control at single TDOF level ensures the constancy of prescribed MS outputs, by which a high&#8208;capacity coding system was established for secure information encryption and decryption. In addition to the multiplexed outputs in parallel, the nanodevices could also map logic circuits with interconnected complexity and logic events of c&#8208;Met recognition and dimerization on cell surface for signaling regulation by MS interrogation.</dc:description>

         <title>Why do Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Catalysts Outperform both Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Nanocatalysts on MXene?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), combining the advantages of single&#8208;atom and nanoparticles (NPs), play an extremely significant role in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, understanding the catalytic mechanism of SAAs in catalysis reactions remains a challenge compared with single atoms and NPs. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;nickel SAAs (RuNiSAAs) synthesized by embedding atomically dispersed Ru in Ni NPs are anchored on two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene. The RuNiSAAs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx catalysts exhibit unprecedented activity for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis with a mass&#8208;specific activity rmass value of 333 L min&#8208;1 gRu&#8208;1. Theoretical calculations reveal that the anchoring of SAAs on Ti3C2Tx optimizes the dissociation of AB and H2O as well as the binding ability of H* intermediates during AB hydrolysis due to the d&#8208;band structural modulation caused by the alloying effect and metal&#8208;supports interactions (MSI) compared with single atoms and NPs. This work provides useful design principles for developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen&#8208;related catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of SAAs over NPs and single atoms in energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Structural Disorder in Metal (Oxy)hydroxides and Catalytic Activity in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the correlation between the structural evolution of electrocatalysts and their catalytic activity is both essential and challenging. In this study, we investigate this correlation in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by examining the influence of structural disorder during/after the dynamic structural evolution on their OER activity of Fe&#8208;Ni (oxy)hydroxide catalysts using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, alongside other experiments and theoretical calculations. The Debye&#8208;Waller factors obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reflect the degree of structural disorder and exhibit a robust correlation with the intrinsic OER activities of the electrocatalysts. Enhanced OER activity of in&#8208;situ generated metal (oxy)hydroxides derived from different pre&#8208;catalysts is linked to increased structural disorder, offering a promising approach for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts. This strategy may inspire similar investigations in related electrocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Electroreduction of O2 into H2O2 over ZnCo Bimetallic Triazole Frameworks Promoted by Ligand Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework has been developed as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The unique ligand effect of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole optimizes the electronic structure of Co sites and enables an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2 molecule, resulting in an excellent 2e&#8722; ORR performance with a selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;% and an H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) are highly promising for H2O2 production, but suffer from the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report a ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;MTF) as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the coordination between 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and Co increases the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy on the Co&#8722;N bond, promoting the activation of Co center. Besides, the adjacent Zn&#8722;Co sites on 1,2,3&#8208;triazole enable an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2, favoring the reduction of O2 molecules and desorption of OOH* intermediate. By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo&#8208;MTF exhibits a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;%, onset potential of 0.614&#8197;V and H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zeolite imidazole frameworks. Our work paves the way for the design of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts with desirable coordination and electronic structure.

         <title>Tuning the Aggregates of Thiophene&#8208;based Trimers by Methyl Side&#8208;chain Engineering for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT)&#8208;based conjugated trimers and their photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by methyl side&#8208;chain engineering. TBT&#8208;3 with the smallest size of aggregates and highest crystallinity exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, which is due to the shorter charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors (OCSs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic materials for photocatalysis. However, the aggregation of OCSs in photocatalytic aqueous solution caused by self&#8208;assembly, which closely relates to the photocatalytic activity, has not yet been studied. Here, the relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;Bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT) and the photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by introducing and varying the position of methyl side chains on the two peripheral thiophene units. Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the introduction of &#8208;CH3 group at the 3&#8208;position of TBT resulted in the smallest size and best crystallinity of aggregates compared to that of TBT, 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions. As a result, TBT&#8208;3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution, ascribed to the shorten charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order. These results suggest the important role of aggregation behavior of OCSs for efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Olefination of Aromatic Carbonyls via Site&#8208;Specific Activation of Cycloalkanone Ketals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple substrate design allows site&#8208;specific activation of cyclic ketones for olefination reaction of aromatic carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Skeletal editing is an important strategy in organic synthesis as it modifies the carbon backbone to tailor molecular structures with precision, enabling access to compounds with specific desired properties. Skeletal editing empowers chemists to transform synthetic approaches of target compounds across diverse applications from drug discovery to materials science. Herein, we introduce a new skeletal editing method to convert readily available aromatic carbonyl compounds into valuable unsaturated carboxylic acids with extended carbon chains. Our reaction setup enables a cascade reaction of enolization&#8208;[2+2]cycloaddition&#8208;[2+2]cycloreversion between aromatic carbonyl compounds and ketals of cyclic ketones to generate unsaturated carboxylic acids as ring&#8208;opening products. Through a simple design, our substrates are specifically activated to react at predetermined positions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. This practical method offers convenient access to versatile organic building blocks as well as provides fresh insights into manipulating traditional reaction pathways for new synthetic applications.

Abstract
Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organoring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3&#8201;%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metal &#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Active Sites of Cobalt Phthalocyanine in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic and spectroscopic characterizations of cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT) and its catalyst analogs are reported. The results help us understand the nature of the active site for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol.







Abstract
Many metal coordination compounds catalyze CO2 electroreduction to CO, but cobalt phthalocyanine hybridized with conductive carbon such as carbon nanotubes is currently the only one that can generate methanol. The underlying structure&#8211;reactivity correlation and reaction mechanism desperately demand elucidation. Here we report the first in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, combined with ex situ spectroscopic and electrocatalytic measurements, to study CoPc&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to methanol. Molecular dispersion of CoPc on CNT surfaces, as evidenced by the observed electronic interaction between the two, is crucial to fast electron transfer to the active sites and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. CO, the key intermediate in the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway, is found to be labile on the active site, which necessitates a high local concentration in the microenvironment to compete with CO2 for active sites and promote methanol production. A comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of structurally related porphyrins indicates that the bridging aza&#8208;N atoms of the Pc macrocycle are critical components of the CoPc active site that produces methanol. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identifies the active site as Co(I) and supports an increasingly non&#8208;centrosymmetric Co coordination environment at negative applied potential, likely due to the formation of a Co&#8722;CO adduct during the catalysis.

         <title>Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezocatalyst for H2O2 production gives a yield of 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water and air. The metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinder the rapid H2O2 decomposition. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) component for O2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H2O2 production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H2O2 production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H2O2 on MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g&#8208;C3N4 for O2 reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O2 and H+ to further promote ORR. Thus, MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 can be used as an efficient piezocatalyst to generate H2O2 at rates up to 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in air and pure water without using sacrificial agents. This work proposes a new strategy for efficient piezocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by constructing multiple active sites in semiconductor catalysts via hydrogen bonding, by enhancing substrate adsorption, rapid separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and preventing rapid decomposition of H2O2.

     alt="Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal-Organic Cage-Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piezocatalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production gives a yield of 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water and air. The metal-organic cage (MOC) component enhances substrate (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and product (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinder the rapid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) component for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal-organic cage-coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC-AuNP/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC-AuNP/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and product (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on MOC-AuNP/g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to further promote ORR.

         <title>Regiodivergent Carbonylation of Alkenes: Selective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Linear and Branched Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first regioselective selenocarbonylation of alkenes is reported. This general protocol provides a variety of branched and linear selenoesters with wide functional group compatibility and tunable regioselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented regiodivergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic alkenes has been developed. Utilizing commercially available Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 in the presence of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenediyl&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphine) ligand L8 diverse selenoesters are obtained in a straightforward manner. Key to success for the control of the regioselectivity of the carbonylation step is the concentration of the acidic co&#8208;catalyst. This general protocol features wide functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the presence of stoichiometric amounts of acid changes the properties and coordination mode of the ligand leading to reversed regioselectivity.

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Alanine&#8208;Tyramine Conjugates into Versatile, Uniform, Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Organic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;loaded uniform hollow organic nanoparticles (NPs) can be prepared by enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) by employing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and short alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates. These NPs allowed efficient detection of salivary glucose levels through s fluorimetry assay of dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Surface modification of these NPs by using different phenolic additives (tyramine/tannic acid) was also possible.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) procedure that converts alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates into highly uniform enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocontainers by the action of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in an aqueous medium under ambient conditions. The NP formation was possible with both enantiomers of alanine, and the average diameter could be varied from 150&#8197;nm to 250&#8197;nm (with a 5&#8211;12&#8201;% standard deviation of as&#8208;prepared samples) depending on the precursor concentration. About 60&#8201;% of the added HRP enzyme was entrapped within the NPs and was subsequently utilized for post&#8208;synthetic modification of the NPs with phenolic compounds such as tyramine or tannic acid. One&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme entrapment of glucose oxidase (GOx) and peroxidase (HRP) within the NPs was also achieved. These GOx&#8208;HRP loaded NPs allowed multimodal detection of glucose, including that present in human saliva, with a limit of detection (LoD) of 740&#8197;nM through fluorimetry. The NPs exhibited good cytocompatibility and were stable to changes in pH (acidic to basic), temperature, ultrasonication, and even the presence of organic solvent (EtOH) to a certain extent, since they are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The proposed e&#8208;DISA procedure can be widely expanded through the design of diverse enzyme&#8208;responsive precursors.

         <dc:description>Abstract: The development of new methods for enantioselective reactions that generate stereogenic centres within molecules are a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Typically, metal catalysts bearing chiral ligands as well as chiral organocatalysts have been employed for the enantioselective synthesis of organic compounds. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in the main group catalysis for enantioselective reactions using the p&#8208;block elements (boron, aluminium, phosphorus, bismuth) as a complementary and sustainable approach to generate chiral molecules. Several of these catalysts benefit in terms of high abundance, low toxicity, high selectivity, and excellent reactivity. This minireview summarises the utilisations of chiral p&#8208;block element catalysts for asymmetric reactions to generate value&#8208;added compounds. This review is categorised into the following sections:&#160;
1. Introduction; 2. Enantioselective reactions using p&#8208;block elements; 2.1. Borane catalysis using a cooperative chiral ligands or chiral boranes; 2.2. Frustrated Lewis pairs using chiral Lewis acids or bases; 2.3. Aluminium catalysis using chiral Al&#8208;salen complexes; 2.4. Bismuth catalysis using cooperative chiral phosphoric acid catalysts; 5.

         <title>Fluorescent&#8208;Probe Characterization for Pore&#8208;Space Mapping with Single&#8208;Particle Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous solids often contain complex pore networks with pores of various sizes. Tracking individual fluorescent probes as they diffuse through porous materials can be used to characterize pore networks at tens of nanometers resolution. However, understanding the motion behavior of fluorophores in confinement is crucial to reliably derive pore network properties. Here, we introduce well&#8208;defined lithography&#8208;made model pores developed to study probe behavior in confinement. We investigated the influence of probe&#8211;host interactions on diffusion and trapping of confined single&#8208;emitter quantum&#8208;dot probes. Using the pH&#8208;responsiveness of the probes, we were able to largely suppress trapping at the pore walls. This enabled us to define experimental conditions for mapping of the accessible pore space of a one&#8208;dimensional pore array as well as a real&#8208;life polymerization catalyst support particle.</dc:description>

To avoid droplet coalescence, fluoropolymer&#8208;based surfactants are commonly used to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible phases to stabilize droplet interfaces. However, the conventional preparation of fluorosurfactants involves multiple steps of conjugation reactions between fluorinated and hydrophilic segments to form multiple&#8208;block copolymers. In addition, synthesis of customized surfactants with tailored properties is challenging due to the complex synthesis process. Here, we report a highly efficient synthetic method that utilizes living radical polymerization (LRP) to produce fluorosurfactants with tailored functionalities. Compared to the commercialized surfactant, our surfactants outperform in thermal cycling for PCR testing, and exhibit exceptional biocompatibility for cell and yeast culturing in a double&#8208;emulsion system. This breakthrough synthetic approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics by enabling the development of novel designs that generate droplets with superior stability and functionality for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Styrenes into Ketones under Ambient Conditions Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of palladium catalysts for Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins into ketones by first&#8208;row transition metals is a relevant approach for searching more sustainable protocols. Besides highly sophisticated iron catalysts, all the other first&#8208;row transition metal complexes have only led to poor activities and selectivities. Herein, we show that the cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex is a competent catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of styrenes into ketones with silanes as the hydrogen sources. Remarkably, under room temperature and air atmosphere, the reactions were exceedingly fast (up to 10 minutes) with a low catalyst loading (1 mol%) while keeping an excellent chemo&#8208; and Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity (up to 99% of ketone). Unprecedently high TOF (864 h&#8208;1) and TON (5,800) were reached for the oxidation of aromatic olefins under these benign conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction mechanism similar to the Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of olefins with a change in the last fundamental step, which controls the chemoselectivity, thanks to a unique hydrogen bonding network between the ethanol solvent and the cobalt peroxo intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Relationships Between Defectivity and Porosity in High Surface Area Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous aromatic framework microporosity is known to be strongly dependent on synthetic approach but little is known about why certain reactions consistently yield significantly more porous materials than other methods. This article explores the connections between synthetic pathway, polymer defectivity, and microporosity. Using a network disassembly strategy, we show that defectivity is highly dependent on synthetic approach and that more defective polymers are associated with lower surface areas and pore volumes. This empirical association is corroborated through systematic introduction of defects to a model polymer, which results in significant reduction of apparent surface area and pore volumes. Taken together, these data suggest that only highly efficient coupling reactions should be targeted for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high surface area porous aromatic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Propargyl&#8208;Aryl Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.







Abstract
Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8208;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal [4+1] Cyclization of Benzyl Alcohols and Benzaldimines: Facile Access to Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] annulation of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines with secondary silanes has been achieved in excellent enantioselectivity to afford a range of sila&#8208;O&#8208; and sila&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles with silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers, where the rhodium catalyst plays a dual role in the O/N&#8208;Si and C&#8208;Si coupling.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;to&#8208;silicon switch in formation of bioactive sila&#8208;heterocycles with a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center has garnered significant interest in drug discovery. However, metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of such scaffolds is still in its infancy. Herein, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] cyclization of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines has been realized by enantioselective difunctionalization of a secondary silane reagent, affording chiral&#8208;at&#8208;silicon cyclic silyl ethers and sila&#8208;isoindolines, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the rhodium&#8208;hydride catalyst. The coupling system proceeds via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;determining dehydrogenative OH silylation of the benzyl alcohol or hydrosilylation of the imine to give an enantioenriched silyl ether or silazane intermediate, respectively. The same rhodium catalyst also enables subsequent intramolecular cyclative C&#8722;H silylation directed by the pendent Si&#8208;H group. Experimental and DFT studies have been conducted to explore the mechanism of the OH bond silylation of benzyl alcohol, where the Si&#8208;O reductive elimination from a Rh(III) hydride intermediate has been established as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation Enables the Stereoselective Synthesis and Structure Revision of Indidene Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indane polyketides indidenes A and C were synthesized from a common intermediate through nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, respectively. The common diol intermediate was obtained by palladium&#8208;catalyzed methylene C&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective modes. This study led to the revision of the absolute configuration of indidene C.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of two indane polyketides of the indidene family, namely (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A (11 steps, 1.7&#8201;%) and (+)&#8208;indidene C (13 steps, 1.3&#8201;%), is reported. The synthesis of the trans&#8208;configured common indane intermediate was enabled by palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective (e.r. 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) modes. Further elaboration of this common intermediate by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling allowed the rapid installation of the aroyl moiety of (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A. In parallel, the biphenyl system of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;indidene C was constructed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. These investigations led us to revise the structures of indidenes B and C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an [M8L24]16+ Intertwined Cube and a Giant [M12L16]24+ Orthobicupola</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been used to create a giant orthobicupola and an intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type cube&#8221;. The concept of generating intricate structures through the use of flexibility in the form of an elongated, flexible terphenyl&#8208;based tetratopic ligand (L2) in combination with a cis&#8208;blocked Pd(II) metal counterpart led to the formation of this uncommon water&#8208;soluble intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; cube.







Abstract
Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1). When flexibility is introduced into the ligand by the incorporation of a &#8208;CH2&#8208; group between the dipyridylamine and terphenyl rings in the ligand (L2), anunique [M8L24]16+ water&#8208;soluble &#8216;intertwined cubic structure&#8217; (2) results. The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and &#8242;intertwined cubic structure&#8242; in this scenario. This research showcases the ability to design and fabricate novel, topologically distinctive molecular structures by a straightforward and efficient approach.

The concept of generating intricate structures through the use of flexibility in the form of an elongated, flexible terphenyl-based tetratopic ligand (&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;) in combination with a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-blocked Pd(II) metal counterpart led to the formation of this uncommon water-soluble intertwined &#8220;A-type&#8221; cube.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Evaluation of Neuroprotective Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of central chiral azomethine imines relies on the kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. In this study, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N'&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Preventing Dissolution of Cathode Active Materials by Ion&#8208;anchoring Zeolite&#8208;based Separators for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices due to their safety and low cost. However, they face challenges such as anodic dendrite formation and cathodic compound dissolution. Here, we present the development of a polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) by synthesizing zeolite materials on a flexible polymeric membrane. This separator acts as an effective ionic barrier, preventing the leaching and shuttling of vanadium from the cathode, while significantly inhibiting the formation of by&#8208;products and zinc dendrites. The SZ cells demonstrate stable operation for more than 400 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, with an initial capacity of 375.4 mAh g&#8722;1, and over 10,000 cycles at 15 A g&#8722;1. Notably, when pre&#8208;anchored with vanadium ions, the SZ&#8208;V cells exhibited excellent capacity retention of up to 94.6% over 1000 cycles. The SZ separator featuring an ion barrier represents a crucial advancement towards the commercialization of zinc storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Degradation of Ether&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leveraging electrochemistry to degrade robust polymeric materials has the potential to impact society&#8217;s growing issue of plastic waste. Herein, we develop an electrocatalytic oxidative degradation of polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) via electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen. We investigated the selectivity and efficiency of this method, finding our conditions to be highly selective for polymers with hydridic, electron&#8208;rich C&#8211;H bonds. We leveraged this reactivity to degrade polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) in the presence of polymethacrylates and polyacrylates with complete selectivity. Furthermore, this method made polyacrylates degradable by incorporating ether units into the polymer backbone. We quantified degradation products, identifying up to 36 mol% of defined oxidation products, including acetic acid, formic acid, and acetaldehyde, and we extended this method to degrade a polyether&#8208;based polyurethane in a green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile, electrochemically&#8208;driven route to degrade polymers containing ether functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Vaccination with An Injectable Nucleic Acid Hydrogel for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have emerged as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their efficacies are frequently impeded by challenges including inadequate antigen encapsulation, insufficient immune activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report a three&#8208;in&#8208;one hydrogel assembled by nucleic acids (NAs) that can serve as a vaccine to in situ trigger strong immune response against cancer. Through site&#8208;specifically grafting the chemodrug, 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (also known as SN38), onto three component phosphorothioate (PS) DNA strands, a Y&#8208;shaped motif (Y&#8208;motif) with sticky ends is self&#8208;assembled, at one terminus of which an unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) segment is introduced as an immune agonist. Thereafter, programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) siRNA that performs as immune checkpoint inhibitor is designed as a crosslinker to assembly with the CpG&#8208; and SN38&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, resulting in the formation of final NA hydrogel vaccine. With three functional agents inside, the hydrogel can remarkably induce the immunogenic cell death to enhance the antigen presentation, promoting the dendritic cell maturation and effector T lymphocyte infiltration, as well as relieving the immunosuppressive tumor environment. When inoculated twice at tumor sites, the vaccine demonstrates a substantial antitumor effect in melanoma mouse model, proving its potential as a general platform for synergistic cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe our synthetic efforts toward the pupukeanane natural products, in which we have completed the first enantiospecific route to 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane in 10 steps (formal synthesis), enabled by a key Pd&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade. This subsequently facilitated an unprecedented bio&#8208;inspired &#8216;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8217; rearrangement, providing divergent access to 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane in 15 steps (formal synthesis). Computational studies provide insight into the nature of this rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenide rocksalt crystals are associated with metavalent bonding (MVB), a recent subject of debate. In this study, we investigate various 2D lattices of chalcogenides to understand MVB. Honeycomb lattices adhere to the 8&#8208;N rule and are covalently bonded. Square and orthorhombic structures display in&#8208;plane MVB, driven by p&#8208;p orbital interactions, with cationic lone pairs inducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puckering.







Abstract
An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of Group&#8197;IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored. While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, with cationic lone pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.

         <title>Engineered Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Carbon Nanotube Conjugates for Tissue&#8208;Translatable Glucose Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the development of nIR fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors for glucose imaging. The authors find that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the enzymatic activity but rather triggered by the substrate&#8208;enzyme binding. Leveraging this unique mechanism, the authors developed catalytically inactive nanosensors that enable glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.







Abstract
Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40&#8201;% within 1&#8197;s of exposure to glucose without consuming the glucose analyte. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.

         <title>Well&#8208;defined N3C1&#8208;anchored Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N3C1&#8208;anchored single metal sites in well&#8208;defined molecules are studied to make up the structure&#8208;property correlation study challenge for carbon materials. The established volcano plots and the experimental catalysis results provide possibilities of fundamental understanding of asymmetric single metal active sites for electrochemical catalysis.







Abstract
N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal&#8208;sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. However, significant challenges persist in the precise design of well&#8208;defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case&#8208;by&#8208;case reports using carbon materials as investigation targets. In this work, the well&#8208;defined molecular catalysts with N3C1&#8208;anchored SMSs, i.e., N&#8208;confused metalloporphyrins (NCPor&#8208;Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor&#8208;Ms with corresponding N4&#8208;anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrins, Por&#8208;Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor&#8208;Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor&#8208;Co also shows the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than that of Por&#8208;Co (0.77&#8197;V vs. RHE). Electron&#8208;rich, low band gap and regulated d&#8208;band center contribute to the high activity of NCPor&#8208;Co. This study delves into the examination of well&#8208;defined asymmetric SMS molecular catalysts, encompassing both theoretical and experimental facets. It serves as a pioneering step towards enhancing the fundamental comprehension and facilitating the development of high&#8208;performance asymmetric SMS catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS) Assay for Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of Antibodies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the ultrasensitive, specific, selective and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using a strategy that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification.







Abstract
Here we report the development of a method for the electrochemical ultrasensitive detection of antibodies that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification. The platform, termed Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS), is based on the use of antigen&#8208;DNA conjugates that, upon the bivalent binding of a specific target antibody, induce the release of an enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand from a preformed duplex. Such enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand can then be electrochemically detected with a disposable electrode with high sensitivity. We applied ELIDIS to demonstrate the sensitive (limit of detection in the picomolar range), specific and multiplexed detection of five different antibodies including three clinically relevant ones. ELIDIS is also rapid (it only requires two reaction steps), works well in complex media (serum) and is cost&#8208;effective. A direct comparison with a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of Cetuximab demonstrates the promising features of ELIDIS as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care platform for antibodies detection.

         <title>Fully Aromatic Self&#8208;Assembled Hole&#8208;Selective Layer toward Efficient Inverted Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultraviolet Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as MeO&#8208;PhPACz, is employed as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The fully aromatic configuration is crucial in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. The optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;% and excellent UV resistance.







Abstract
Ultraviolet&#8208;induced degradation has emerged as a critical stability concern impeding the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in the context of phase&#8208;unstable wide&#8208;band gap perovskite films. This study introduces a novel approach by employing a fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz), as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap PSCs. Incorporating a conjugated linker plays a pivotal role in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL on substrates, facilitating subsequent perovskite interfacial interactions, and fostering the growth of uniform perovskite films. The high&#8208;quality film could effectively suppress interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs, featuring a band gap of 1.68&#8197;eV, attain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;%. Remarkably, MeO&#8208;PhPACz demonstrates inherent UV resistance and heightened UV absorption capabilities, substantially improving UV resistance for the targeted PSCs. This characteristic holds significance for the feasibility of large&#8208;scale outdoor applications.

         <title>Synchronous Elimination of Excess Photoinstable PbI2 and Interfacial Band Mismatch for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sufficient conversion of residual photoinstable PbI2 into robust 1D perovskite (EMIMPbI3) to improve device stability, while the formation of an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface can reduce the energetic mismatch via a single process. The optimized device delivers an efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% and a remarkable open circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V, accompanied with excellent humidity and operational stability.







Abstract
Eliminating the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI2) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two&#8208;step sequential deposition method. Here, the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) is employed to convert superfluous PbI2 to more robust 1D EMIMPbI3 which can withstand lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently, the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% with one of the highest open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.

         <title>Carbon Oxyanion Self&#8208;Transformation on NiFe Oxalates Enables Long&#8208;Term Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon transformation (from C2O42&#8722; to CO32&#8722;) not only facilitates the generation of active sites but also defends the key active oxyhydroxides against surface chlorine chemistry during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline seawater. Moreover, NiFe oxalates on Ni foam ((NiFe)C2O4/NF) outperforms reported catalysts by achieving 600&#8208;h operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with minimal potential losses.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H2 in coastal areas, and NiFe&#8208;based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&#8722; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in situ carbon oxyanion self&#8208;transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high&#8208;valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In situ/ex situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during ASO even at an ampere&#8208;level current density (j). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349&#8197;mV to attain a j of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO32&#8722; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600&#8197;h of electrolysis under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self&#8208;transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion systems.

         <title>Gram&#8208;level NH3 Electrosynthesis via NOx reduction on a Cu Activated Co Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis from NOx on a Cu&#8208;activated Co foam electrode was developed as a promising alternative for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The new synthesis can convert pollutants into elevated value&#8208;added NH3 applicable for agriculture, energy storage, etc., imposing a sustainable nitrogen cycle.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis is one promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch route. However, the industrial requirement for the electrochemical NH3 production with amperes current densities or gram&#8208;level NH3 yield remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report the high&#8208;rate NH3 production via NO2&#8722; reduction using the Cu activated Co electrode in a bipolar membrane (BPM) assemble electrolyser, wherein BPM maintains the ion balance and the liquid level of electrolyte. Benefited from the abundant Co sites and optimal structure, the target modified Co foam electrode delivers a current density of 2.64&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 96.45&#8201;% and the high NH3 yield rate of 279.44&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H&#8208;type cell using alkaline electrolyte. Combined with in situ experiments and theoretical calculations, we found that Cu optimizes the adsorption behavior of NO2&#8722; and facilitates the hydrogenation steps on Co sites toward a rapid NO2&#8722; reduction process. Importantly, this activated Co electrode affords a large NH3 production up to 4.11&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a homemade reactor, highlighting its large&#8208;scale practical feasibility.

         <title>Perovskite Oxide as A New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Sr and Ru perovskite oxide is constructed by modulating the Sr&#8208;site deficiency, thus exhibiting high Faradaic efficiency (38.6&#8201;%) and high NO3&#8722; yield rate (17.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in the electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR). The Ru active sites along with their adjacent oxygen vacancies in the perovskite oxide enhance the adsorption/activation of N2 molecules and decrease the thermodynamic barrier towards NOR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) offers an efficient and sustainable approach for conversion of widespread nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrate (NO3&#8722;) under mild conditions, representing a promising alternative to the traditional approach that involves harsh Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes. Unfortunately, due to the weak absorption/activation of N2 and the competitive oxygen evolution reaction, the kinetics of NOR process is extremely sluggish accompanied with low Faradaic efficiencies and NO3&#8722; yield rates. In this work, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched perovskite oxide with nonstoichiometric ratio of strontium and ruthenium (denoted as Sr0.9RuO3) was synthesized and explored as NOR electrocatalyst, which can exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency (38.6&#8201;%) with a high NO3&#8722; yield rate (17.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The experimental results show that the amount of oxygen vacancies in Sr0.9RuO3 is greatly higher than that of SrRuO3, following the same trend as their NOR performance. Theoretical simulations unravel that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 can render a decreased thermodynamic barrier toward the oxidation of *N2 to *N2OH at the rate&#8208;determining step, leading to its enhanced NOR performance.

&lt;p&gt;An oxygen-vacancy-enriched Sr and Ru perovskite oxide is constructed by modulating the Sr-site deficiency, thus exhibiting high Faradaic efficiency (38.6&#8201;%) and high NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The Ru active sites along with their adjacent oxygen vacancies in the perovskite oxide enhance the adsorption/activation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and decrease the thermodynamic barrier towards NOR.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Salt Template Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Fast Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, a facile and green recyclability room&#8208;temperature salt template antisolvent precipitation strategy is developed to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D pore carbon (N&#8208;3DPC). In situ Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses reveal that N&#8208;3DPC has highly reversible adsorption, fill, and intercalation reaction mechanisms, resulting in superior alkali metal&#8208;ion storage performance.







Abstract
The water&#8208;soluble salt&#8208;template technique holds great promise for fabricating 3D porous materials. However, an equipment&#8208;free and pore&#8208;size controllable synthetic approach employing salt&#8208;template precursors at room temperature has remained unexplored. Herein, we introduce a green room&#8208;temperature antisolvent precipitation strategy for creating salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors to universally produce 3D porous materials with controllable pore size. Through a combination of theoretical simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we unveil the antisolvent precipitation mechanism and provide guidelines for selecting raw materials and controlling the size of precipitated salt. Following the calcination and washing steps, we achieve large&#8208;scale and universal production of 3D porous materials and the recycling of the salt templates and antisolvents. The optimized nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon (N&#8208;3DPC) materials demonstrate distinctive structural benefits, facilitating a high capacity for potassium&#8208;ion storage along with exceptional reversibility. This is further supported by in situ electrochemical impedance spectra, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The anode shows a high rate capacity of 181&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the full cell. This study addresses the knowledge gap concerning the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of porous materials, thereby expanding their potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Dendritic sp Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Polymers with Synergistic Multi&#8208;Active Groups for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The C&#8801;C linked covalent benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic polymer with fluorine side groups is obtained for lithium organic batteries and exhibits superior electrochemical properties through the optimized molecule structure among alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups.







Abstract
Green organic materials composed of C, H, O, and N elements are receiving more and more attention worldwide. However, the high solubility, poor electrical conductivity, and long activation time limit the development of organic materials in practice. Herein, two stable covalent organic materials with alkynyl linkage between benzene rings and benzothiadiazole groups with different amounts of fluorine atoms modification (defined as BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F), are designed for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Both BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F can achieve superior reversible capacities of &#8776;719.8 and 713.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100&#8197;cycles on account of the redox activity of alkynyl (two&#8208;electron involved) and benzothiadiazole units (five&#8208;electron involved) in these organic materials. While BOP&#8208;2F electrodes exhibit much more stable cycling performance than BOP&#8208;0F electrodes, especially without pronounced capacity ascending during initial cycling. It can be assigned to the synergy effect of alkynyl linkage and fluorine atom modification in BOP&#8208;2F. The lithium storage and activation mechanism of alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups have also been deeply probed by a series of material characterizations and theoretical simulations. This work could be noteworthy in providing novel tactics for the molecular design and investigation of high&#8208;efficiency organic electrodes for energy storage.

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High&#8208;Toughness Hydrogels Regulated by Porous Cationic Polymers: the Effect of Counteranions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;hysteresis and high&#8208;toughness hydrogels were developed through controllable interactions of porous cationic polymers (PCPs) with adjustable counteranions. This strategy reduces chain segment slippage under load, endowing the PCP&#8208;based hydrogels (PCP&#8208;gels) with good elasticity under large deformations (7&#8201;% hysteresis at a strain ratio of 40).







Abstract
Service life and range of polymer materials is heavily reliant on their elasticity and mechanical stability under long&#8208;term loading. Slippage of chain segments under load leads to significant hysteresis of the hydrogels, limiting its repeatability and mechanical stability. Achieving the desired elasticity exceeding that of rubber is a great challenge for hydrogels, particularly when subjected to large deformations. Here, low&#8208;hysteresis and high&#8208;toughness hydrogels were developed through controllable interactions of porous cationic polymers (PCPs) with adjustable counteranions, including reversible bonding of PCP frameworks/polymer segments (polyacrylamide, PAAm) and counteranions/PAAm. This strategy reduces chain segment slippage under load, endowing the PCP&#8208;based hydrogels (PCP&#8208;gels) with good elasticity under large deformations (7&#8201;% hysteresis at a strain ratio of 40). Furthermore, due to the enlarged chain segments entanglement by PCP, the PCP&#8208;gels exhibit large strain (13000&#8201;%), significantly enhanced toughness (68 MJ m&#8722;3), high fracture energy (43.1&#8197;kJ m&#8722;2), and fatigue resistance. The unique properties of these elastic PCP&#8208;gels have promising applications in the field of flexible sensors.

         <title>High Gas Permeability in Aged Superglassy Membranes with Nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 Network Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel network filler, composed of nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) and carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) was prepared and was introduced into PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membranes (TFN). Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation and physical aging.







Abstract
Superglassy membranes synthesised by polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) suffer from physical aging and show poor gas permeance over time, especially thin membranes, due to the fast rearrangement of nonequilibrium polymer chains. Herein, we constructed a novel PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membrane (TFN) using nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 (&#8776;10&#8197;nm)/carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) as the composite filler. Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation, and thus physical aging. Nanosizing of UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 was achieved by regulating the nucleation kinetics using carbon quantum dots (CQD) during the synthesis. This led to increased surface area, and hence more functional groups to bond with cPIM&#8208;1 (via hydrogen bonding between &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;COOH groups), which also improved interfacial compatibility between the 3D network and polymer chains avoiding defect formation. As a result, the novel TFN showed significantly improved performance in gas separation along with reduced aging (i.e. &#8776;6&#8201;% loss in CO2 permeability over 63&#8197;days); the aged membranes had a CO2 permeance of 2504 GPU and ideal selectivity values of 37.2 and 23.8 for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;A novel network filler, composed of nanosized UiO-66&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) and carboxylated PIM-1 (cPIM-1) was prepared and was introduced into PIM-1 thin film nanocomposite membranes (TFN). Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO-66&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/cPIM-1 forms a stable three-dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation and physical aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superglassy membranes synthesised by polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) suffer from physical aging and show poor gas permeance over time, especially thin membranes, due to the fast rearrangement of nonequilibrium polymer chains. Herein, we constructed a novel PIM-1 thin film nanocomposite membrane (TFN) using nanosized UiO-66&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8776;10&#8197;nm)/carboxylated PIM-1 (cPIM-1) as the composite filler. Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO-66&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/cPIM-1 forms a stable three-dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation, and thus physical aging. Nanosizing of UiO-66&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was achieved by regulating the nucleation kinetics using carbon quantum dots (CQD) during the synthesis. This led to increased surface area, and hence more functional groups to bond with cPIM-1 (via hydrogen bonding between &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8722;COOH groups), which also improved interfacial compatibility between the 3D network and polymer chains avoiding defect formation. As a result, the novel TFN showed significantly improved performance in gas separation along with reduced aging (i.e. &#8776;6&#8201;% loss in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability over 63&#8197;days); the aged membranes had a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2504 GPU and ideal selectivity values of 37.2 and 23.8 for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Electronic Structure of Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites by sp3&#8208;Hybridized Carbon and Incorporating Chlorine to Boost Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>

A heteroatom&#8208;doped metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a high oxygen reduction reaction activity in alkaline electrolyte. Liquid rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode has a good performance, and more importantly, the assembled flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable ZAB demonstrates a high power densities and charging/discharging stability at low, room, and high temperatures.







Abstract
Development of efficient and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare low&#8208;cost oxygen reaction electrocatalysts is essential for widespread application of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we mixed NaCl and ZIF&#8208;8 by simple physical milling and pyrolysis to obtain a metal&#8208;free porous electrocatalyst doped with Cl (mf&#8208;pClNC). The mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst exhibits a good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and high stability in alkaline electrolyte, exceeding most of the reported transition metal carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts and being comparable to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. Likewise, the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst also shows state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ORR activity and stability in acidic electrolyte. From experimental and theoretical calculations, the better ORR activity is most likely originated from the fact that the introduced Cl promotes the increase of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon, while the sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon and Cl together modify the electronic structure of the N&#8208;adjacent carbons, as the active sites, while NaCl molten&#8208;salt etching provides abundant paths for the transport of electrons/protons. Furthermore, the liquid rechargeable ZAB using the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode shows a fulfilling performance with a peak power density of 276.88&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable ZAB constructed with the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode exhibits an exciting performance both at low, high and room temperatures.

         <title>Enabling Carbonized Polymer Dots with Color&#8208;tunable Time&#8208;dependent Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Confining Carboxyl Dimer Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through confining carboxyl dimer association into carbonized polymer dots, its red room temperature phosphorescence was observed, which provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit. By hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl groups and promoting the formation of carboxyl dimer association, we realized the fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color from yellow to green to orange to green.







Abstract
Developing a facile strategy to realize fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color in time&#8208;dependent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is essential but both theoretically and practically rarely exploited. Through simultaneously confining carboxyl dimer association and isolated carboxyl into the particle via a simple hydrothermal treatment of polyacrylic acid, a dual&#8208;peak emission of red phosphorescence (645&#8197;nm) and green phosphorescence (550&#8197;nm) was observed from carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The ratio of the two luminescent species can be well regulated by hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl to promote hydrogen bond. Due to comparable but different lifetimes, color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP with color changing from yellow to green or orange to green were obtained. Based on the crosslinking enhanced emission effect, the phosphorescence visible time was even extended to 7&#8197;s through introducing polyethylenimide. This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP, but also provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.

         <title>Anchoring of Metal Complexes on Au25 Nanocluster for Enhanced Photocoupled Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring of metal complexes on an atomically precise Au25 nanocluster (NC) via a ligand exchange reaction provides an efficient electron&#8208;transfer pathway to improve the CO2 reduction activity and selectivity to CO in a wide potential range. Upon illumination, the current density could further be enhanced, and the hybrid system improves the stability of Au NCs by removing the excitation from the Au NCs under light.







Abstract
Atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) with discrete energy levels can be used as photosensitizers for CO2 reduction. However, tight ligand capping of Au NCs hinders CO2 adsorption on its active sites. Here, a new hybrid material is obtained by anchoring of thiol functionalized terpyridine metal complexes (metal=Ru, Ni, Fe, Co) on Au NCs by ligand exchange reactions (LERs). The anchoring of Ru and Ni complexes on Au25 NC (Au25&#8722;Ru and Au25&#8722;Ni) leads to adequate CO2 to CO conversion for photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (PECR) in terms of high selectivity, with Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) exceeding 90&#8201;% in a wide potential range, remarkable activity (CO production rate up to two times higher than that for pristine Au25PET18) and extremely large turnover frequencies (TOFs, 63012&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.97&#8197;V for Au25&#8722;Ru and 69989&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE for Au25&#8722;Ni). Moreover, PECR stability test indicates the excellent long&#8208;term stability of the modified NCs in contrast with pristine Au NCs. The present approach offers a novel strategy to enhance PECR activity and selectivity, as well as to improve the stability of Au NCs under light illumination, which paves the way for highly active and stable Au NCs catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based Catalysts by Tuning Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of low&#8208;cost and efficient transition&#8208;metal catalysts for low&#8208;temperature CO2 activation is significant and poses great challenges. Herein, a strategy via regulating the local electron density of active sites is developed to boost CO2 methanation that normally requires &gt;350 &#8451; for commercial Ni catalysts. An optimal Ni/ZrO2 catalyst affords an excellent low&#8208;temperature performance hitherto, with a CO2 conversion of 84.0%, CH4 selectivity of 98.6% even at 230 &#8451; and GHSV of 12,000 mL&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 for 106 h, reflecting one of the best CO2 methanation performance to date on Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Combined a series of in&#8208;situ spectroscopic characterization studies reveal that re&#8208;constructing monoclinic&#8208;ZrO2 supported Ni species with abundant oxygen vacancies can facilitate CO2 activation, owing to the enhanced local electron density of Ni induced by the strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings might be of great aid for construction of robust catalysts with an enhanced performance for CO2 emission abatement and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Empirical Model of Solvophobic Interactions in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects using N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances functionalized with non&#8208;polar alkyl groups. Solution studies and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed intramolecular alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions in their folded conformers. The structural modularity of the balances allowed systematic variation of alkyl group lengths. Control balances were instrumental in isolating weak organic solvophobic effects by eliminating framework solvent&#8208;solute effects. A 19F NMR label enabled analysis across 46 deuterated and non&#8208;deuterated solvent systems. Linear correlations were observed between organic solvophobic effects and solvent cohesive energy density (ced) as well as changes in solvent&#8208;accessible surface areas (SASA). Using these empirical relationships, a model was constructed to predict organic solvophobic interaction energy per unit area for any organic solvent with known CED values. The predicted interaction energies aligned with recent organic solvophobic measurements and literature values for the hydrophobic effect on non&#8208;polar surfaces confirmed the model's accuracy and utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Membranes based on Covalent Organic Frameworks through Green and Scalable Interfacial Polymerization using Ionic Liquids for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes featuring uniform topological structures and devisable functions, show huge potential in water purification and molecular separation. Nevertheless, the inability of uniform COF membranes to be produced on an industrial scale and their nonenvironmentally friendly fabrication method are the bottleneck preventing their industrial applications. Herein, we report a new green and industrially adaptable scraping&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) technique to fabricate scalable and uniform TpPa COF membranes. The process used non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;volatility ionic liquids (ILs) as organic phase instead of conventional organic solvents for interfacial synthesis of TpPa COF layer on a support membrane, which can simultaneously achieve the purposes of (i) improving the greenness of membrane&#8208;forming process and (ii) fabricating a robust membrane that can function beyond the conventional membranes. This approach yields a large&#8208;area, continuous COF membrane (19 &#215; 25 cm2) with a thickness of 78 nm within a brief period of 2 minutes. The resulting membrane exhibited an unprecedented combination of high permeance (48.09 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1) and antibiotic desalination efficiency (e.g., NaCl/adriamycin separation factor of 41.8), which is superior to the commercial benchmarking membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules with rich chemistry developed continuously over the past 100 years. Their helical, conjugated, and twisted structures make them attractive for constructing molecular systems. However, studies over the past century are mainly focused on synthesizing helicenes with increased numbers of aromatic rings and complex heterostructures, while research on inorganic, organic, and polymeric helicene materials is still embryonic. Herein, we report the first examples of helicene covalent organic frameworks, i.e., [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1, by condensing [7]helicene dialdehyde with trimethyl triazine via the C=C bond formation reaction under solvothermal conditions. The resultant [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits prominent X&#8208;ray diffraction peaks and assumes a highly ordered 2D lattice structure originated from the twisted configuration of [7]Helicene unit. The C=C linked [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 materials exhibited extended &#960; conjugation and broadly tuned their absorption, emission, redox activity, photoconductivity, and light&#8208;emitting activity, demonstrating rich multifunctionalities and great potentials in developing various applications. This work opens a way to a new family of COFs as well as helicene materials, enabling the exploration of unprecedented &#960; architectures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8208;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Comonomer Additive for Radically Recyclable Vinyl&#8208;derived Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radically&#8208;formed, vinyl&#8208;derived polymers account for over 30% of polymer production. Connected through stable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, these materials are notoriously challenging to chemically recycle. Herein, we report universal copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide (CAS) additive with multiple monomers under free&#8208;radical conditions, to introduce main&#8208;chain dynamic motifs. Backbone allyl sulfides undergo post&#8208;polymerization radical rearrangement via addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) that fosters both chain scission and extension. Scission is selectively induced through allyl sulfide exchange with small molecule thiyl radicals, resulting in oligomers as low as 14% of the initial molar mass. Crucially, oligomers retain allyl sulfide end groups, enabling their extension with monomer under radical conditions. Extended, i.e., recycled, product molar mass is tunable through the ratio of monomer to oligomer, and can surpass that of the initial copolymer. Two scission&#8208;extension cycles are demonstrated in copolymers with methyl methacrylate and styrene without escalation in dispersity. In illustration of forming higher&#8208;value products, i.e., upcycling, we synthesize block copolymers through the extension of oligomers with a different vinyl monomer. Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl&#8208;derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed&#8208;loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with hydrocarbons is of substantial interest and challenge. Herein, we achieved the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with up to 99&#8201;% ee in moderate to good yields, thus providing an elegant access to optically active carbonyl compounds. Density functional theory calculations suggest a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway.

The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99&#8201;% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88&#8201;% yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments were made to gain insight into the nature of C&#8722;C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.

&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric &#945;-alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with hydrocarbons is of substantial interest and challenge. Herein, we achieved the enantioselective oxidative cross-coupling of 2-acylimidazoles with up to 99&#8201;% ee in moderate to good yields, thus providing an elegant access to optically active carbonyl compounds.

         <title>Lignin Upconversion by Functionalization and Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides insights into up&#8208;conversion of lignin, which is a major byproduct of paper and pulp industries and has highly polyphenolic structure. Lignin can be functionalized through chemical and enzymatic routes to develop value&#8208;added chemicals for industries. Further, cross&#8208;linking strategies lead to the development of functional materials such as polymeric resins, bioplastics, hydrogels, nanocarriers and carbon fibers.







Abstract
Lignin, a complex and abundant biopolymer derived from plant cell walls, has emerged as a promising feedstock for sustainable material development. Due to the high abundance of phenylpropanoid units, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups, lignin is an ideal candidate for being explored in various material applications. Therefore, the demand on lignin valorization for development of value&#8208;added products is significantly increasing. This mini&#8208;review provides an overview of lignin upconversion, focusing on its functionalization through chemical and enzymatic routes, and its application in lignin&#8208;based polymer resins, hydrogels, and nanomaterials. The functionalization of lignin molecules with various chemical groups offers tailored properties and increased compatibility with other materials, expanding its potential applications. Additionally, the formation of lignin&#8208;based networks, either through cross&#8208;linking or blending with polymers, generates novel materials with improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. However, challenges remain in optimizing functionalization techniques, preserving the innate complexity of lignin, and achieving scalability for industrial implementation. As lignin&#8216;s potential continues to be unlocked, it is poised to contribute significantly to the shift towards more eco&#8208;friendly and resource&#8208;efficient industries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers present in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. However, only few catalytic enantioselective approaches have been established to access diaryl ether atropisomers. Herein, we report the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208;aryloxyisophthalaldehydes with aliphatic alcohols, phenol derivatives, and heteroaromatic amines. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The utility of this methodology is illustrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and diverse enantioretentive transformations. Control experiments and the DFT calculation support the association of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization with following kinetic resolution to enhance the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the Proximity and Distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs Sites for Direct Conversion of Methanol to Esters/Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of esters and aldehydes from methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol has been developed, allowing for customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the production of value&#8208;added methyl methacrylate (MMA), surpassing the current industrial processes to significantly lower the production costs.







Abstract
Methanol serves as a versatile building&#8208;block for various commodity chemicals, and the development of industrially promising strategies for its conversion remains the ultimate goal in methanol chemistry. In this study, we design a dual Cu&#8722;Cs catalytic system that enables a one&#8208;step direct conversion of methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol into high value&#8208;added esters/aldehydes, with customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. Cu&#8722;Cs at a millimeter&#8208;scale intimacy triggers methanol dehydrogenation and condensation, involving proton transfer, aldol formation, and aldol condensation, to obtain unsaturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 76.3&#8201;% and 31.1&#8201;%, respectively. Cu&#8722;Cs at a micrometer&#8208;scale intimacy significantly promotes mass transfer of intermediates across catalyst interfaces and their subsequent hydrogenation to saturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 67.6&#8201;% and 93.1&#8201;%, respectively. Conversely, Cu&#8722;Cs at a nanometer&#8208;scale intimacy alters reaction pathway with a similar energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step, but blocks the acidic&#8208;basic sites and diverts the reaction to byproducts. More importantly, an unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is achieved by further tailoring Cu and Cs distribution across the reaction bed in the configuration of Cu&#8722;Cs||Cs, outperforming the existing industrial processes and saving at least 15&#8201;% of production costs.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanocores Initiated Construction of Smart DNA&#8208;Polymer Microgels with Programmable and Regulable Functions and Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Locomotion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization reaction of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nanoparticles under sonication allows the construction of smart core/shell microgels. Multifunctional DNA microgels with tunable properties were prepared by introducing different vinyl monomers and functional DNA structures and controlling the polymerization process. The photothermal effect of LM NPs also contributed to the NIR&#8208;driven motion of these smart microgels.







Abstract
Due to their sequence&#8208;directed functions and excellent biocompatibility, smart DNA microgels have attracted considerable research interest, and the combination of DNA microgels with functional nanostructures can further expand their applications in biosensing and biomedicine. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) exhibiting both fluidic and metallic properties hold great promise for the development of smart soft materials; in particular, LM particles upon sonication can mediate radical&#8208;initiated polymerization reactions, thus allowing the combination of LMs and polymeric matrix to construct &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; materials. Herein, by forming active surfaces under sonication, LM nanoparticles (LM NPs) initiated localized radical polymerization reactions allow the combination of functional DNA units and different polymeric backbones to yield multifunctional core/shell microgels. The localized polymerization reaction allows fine control of the microgel compositions, and smart DNA microgels with tunable catalytic activities can be constructed. Moreover, due to the excellent photothermal effect of LM NPs, the resulting temperature gradient between microgels and surrounding solution upon NIR light irradiation can drive the oriented locomotion of the microgels, and remote control of the activity of these smart microgels can be achieved. These microgels may hold promise for various applications, such as the development of in vivo and in vitro biosensing and drug delivery systems.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Alkylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides with Conjugated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild electrocatalytic system is reported for the reductive alkylation of primary, secondary, or tertiary alkyl chlorides with conjugated alkenes.







Abstract
Reactions of unactivated alkyl chlorides under mild and sustainable conditions are rare compared to those of alkyl bromides or iodides. As a result, synthetic methods capable of modifying the vast chemical space of chloroalkane reagents, wastes, and materials are limited. We report the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive addition of unactivated alkyl chlorides to conjugated alkenes. Co&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkyl chlorides is performed under electroreductive conditions, and the resulting reactions constitute formal alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond formation. In addition to developing an operationally simple methodology, detailed mechanistic studies provide insights into the elementary steps of a proposed catalytic cycle. In particular, we propose a switch in the mechanism of C&#8722;Cl bond activation from nucleophilic substitution to halogen atom abstraction, which is critical for efficiently generating alkyl radicals. These mechanistic insights were leveraged in designing ligands that enable couplings of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Electroreductive Alkylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides with Conjugated Olefins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mild electrocatalytic system is reported for the reductive alkylation of primary, secondary, or tertiary alkyl chlorides with conjugated alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions of unactivated alkyl chlorides under mild and sustainable conditions are rare compared to those of alkyl bromides or iodides. As a result, synthetic methods capable of modifying the vast chemical space of chloroalkane reagents, wastes, and materials are limited. We report the cobalt-catalyzed reductive addition of unactivated alkyl chlorides to conjugated alkenes. Co-catalyzed activation of alkyl chlorides is performed under electroreductive conditions, and the resulting reactions constitute formal alkyl-alkyl bond formation. In addition to developing an operationally simple methodology, detailed mechanistic studies provide insights into the elementary steps of a proposed catalytic cycle. In particular, we propose a switch in the mechanism of C&#8722;Cl bond activation from nucleophilic substitution to halogen atom abstraction, which is critical for efficiently generating alkyl radicals. These mechanistic insights were leveraged in designing ligands that enable couplings of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking a Dual&#8208;Channel Pathway in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Single&#8208;Site Zirconium on Amorphous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a Cu/Zr&#8208;SiO2 catalyst, the interface between Cu and single&#8208;site Zr stabilized by a SiO2 matrix promotes a reverse water&#8208;gas shift + CO&#8208;hydro pathway. The additional pathway supplements the transitional formate pathway on ZrO2 particles during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into methanol on a large scale is of great significance in the sustainable methanol economy. Zirconia species are considered to be an essential support in Cu&#8208;based catalysts due to their excellent properties for CO2 adsorption and activation. However, the evolution of Zr species during the reaction and the effect of their structure on the reaction pathways remain unclear. Herein, single&#8208;site Zr species in an amorphous SiO2 matrix are created by enhancing the Zr&#8722;Si interaction in Cu/ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the coordination environment of single&#8208;site Zr is sensitive to the atmosphere and reaction conditions. We demonstrate that the CO2 adsorption occurs preferably on the interface of Cu and single&#8208;site Zr rather than on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Methanol synthesis in reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS)+CO&#8208;hydro pathway is verified only over single&#8208;dispersed Zr sites, whereas the ordinary formate pathway occurs on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Thus, it expands a non&#8208;competitive parallel pathway as a supplement to the dominant formate pathway, resulting in the enhancement of Cu activity sixfold and twofold based on Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The establishment of this dual&#8208;channel pathway by single&#8208;site Zr species in this work opens new horizons for understanding the role of atomically dispersed oxides in catalysis science.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement Enables A Triple Functionalization of Gem&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes: An Unusual Fluorolactonization Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor provides fluorolactones via a sequence of 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation, Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination.







Abstract
We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8722;C, one C&#8722;O and one tertiary C&#8722;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single disease biomarker, a two&#8208;photon fluorescence probe which is turned on sequentially by &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and HBrO was designed to predict early atherosclerotic plaques. The voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed at the cellular level, demonstrating that both GGT and HBrO can be applied as biomarkers of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse atherosclerosis or existing plaques. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which is accompanied by an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzes the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes has been realized, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile. Detailed mechanistic studies have been explored by experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
Axially chiral open&#8208;chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile (&#916;G&#8800;(rac)=26.6&#8211;28.0&#8197;kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline N&#8208;oxide system reveal that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6&#8208;diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the arene C&#8722;H bond and the Rh&#8722;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8722;C reductive elimination being enantio&#8208;determining and turnover&#8208;limiting. The DFT&#8208;established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies. The coupled products of quinoline N&#8208;oxides undergo facile visible light&#8208;induced intramolecular oxygen&#8208;atom transfer, affording chiral epoxides with complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgF is capable of converting the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion into a novel silver enolate&#8208;fluorophosphorane species, which enables the development of (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine via P(III)/P(V) catalysis. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study has demonstrated that the silver enolate moiety offers an alternative approach to realize an asymmetric variant merely by the introduction of an additional chiral PyBox ligand.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising of silver enolate and a fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo a Mannich reaction with aldimine, whereas the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at an asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of an achiral phosphine catalyst and a chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensionally arranged quantum&#8208;dot superstructure has been created by using a supramolecular polymer template composed of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cholesterol derivatives. This superstructure is not obtained by the self&#8208;assembly of the quantum dots in the absence of the template. The closely arranged quantum dots allows efficient energy transfer between them.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives containing two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing the SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures through van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna (PAnt) specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions and act as an exchangeable dye, aiming at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex exhibited an exceptional photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, marking a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging.







Abstract
Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.

         <title>Modulating Skeletons of Covalent Organic Framework for High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeleton engineering was used to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diarylamine derivatives and ionized skeletons, thus overcoming the weak binding ability of Au ions, giving gold adsorbents with high selectivity and uptakes. Experiments and theoretical calculations show that the transition of binding sites from C=N bonds to ionic amine sites, thereby avoiding the protonation process, contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine&#8208;linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90&#8201;% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63&#8197;times of that from the charge&#8208;neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, exceptional selectivity (97.45&#8201;%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl4&#8722; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state battery based on Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode, Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 solid electrolyte and GaN&#8208;modified Li anode. The assembled Li symmetric cell shows quite low interfacial resistance and great interfacial stability, and the full battery shows a high initial capacity, a high capacity retention, a high rate capability and a significantly mitigated voltage decay demonstrating a great potential in high energy density solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8722;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000&#8197;h at 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96&#8197;mV/cycle to only 0.66&#8197;mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (&#8776;170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.

The assembled Li symmetric cell shows quite low interfacial resistance and great interfacial stability, and the full battery shows a high initial capacity, a high capacity retention, a high rate capability and a significantly mitigated voltage decay demonstrating a great potential in high energy density solid-state battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries (SSBs) based on Li-rich Mn-based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three-dimensional foam-structured GaN&#8722;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high-performance SSB based on Co-free Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and Li&lt;sub&gt;6.5&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000&#8197;h at 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96&#8197;mV/cycle to only 0.66&#8197;mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (&#8776;170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte-based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte-based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high-performance LRMO-based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high-energy density SSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized acceptor has been synthesized to show extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low solubility, high glass transition temperature, and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels, leading to over 19% efficiency and highly stable ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits have enabled the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70&#8201;&#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600&#8197;hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional customizability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted significant interest for function&#8208;oriented materials design. Recent advances in functionalization strategies and constructing COF&#8208;based therapeutic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy are highlighted, and some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are discussed to promote the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines.







Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; strategy was demonstrated to construct highly ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;loaded MMM with quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous channels for rapid CO2 transportation.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55&#8197;wt&#8201;%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF crystallization: the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Discorhabdin V
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V was accomplished through a highly convergent strategy enabled by scalable access to the two key components. This highly selective asymmetric approach to nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdins lays the foundation for access to this class of natural products.







Abstract
The discorhabdin natural products are a large subset of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids with a myriad of biological activities. Despite garnering much synthetic attention, few members have thus far been completed, particularly those featuring a bridging carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond that is found in numerous discorhabdins, including discorhabdin V. Herein we report the first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V. To access the pyrroloiminoquinone we developed a convergent N&#8208;alkylation/oxidative aminocyclization/bromination cascade that joins two key components, which are both made on multigram scale. An intramolecular Heck reaction then forms the quaternary carbon center in an intermediate containing the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bridge, and a reductive N,O&#8208;acetal cyclization sequence introduces the final piperidine ring. Furthermore, we have established the relative configuration of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V through experimental NOESY data and DP4 NMR probability calculations. The absolute configuration of the natural product has also been determined by circular dichroism and the use of an amino acid derived chiral starting material. Our work represents one of only two reports of a total synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdin and paves the way for future biological evaluation of such compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Metallacycle for Orthogonal Multimode Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system with spatially controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer has been built through the incorporation of a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle and a photochromic spiropyran derivative. This approach enables the realization of orthogonal multimode photopatterning including holographic, fluorescent, and photochromic patterning in one integrated system.







Abstract
The development of multimode photopatterning systems based on supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) is considerably attractive in supramolecular chemistry and materials science, because SCCs can serve as promising platforms for the incorporation of multiple functional building blocks. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle that is constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. By exploiting its fascinating liquid crystal features, bright emission properties, and facile photocyclization capability, a unique system with spatially&#8208;controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) is built through the introduction of a photochromic spiropyran derivative, which led to the realization of the first example of a liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle for orthogonal photopatterning in three&#8208;modes, namely holography, fluorescence, and photochromism.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Gating of Selective Bacterial Membrane Interaction and Enhanced Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photoswitchable bio&#8208;interface through ligand functionalization on #2D&#8208;MoS2, achieving differential&#8208;interactions&#8208;based #Gram&#8208;selective antibacterial activity that enables effective wound healing applications. @MrinmoyGroup @funbiomats @iiscbangalore







Abstract
Reversible biointerfaces are essential for on&#8208;demand molecular recognition to regulate stimuli&#8208;responsive bioactivity such as specific interactions with cell membranes. The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells. Herein, we introduce a 2D&#8208;MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene that interacts selectively with either Gram&#8208;positive or Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a light&#8208;gated fashion. The trans conformation (trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) selectively kills Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2), under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive strains. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits higher affinity towards the membrane of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria compared to trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2. In case of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 and generates intracellular ROS to kill the bacteria. While the trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram&#8208;negative bacterial cells, cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H&#8208;bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo&#8208;controlled Gram&#8208;selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain&#8208;specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration, 0.65&#8197;&#956;g/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain&#8208;selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Polymerization Landscape by Lipid Mesophase Soft Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic synthesis of dextran in lipidic mesophase catalyzed by the enzyme dextransucrase DSR&#8208;M not only yields polymers at 30&#8201;&#176;C that are six times longer than in bulk solution at identical concentrations of reactants, but also allows the reaction to be carried out in subzero liquid water at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Soft nanoconfinement can increase chemical reactivity in nature and has therefore led to considerable interest in transferring this universal feature to artificial biological systems. However, little is known about the underlying principles of soft nanoconfinement responsible for the enhancement of biochemical reactions. Herein we demonstrate how enzymatic polymerization can be expanded, optimized, and engineered when carried out under soft nanoconfinement mediated by lipidic mesophases. By systematically varying the water content in the mesophase and thus the diameter of the confined water nanochannels, we show higher efficiency, turnover rate, and degrees of polymerization as compared to the bulk aqueous solution, all controlled by soft nanoconfinement effects. Furthermore, we exploit the unique properties of unfreezing soft nanoconfined water to perform the first enzymatic polymerization at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in pure aqueous media. These results underpin lipidic mesophases as a versatile host system for chemical reactions and promote them as an original and unexplored platform for enzymatic polymerization.

         <title>Umpolung Isomerization in Radical Copolymerization of Benzyl Vinyl Ether with Pentafluorophenylacrylate Leading to Degradable AAB Periodic Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical copolymerzation of benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE; A) with the highly electron&#8208;deficient acrylate monomer pentafluorophenylacrylate (PFA; B) progressed with unique backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE unit. The isomerization caused the umpolung of the growing species, leading to a periodic consumption in the order AAB, and consequently the copolymer resulting after post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) was degradable under acidic conditions.







Abstract
This study revealed that benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows a peculiar isomerization propagation in its radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying a pentafluorophenyl group (PFA). The co&#8208;monomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in the electron density. However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving a benzyl radical species prior to propagation with BnVE. The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of the growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA. Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11=0.174 and r21=6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups by post&#8208;polymerization alcoholysis and aminolysis modifications. The unique isomerization in the AAB sequence allowed the periodic introduction of a benzyl ether structure in the backbone leading to efficient degradation under acid conditions.

         <title>Diversification of a Novel &#945;&#8208;Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines</title>

Please use in Twitter the title with the names of the two final authors: &#8220;Diversification of a Novel &#945;&#8208;Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines (Daniel G. Rivera and B. Westermann)&#8221;.







Abstract
The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;&#8208;galactosyl ceramide (&#945;&#8208;GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B&#8208;cell activation. Herein, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;&#8208;GalCer skeleton, namely the N&#8208;substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen&#8208;specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered by either the parenteral or the mucosal route, as compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogues showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogue previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.

Please use in Twitter the title with the names of the two final authors: &#8220;Diversification of a Novel &#945;-Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines (Daniel G.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;-galactosyl ceramide (&#945;-GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B-cell activation. Herein, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;-GalCer skeleton, namely the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self-adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen-specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered by either the parenteral or the mucosal route, as compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;-GalCer analogues showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;-GalCer analogue previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the relationship between confined space and product selectivity, a wrinkle structure was used as a model for confined spaces. The shape and dimension of the wrinkle can be systematically controlled at nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. The systematic control of the wrinkle model has revealed that the selectivities for CH4, C2H4, and EtOH are influenced differently by the shape and dimension of the confined space.







Abstract
The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH4, C2H4, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure. Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.

         <title>Tipping the Balance Between the bcc and fcc Phase Within the Alkali and Coinage Metal Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relativistic density functional calculations for the cuboidal phase transition show that small effects such as dispersion interactions and phonon contributions can tip the balance between the body&#8208;centered and face&#8208;centered cubic structures shedding light into the difference between the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
Why the Group&#8197;1 elements crystallize in the body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure, and the iso&#8208;electronic Group&#8197;11 elements in the face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure, remains a mystery. Here we show that a delicate interplay between many&#8208;body effects, vibrational contributions and dispersion interactions obtained from relativistic density functional theory offers an answer to this long&#8208;standing controversy. It also sheds light on the Periodic Table of Crystal Structures. A smooth diffusionless transition through cuboidal lattices gives a detailed insight into the bcc&#8594;fcc phase transition for the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements.

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free protocol for Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;Nucleophiles using nontoxic, solid allyl trimethylammonium chloride as alternative allylating agent is presented. This method features fast reaction kinetics, very low catalyst loadings, high yields, mild conditions, and high functional group tolerance. Its potential for late&#8208;stage modifications of bioactive compounds is demonstrated through multiple examples.







Abstract
We present the first solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical protocol for a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation. This approach features exceptionally low catalyst loadings (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (&lt;90&#8197;min), and a simple setup, eliminating the need for air or moisture precautions, making the process highly efficient and environmentally benign. We introduce solid, nontoxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle allyl trimethylammonium salts as valuable alternative to volatile or hazardous reagents. Our approach enables the allylation of various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles in yields up to 99&#8201;% even for structurally complex bioactive compounds, owing to its mild conditions and exceptional functional group tolerance.

         <title>Paired Electrosynthesis of Formaldehyde Derivatives from CO2 Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing CO2&#8208;derived formaldehyde&#8208;derivatives for fuel additive or polymer synthesis is a promising approach to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions. Existing methodologies involve converting CO2 to methanol by thermal hydrogenation, followed by electrochemical or thermochemical oxidation to produce formaldehyde. Adding to the conventional methanol oxidation pathway, we propose a new electrochemical approach to simultaneously generate formaldehyde&#8208;derivatives at both electrodes by partial methanol oxidation and the direct reduction of CO2. To achieve this, a method to directly reduce CO2 to formaldehyde at the cathode is required. Still, it has been scarcely reported previously due to the acidity of the formic acid intermediate and the facile over&#8208;reduction of formaldehyde to methanol. By enabling the activation and subsequent stabilization of formic acid and formaldehyde respectively in methanol solvent, we were able to implement a strategy where formaldehyde derivatives were generated at the cathode alongside the anode. Further mechanism studies revealed that protons supplied from the anodic reaction contribute to the activation of formic acid and the stabilization of the formaldehyde product. Additionally, it was found that the cathodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency can be further increased through prolonged electrolysis time up to 50% along with a maximum anodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency of 90%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic cell vaccine (DCV) holds great potential in tumor immunotherapy owing to its potent ability in eliciting tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. Aiming at engineering enhanced DCV, we report the first effort to construct a glycopolymer&#8208;engineered DC vaccine (G&#8208;DCV) via metabolic cell surface sugar engineering and copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry. Model G&#8208;DCV was prepared by firstly delivering tumor antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) into dendritic cells (DC) with fluoroalkane&#8208;grafted polyethyleneimines, followed by conjugating glycopolymers with a terminal group of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) onto dendritic cells. Compared to unmodified DCV, our G&#8208;DCV could induce stronger T cell activation due to the enhanced adhesion between DCs and T cells. Notably, such G&#8208;DCV could more effectively inhibit the growth of the mouse B16&#8208;OVA (expressing OVA antigen) tumor model after adoptive transfer. Moreover, by combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, G&#8208;DCV shows further increased anti&#8208;tumor effects in treating different tumor models. Thus, our work provides a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of DC vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transport electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Here, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP.&#160;Based on the discovery of two&#160;clpP&#160;genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in&#160;Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods&#160;in vitro.&#160;Synthesis of semi&#8208;synthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in&#160;S. aureus&#160;cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from&#160;S. aureus,&#160;Aquifex aeolicus,&#160;as well as&#160;Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the pioneering group of ClpP inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Click to Self&#8208;immolation: A &#8220;Click&#8221; Functionalization Strategy towards Triggerable Self&#8208;immolative Homopolymers and Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are a class of degradable macromolecules that undergo stimuli&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerization. However, a general approach to readily end&#8208;functionalize SIP precursors for programmed degradation remains elusive, restricting access to complex, functional SIP&#8208;based materials. Here we present a &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; strategy based on aroyl azide&#8208;capped SIP precursors, enabling the facile construction of diverse SIPs with different trigger units through a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol/thiol&#8722;isocyanate &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. This strategy is also applied to polymer&#8722;polymer coupling to access fully depolymerizable block copolymer amphiphiles, even combining different SIP backbones. Our results demonstrate that the depolymerization can be actuated efficiently under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions by the removal of the trigger units and ensuing self&#8208;immolation of the p&#8208;aminobenzyl carbonate linkage, indicating promise for controlled release applications involving nanoparticles and hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Redox Reactions Enable Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ poses an inherent challenge that limits the efficiency and stability of tin&#8208;lead mixed (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices. In this work, we discover the sustainable redox reactions enabling self&#8208;healing Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, where their intractable oxidation degradation can be recovered to their original state under light soaking. Quantitative and operando spectroscopies are used to investigate the redox chemistry, revealing that metallic Pb0 from the photolysis of perovskite reacts with Sn4+ to regenerate Pb2+ and Sn2+ spontaneously. Given the sluggish redox reaction kinetics, V3+/V2+ ionic pair is designed as an effective redox shuttle to accelerate the recovery of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites from oxidation. The target Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs enabled by V3+/V2+ ionic pair deliver an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.22% and excellent device lifespan, retaining nearly 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking under light for 1,000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in&#8208;situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1). Detailed experiments together with in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108 p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10 &#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05 W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth of 6 cm thickness. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048 mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues.Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X = Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity.This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in&#8208;situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanoinhibitor Targeting cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Reverse the Homeostatic Imbalance of Inflammation in Psoriasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by dysregulated crosstalk between immune cells and keratinocytes. Here we show that the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator of psoriatic inflammation in a mouse model. Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) were designed to inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. By inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages was reduced, and the proinflammatory cytokines&#8208;induced breakdown of immunological tolerance and overexpression of chemokines in keratinocytes was restored, which reversed the homeostatic imbalance through breaking these cytokines&#8208;mediated intercellular positive feedback loop. Topical Pt&#8208;CDs treatment exhibited therapeutic effects in imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mice without noticeable toxicity. The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt&#8208;CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning on Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Photo&#8208;Oxidation by Outer&#8208;Sphere Microenvironment Modulation in Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is ubiquitously involved in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, efficient and selective production of 1O2 is still challenging. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nickel porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating functional groups with different electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing features on their pore walls. These functional groups established a dedicated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment surrounding the Ni catalytic center that tunes the activity of the COFs for 1O2&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation. With the increase of the electron&#8208;donating ability of functional groups, the modulated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment turns on the catalytic activity from a yield of nearly zero by the cyano group functionalized COF to an excellent yield of 98% by the methoxy group functionalized one. Electronic property investigation and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the distinct excitonic behaviors attributed to the diverse band energy levels and orbital composition are responsible for the discriminative activity. This study represents the first regulation of generating reactive oxygen species based on the strategy of outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment modulation in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8208;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8208;S bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO&#8322;RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO&#8322;&#160;solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment&#160;by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The superhydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C&#8322;H&#8324;) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5 times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO&#8322;RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas&#8208;conversion electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8208;, Mo6O228&#8208; and Mo7O258&#8208;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8208;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster.  The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg  produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6 V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805; 4.4 V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6 V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4% capacity retention after 130 cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Photo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fluorinated Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) polymers with tailored structures are highly desirable for the outstanding properties. In this work, we developed a novel photoorganocatalyzed controlled radical alternating copolymerizations of fluoroalkyl maleimide and diverse vinyl comonomers, enabling efficient preparation of fluorinated copolymers of predetermined UHMWs and well&#8208;defined structures at high conversions. Versatility of this method was demonstrated by expanding to controlled terpolymerization, which allows facial access toward fluorinated terpolymers of UHMWs and functional pendants. The obtained copolymers exhibited attractive physical properties and furnished thermoplastic, anticorrosive and (super)hydrophobic attributes as coatings on different substrates. Molecular simulations provided insights into the coating morphology, which unveiled a fluorous protective layer on the top surface with polar groups attached to the bottom substrate, resulting in good adhesion and hydrophobicity, simultaneously. This synthetic method and customized copolymers shed light on the design of high&#8208;performance coatings by macromolecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Indoles via Carbene Catalyzed Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with a variety of ring sizes (10&#8208;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.</dc:description>

We developed an indirect methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98%). After glycosylation, p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by the free radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route for the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPS from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08 was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of&#160;phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.</dc:description>

Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of&#160;phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Based Nanoflow Cytometry Method for the Molecular Detection and Classification of Ovarian Cancers through Profiling of Tumor Markers on Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular profiling of protein markers on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is a promising strategy for the precise detection and classification of ovarian cancers. However, this strategy is challenging owing to the lack of simple and practical detection methods. In this work, using an aptamer&#8208;based nanoflow cytometry (nFCM) detection strategy, a simple and rapid method for the molecular profiling of multiple protein markers on sEVs was developed. The protein markers can be easily labeled with aptamer probes and then rapidly profiled by nFCM. Seven cancer&#8208;associated protein markers, including&#160;CA125, STIP1, CD24, EpCAM, EGFR, MUC1, and HER2, on plasma sEVs were profiled for the molecular detection and classification of ovarian cancers. Profiling these seven protein markers enabled the precise detection of ovarian cancer with a high accuracy of 94.2%. In addition, combined with machine learning algorithms, such&#160;as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), the molecular classifications of ovarian cancer cell lines and subtypes were achieved with overall accuracies of 82.9% and 55.4%, respectively. Therefore, this simple, rapid, and non&#8208;invasive method exhibited&#160;considerable potential for the auxiliary diagnosis and molecular classification of ovarian cancers in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and their divergent further transformations have been established. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized. The intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage was supported by DFT calculations in both catalytic systems.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. Density functional theory calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitchable Benzimidazole Azo&#8208;Arenes as &#946;&#8208;Arrestin2&#8208;Biased Selective Cannabinoid 2 Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable scaffold was developed based on the &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; of benzimidazole: 2&#8208;benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes. This scaffold was used for the development of functionally selective cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) ligands with &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) bias. Compound 10&#8201;d acts as a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;efficacy switch in &#946;arr2&#8208;mediated endocytosis and can be used to investigate the CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 endocytic pathway.







Abstract
The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway&#8208;selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable scaffold based on the privileged structure of benzimidazole and its application as a functionally selective CB2R &#8220;efficacy&#8208;switch&#8221;. Benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes offer huge potential for the broad extension of photopharmacology to a wide range of optically addressable biological targets. We used this scaffold to develop compound 10&#8201;d, a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221; agonist, which serves as a molecular probe to study the &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) pathway at CB2R. &#946;&#913;rr2 bias was observed in CB2R internalization and &#946;arr2 recruitment, while no activation occurred when looking at G&#945;16 or mini&#8208;G&#945;i. Overall, compound 10&#8201;d is the first light&#8208;dependent functionally selective agonist to investigate the complex mechanisms of CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 dependent endocytosis.

         <title>Streamlined Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Loop Mimicry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Matching (BM) evaluates virtual libraries of cyclic peptidomimetics containing an organic fragment, for interface loop mimicry in protein&#8208;protein interactions. It does so by comparing their backbone conformers with interface loops on the protein ligand. Hits for iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2 and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR were validated experimentally.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets. Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries. Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation. BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10&#8197;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2, and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR.

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed for building two types of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes via the phosphonium salt catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael reaction together with copper salt enabled aromatization. The scalability and practicality of this protocol were validated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and transformation of products, particularly towards producing novel helical phosphine ligands that were successfully utilized in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation between selenonium salts and selenides can be easily achieved by adding alkylation reagents to the selenide compounds. By incorporating selenonium salts into polyurethane networks, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as solvent and creep resistance at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8722;O clusters&#8208;based supraclusters presenting multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded porous assemblies can offer outstanding catalysis ability both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases. The supracluster proposed here will build a bridge between &#8220;supramolecule&#8221; and &#8220;supraparticle&#8221;, and provide new perspectives for synthesizing zeolite&#8208;like materials.







Abstract
Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites. By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8722;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O solution, structural and chemical properties of supported metal oxide species can be controlled because of dissolution&#8208;recrystallization of amorphous or/and low&#8208;crystalline support in the parent catalyst. The method is applicable for tailoring the catalyst reducibility and thus its activity for C&#8722;H activation in hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8722;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing the pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8722;ZrO2&#8722;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayer was constructed on Pd nanoparticles in air at only 400&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting catalyst with non&#8208;metal active sites exhibited an exceptional resistance to poisoning by SO2 and H2O, yielding robust CO oxidation performance under 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O at temperatures as low as 120&#8201;&#176;C for at least 240&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21&#8197;vol&#8201;% O2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8208;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8722;S) bonding.

&lt;p&gt;The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real-working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide-metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres.

In particular, the core (Pd)-shell (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

         <title>Toward De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst Candidates for Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reactions

A method to discover new catalysts: We grow a reaction network for each catalyst template (Ci) and look for catalytic activity in each reaction network. The reactant (R) reacts with the catalyst template (Ci) and forms several intermediates (Ii) before reaching a product (P) with the catalyst template regenerated.







Abstract
Recently we have demonstrated how a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from random tertiary amines can be used to discover a new and efficient catalyst for the alcohol&#8208;mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction. In particular, the discovered catalyst was shown experimentally to be eight times more active than DABCO, commonly used to catalyze the MBH reaction. This represents a breakthrough in using generative models for catalyst optimization. However, the GA procedure, and hence discovery, relied on two important pieces of information; 1)&#8197;the knowledge that tertiary amines catalyze the reaction and 2)&#8197;the mechanism and reaction profile for the catalyzed reaction, in particular the transition state structure of the rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, truly de novo catalyst discovery must include these steps. Here we present such a method for discovering catalyst candidates for a specific reaction while simultaneously proposing a mechanism for the catalyzed reaction. We show that tertiary amines and phosphines are potential catalysts for the MBH reaction by screening 11 molecular templates representing common functional groups. The method relies on an automated reaction discovery workflow using meta&#8208;dynamics calculations. Combining this method for catalyst candidate discovery with our GA&#8208;based catalyst optimization method results in an algorithm for truly de novo catalyst discovery.

         <title>Aryne&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;N Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N arylation of easily accessible tertiary anilines enabled by bifunctional arynes is described. The reaction proceeds via a tandem nucleophilic attack of anilines to arynes, followed by a Smiles&#8208;Truce rearrangement to furnish synthetically valuable and densely substituted biaryls. This protocol was further utilized for heterocyclic scaffolds, providing access to medium size azaheterocycles via n+2 carbon insertion.







Abstract
Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8722;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysts or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;doped copper nitride is a highly selective electrocatalyst for CO reduction to n&#8208;propanol leading to a record Faradaic Efficiency value of 45&#8201;% at an industrially&#8208;relevant current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, in an alkaline flow electrolyser.







Abstract
The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradaic efficiency: 45&#8201;%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradaic efficiency: 80&#8201;%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aryl Shift and Double Alkyne Benzannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
If the occupied position on the heterocyclic core is exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, alkyne benzannulation occurs at this position with concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. The resulting slightly curved N&#8208;doped nanographenes possess an unprecedented combination of six fused aromatic rings and strong emission of yellow light.







Abstract
The tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron&#8208;rich character of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole scaffold, we demonstrate that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions&#8197;2 and 5 leading to a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;&#8208;expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13&#8197;products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the formation of the six&#8208;membered rings accompanied with a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is both kinetically and thermodynamically favourable over plausible formation of products containing 7&#8208;membered rings. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.

The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the formation of the six-membered rings accompanied with a 1,2-aryl shift is both kinetically and thermodynamically favourable over plausible formation of products containing 7-membered rings. Steady-state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S-shaped N-doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithienoazepine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes: Janus&#8208;Faced Effects of a Thiophene&#8208;Fused Structure on Antiaromatic Azepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine was employed as a key core of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The Janus&#8208;faced effect of the thiophene&#8208;fused structure, which enhances the antiaromaticity of the azepine ring and, at the same time, relieves the antiaromaticity through the deformation from the aromatic thiophene ring to the quinoidal thienyl moiety, is effective to attain the largely red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878&#8197;nm in solution.

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene, an organic electrode material with synergetic coupling effects of abundant redox&#8208;active sites and stable conjugated cores, via nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, delivers excellent rate capability, and robust cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs), valued for their sustainability and structural tunability, have been attracting increasing attention for wide application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and other rechargeable batteries. However, most OEMs are plagued with insufficient specific capacity or poor cycling stability. Therefore, it&#8242;s imperative to enhance their specific capacity and cycling stability through molecular design. Herein, we designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) by the synergetic coupling of catechol (the precursor of ortho&#8208;quinone)/ortho&#8208;quinone functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. The abundance of catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone and imine redox&#8208;active moieties delivers a high specific capacity of nine&#8208;electron transfer for SIBs. Most notably, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules secure the stable long&#8208;term cycling performance of SIBs. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (554&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73&#8201;% after 3000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in SIBs. Additionally, the nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism is confirmed by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculation, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), and Raman analysis. The achievement of the synergetic coupling of the redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs could be an important key to the enhancement of SIBs and other metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrocatalytic 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation of alkenes utilizing readily available materials in ambient conditions is developed. The protocol is widely applicable to aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with excellent faradaic efficiencies and yields of up to 96&#8201;%. The versatility of the method is expanded with alkenoic acids towards lactone derivatives and with other carboxylic acids like HCOOH.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87&#8201;%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular functionalization techniques are leveraged to anchor well&#8208;defined organometallic fragments on the surface of black phosphorus. The functionalized nanosheets feature a high density of metal sites, with discrete and robust M&#8722;P bonds that are stable to subsequent transformations. The Tolman electronic parameter and steric bulk of bP are also estimated relative to molecular phosphines.







Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is a scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;block copolymers with tunable microstructures were prepared and used as compatibilizer additives for upcycling mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was demonstrated to enable block extension during in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties and 3D printing capability.







Abstract
Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

         <title>An Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900&#8197;nm for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Multiplexed Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of novel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles in the whole near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) beyond 1700&#8197;nm. Inspired by the scattering and water absorption, we then defined the NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8197;nm&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window for high&#8208;resolution multiplexed imaging of lymph, blood vessels and intestines.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging. However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging. To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the conventional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. We developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852&#8197;nm to 2842&#8197;nm. NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L nanoprobes enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi&#8208;channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high&#8208;contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.

         <title>Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolite with highly complete framework was synthesized via protozeolite seeding. The protozeolite provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared zeolite presented excellent performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction.







Abstract
Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite&#8208;seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 443.9&#8197;hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92&#8201;% at a WHSV of 2&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite&#8208;seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via matching S cathodes in aqueous Cu2+ ion&#8208;based electrolyte and Li anodes in organic electrolyte. The Li||S hybrid batteries deliver a high discharge voltage and satisfactory capacity, contributing to incredible energy density.







Abstract
Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4&#8197;V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X&#8208;ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H2O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X-ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation-induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) based on aptamer&#8208;functionalized Au nanoparticles (&#8220;islands&#8221;) and fluid fluorescent aptamer ligands (&#8220;rafts&#8221;) was engineered on a microfluidic chip surface. HieFluidFace allowed to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions via spatiotemporal regulation of ligand distribution, and was used for efficient capture and direct identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples.







Abstract
In nature, regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors and ligands leads to optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics of receptor&#8211;ligand binding reactions within interfaces. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each aptamer&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticle, termed spherical aptamer (SAPT), is anchored on a supported lipid bilayer without fluidity, like an &#8220;island&#8221;, and is surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity, like &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;rafts&#8221; model provides a large reactive cross&#8208;section for rapid binding to cellular receptors. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomedicine was designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) against glioma (GBM). Upon intravenous injection, the nanomedicine penetrated the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulated within the TME of GBM&#8208;bearing mice, which subsequently abolished the negative feedback regulation function of SOCS1 on dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, elicited strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibited tumor growth.







Abstract
Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved the outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) was associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and developed a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silenced SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggered strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a peptide, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. The nanomedicine concentrated on the TME in vivo, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate the TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymers, like covalent organic frameworks, are promising materials for a wide variety of applications. However, unlike conventional polymers, they are challenging to mold, shape, or process. Here we show how insoluble COFs, functionalized with oligoether sidechains, can be solution cast into high&#8208;dielectric films, with excellent flexibility and mechanical strength.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young's modulus of 391.7&#8197;MPa and 1034.7&#8197;MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoclusters with reversible pH responsiveness have been developed by the incorporation of tertiary amine groups in the surface ligands. The amine groups change the highest occupied molecular orbital upon their pH&#8208;induced protonation and deprotonation, resulting in photoluminescence quenching.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.

Photo-induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au-S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH-responsive NIR-emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non-invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Auxiliary Approach for Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes and alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with chiral auxiliaries has been developed, affording, after hydrolysis, synthetically challenging enantioenriched ketones. This chiral auxiliary approach is an alternative to the use of complex chiral catalysts in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclizations.







Abstract
Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6] as catalyst. First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones. Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by an Evans&#8208;type oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was selected to remove the auxiliary to give enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.

         <title>UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Harvesting Conjugated Porous Polymer Nanocomposite: Upconversion and Plasmon Expedited Thioether Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized upconversion nanoparticles are covalently linked to conjugated porous organic polymers, followed by the loading of gold nanoparticles to form a UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorbing photocatalyst, UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The synergistic influence of plasmon absorption and upconversion luminescence improves photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including the detoxification of chemical warfare agents under natural sunlight and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysts capable of harvesting a broad range of the solar spectrum are essential for sustainable chemical transformations and environmental remediation. Herein, we have integrated NIR&#8208;absorbing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) with UV&#8208;Vis absorbing conjugated porous organic polymer (POP) through the in situ multicomponent C&#8722;C coupling to fabricate a UC&#8722;POP nanocomposite. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of UC&#8722;POP is further augmented by loading plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNP) into UC&#8722;POP. A three&#8208;times enhancement in the upconversion luminescence is observed upon the incorporation of AuNP in UC&#8722;POP, subsequently boosting the photocatalytic activity of UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigations infer the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including mustard gas simulant by UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au compared to POP and UC&#8722;POP due to the facile electron&#8208;hole pair generation, suppressed exciton recombination, and efficient charge carrier migration. Thus, the unique design strategy of combining plasmonic and upconversion nanoparticles with a conjugated porous organic polymer opens up new vistas towards artificial light harvesting.

         <title>Green Ether Electrolytes for Sustainable High&#8208;voltage Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green ether solvent is reported through a rational design of carbon chain regulation that tunes steric hindrance for an efficient solvation structure. Such a structure significantly reduces the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity, and the tuned solvation structure results in sustainable high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64&#8201;%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.

Six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in aqueous electrolytes. The unique energy storage mechanism leads to high capacity and potential of I2 electrodes, contributing to enhanced energy density of corresponding aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8722;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8722; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.

Benefiting from optimized crystal packing, favourable morphology and ordered molecular arrangement, A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based binary organic solar cells yield a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% and low energy loss among selenium&#8208;containing acceptors.







Abstract
Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider band gap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1&#8201;:&#8201;A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;%, which represents the record value for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Benzonitriles on BiOBr Nanosheets Promoted by Vacancy Associates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOBr photocatalysts with different surface vacancy associates were successfully synthesized. Vacancy associates of Br&#8722;Bi&#8722;Br triple atom vacancy (VBrBiBr) and oxygen vacancies can generate benzonitrile with high selectivity in the photocatalytic ammoxidation of benzyl alcohol by providing adsorption activation sites for NH3 and O2 and reaction sites for the multi&#8208;step formation of imine intermediates and oxidation to benzonitrile.







Abstract
Photocatalytic organic functionalization reactions represent a green, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable synthesis route for value&#8208;added chemicals. However, heterogeneous photocatalysis is inefficient in directly activating ammonia molecules for the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrogenous organic products when compared with oxygen activation in the formation of related oxygenated compounds. In this study, we report the heterogeneous photosynthesis of benzonitriles by the ammoxidation of benzyl alcohols (99&#8201;% conversion, 93&#8201;% selectivity) promoted using BiOBr nanosheets with surface vacancy associates. In contrast, the main reaction of catalysts with other types of vacancy sites is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde or benzoic acid. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have demonstrated a specificity of vacancy type with respect to product selectivity, which arises from the adsorption and activation of NH3 and O2 that is required to promote subsequent C&#8722;N coupling and oxidation to nitrile. This study provides a better understanding of the role of vacancies as catalytic sites in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalyst achieves high electronic selectivity for CH4 and facile separation of H2O2 in non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions with only CO2 and H2O. This exceptional performance is attributed to a long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited electron acceptor, promoting the formation of a stabilized five&#8208;member&#8208;ring cyclic intermediate with lower energy, leading to an 90&#8201;% selectivity for the eight&#8208;electron product CH4.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach towards enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of Bi&#8208;based catalysts was demonstrated via the L&#8208;histidine incorporation. The improved CO2 chemical adsorption and electron&#8208;rich nature of resultant catalysts enables high Faradaic efficiency for formate production in an ultra&#8208;wide potential window even with low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding. (TETA and DEA refer to triethylenetetramine and diethanolamine, respectively).







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt;90&#8201;% within &#8722;0.1&#8211;&#8722;1.8&#8197;V and &gt;95&#8201;% within &#8722;0.2&#8211;&#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20&#8197;vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8722;0.02&#8197;VRHE) was detected by in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements, together with stable operation over 50&#8197;h with preserved FEformate of &#8776;95&#8201;% and high partial current density of 326.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE.

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence study of a model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst reveals that by suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% can be achieved even with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement.







Abstract
Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature 2020, 58, 411&#8211;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a combined experimental and computational study of the bismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes. With the protocol using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol and pinacolborane, we identified the role of protic and hydridic hydrogens through kinetic analysis and reactivity studies. The possibility of Bi&#8208;ligand cooperativity was assessed through isotope labeling experiments. This work validates the notion of Bi(I)/Bi(III) redox cycling.







Abstract
Organobismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low&#8208;valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1&#8201;a (2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)iminomethyl]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1&#8201;a and 4, an equilibrium between 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 (Ar=p&#8208;CF3&#8722;C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa&#8208;gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton&#8208;coupled nature of the transformation. The ensuing 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 is crystallographically characterized, and shown to be rapidly reduced to 1&#8201;a in the presence of 5. DFT calculations indicate a rate&#8208;limiting transition state in which the initial N&#8722;H bond is formed via concerted proton transfer upon nucleophilic addition of 1&#8201;a to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded adduct of azobenzene and 4. These studies guided the discovery of a second&#8208;generation Bi catalyst, the rate&#8208;limiting transition state of which is lower in energy, leading to catalytic transfer hydrogenation at lower catalyst loadings and at cryogenic temperature.

         <title>Kinetic Delay in Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization by Redefining the Trade&#8208;Off Relationship between H&#8208;Bonds and Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper molecular engineering can open new opportunities to create kinetically metastable states in monomers undergoing cooperative supramolecular polymerizations. This occurs by favoring dispersive interactions over H&#8208;bonds and thereby rebalancing the interplay between &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, Van der Waals, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states. In particular, we show that extending the aromatic content and favouring the interchain VdW interactions causes a delay into the cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a new family of toluene bis&#8208;amide derivatives by trapping the metastable inactive state.

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PanH, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was identified and verified as the enzyme responsible for epoxycyclohexenone formation in panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis. A PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst enabled an enzymatic approach to synthesize a library of bioactive epoxycyclohexenone compounds.







Abstract
An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i)&#8197;identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii)&#8197;biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal ions docked to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.







Abstract
Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8211;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.

&lt;p&gt;Alkali metal ions docked to water-soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte cations dependent kinetics on CoOOH catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is derived from cation intercalation, which can rationally tailor the formation energy of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process. This finding provides an informative picture to understand the complicated mechanism of electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8722;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Framework Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between hydrogen bonding and the coordination chemistry of halide anions offers a promising strategy to construct crystalline microporous frameworks with adaptive cavities and fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity for efficient Xe/Kr separation. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect.







Abstract
Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diverse guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here a study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, with the aim to develop hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons that enable the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behaviors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ca. 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF=7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas streams exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8722;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>

Reducing the coordination number is feasible to lower the rate&#8208;determination&#8208;step energy barrier, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. Our designed low&#8208;coordination IrOx delivers superior activity as well as excellent stability in water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8722;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8722;O coordination number's role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2 using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accompanied by long durability (100&#8197;h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEM water electrolyzer delivers a low voltage (1.72&#8197;V@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200&#8197;h (@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.

         <title>Construction of Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8722;C2 Single&#8208;Atoms Electrocatalyst Facilitating the Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5&#8208;triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR to CH4.







Abstract
Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY.

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5-triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing Cu single-atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta-position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low-coordination Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one-step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure, which exhibited high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low-coordination Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8901;-transferring mechanism for e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and offers a protocol for the preparation of two-coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

A general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy is proposed to synthesize metal atom&#8208;clusters with engineered coordination in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon. The optimum FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC shows remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, compared with the benchmark analogue of N&#8208;coordinated iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C). This work presents a paradigm for the regulation and optimization of atomically dispersed catalysts.







Abstract
Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8722;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C), FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC as cathodic catalyst exhibits all&#8208;round superiority to Pt/C and most Fe&#8208;based ADCs. This work provides an exemplary method for establishing atomic&#8208;cluster catalysts with engineered S&#8208;dominated coordination and hollowed carbon matrix, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication and optimization of advanced ADCs.

Our study makes a stride in the discovery of acid&#8208;stable Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) for PEM through single&#8208;atom tuning strategy. The XAFS elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces (HGBIs), engineering attractive activity of ultra&#8208;low overpotential and 500&#8197;h superior durability in acid.







Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective and sustainable acidic water oxidation catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth mechanism understanding for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a breakthrough of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, and water splitting stability of 500&#8197;hours in acid, making it one of the best&#8208;performing acid&#8208;stable OER non&#8208;noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8722;Co distance (ca. 2.80&#8197;&#197;) followed oxo&#8208;oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090&#8197;cm&#8722;1), confirmed by in situ SR&#8208;FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 high mass current density using the first reported noble metal&#8208;free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8722;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM&#8208;WE at 2.14&#8197;V was recorded.

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>

Systematic increase in the bulkiness of dye substituents revealed an unexpected thermodynamic stability of face&#8208;to&#8208;face (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions during supramolecular polymerization. Our results contribute to the development of functional supramolecular polymers by controlling dye&#8208;dye interactions through molecular design.







Abstract
The functionalization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoaffinity labeling has been a staple of chemical biology for the capture of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Through conjugation of a trifluorinated 7&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photo&#8208;crosslinking of glycan&#8208;protein interactions. This strategy and these &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; enable traceable photoaffinity labeling and could prove uniquely valuable for imaging biological recognition of glycans.







Abstract
Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.

         <title>Cascade Energy Transfer and White&#8208;Light Emission in Chirality&#8208;Controlled Crystallization&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Dimensional Co&#8208;assemblies from Donor and Acceptor Dye&#8208;Conjugated Polylactides</title>

         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission by sequential F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from thermally robust precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies is unravelled. It is driven by stereocomplex crystallization between two complementary chromophore&#8208;conjugated polylactide stereoisomers in the presence of an external dye.







Abstract
Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from biodegradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low&#8208;Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: An Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cage with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands, with positional and orientational control, has been built by using ancillary pairings. In this approach, the ligands with Pd(II)&#8208;binding sites come together in complementary ways due to their denticity (3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 2&#8201;:&#8201;2) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA&#8201;:&#8201;DD or AD&#8201;:&#8201;DA).







Abstract
One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply stranded lantern&#8208;shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1)&#8197;the formation of heteroleptic (multi&#8208;ligand) assemblies, or 2)&#8197;homoleptic assemblies from low&#8208;symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low&#8208;symmetry ligands, a hybid of these two approaches, would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a cis position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites. By using this approach, we have successfully used low&#8208;symmetry ligands to synthesise complex heteroleptic cages, including an example with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands.

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural feature of natural necrosome, kinase&#8208;biomimetic D&#8208;retro&#8208;inverso peptides (DRI&#8208;peptides) are designed and able to strongly associate with kinases. This feature of the peptides facilitates formation of artificial peptide&#8208;protein necrosomes and thus selectively activating the necrotic signaling pathway to induce cellular necroptosis.







Abstract
The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.

         <dc:description>
Broad screening of the substrate specificity of SIRT7 revealed a strong preference for the cleavage of long&#8208;chain acyllysine modifications. The activity was substantially increased in the presence of oligonucleotides or nucleosome particles. Finally, random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) delivered a cyclopeptide with potency in the sub&#8208;micromolar range and selectivity for SIRT7, which binds and stabilizes SIRT7 in cells.







Abstract
The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms, in part due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with a low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as de novo cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause an increase in the acetylation of H3&#8201;K18.

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method has been developed for installing stable polyradicals into polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, as illustrated by the formation of an air&#8208;stable, high&#8208;spin carbon&#8208;based diradical with a new ferromagnetic coupling motif of diazapyrene. The structure of the diradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, while the magnetic measurements provided unambiguous evidence for the high&#8208;spin ground state and a long spin relaxation process.







Abstract
Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif synthesized by a convenient method that allows the integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles has been developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing a triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2&#8776;31&#8197;h) in air. Compared to the widely used 1,3&#8208;phenylene, the newly designed (diaza)pyrene&#8208;4,10&#8208;diyl moiety is for the first time demonstrated to confer ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling, allowing delocalized non&#8208;disjoint SOMOs. With the X&#8208;ray crystallography unambiguously proving the diradical structure, the triplet ground state was thoroughly characterized. A large &#916;ES&#8208;T of 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol, proving the strong FM coupling effect, was revealed consistently by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while the zero&#8208;field splitting and triplet nutation characters were examined by continuous&#8208;wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy. A millisecond spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time was also detected. The current study not only offers a new molecular motif enabling FM coupling between carbon&#8208;based spins, but more importantly presents a general method for installing stable polyradicals into functional &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular customization strategy was applied for efficient MOF membrane fabrication. MOF material screening, defect&#8208;free membrane output, membrane physicochemical property regulation and separation applications can be rapidly realized by separately designing and modifying the MOF module within the membrane. High separation performance is easily achieved, which can meet diverse separation requirements.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H2 permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction of pyridines generates highly substituted piperidines, featuring diverse functional handles, with excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity. The origin of the unprecedented selectivities and additional insights into the reaction mechanism are discussed based on combined experimental mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new understanding on the activation of 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of carbon materials, through H&#8208;passivated and distorted lattices, and demonstrated how carbon cloth can be offered via this strategy with excellent and stable 2e&#8722; ORR for the H2O2 production.







Abstract
The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8722; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8722; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8722; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic covalent helical polymers in solid form are in high demand. By biomimicry, we designed a dipeptide monomer containing azide and alkyne that organize in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail as supramolecular helices in their crystals. Upon heating, the monomer undergoes SCSC TAAC polymerization to yield a covalent helical polymer. Single crystals of this fully organic polymer show high flexural strength, compressive strength and load&#8208;bearing capacity.







Abstract
There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating dipeptide Gly&#8208;Pro units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60&#8201;&#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5&#8197;million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98&#8197;kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.

A design strategy toward near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes based on utilization of an antiaromatic azepine is reported by Masahito Murai, Takahiro Enoki, and Shigehiro Yamaguchi in their Research Article (e202311445). While benzo&#8208;fused azepines take bent conformations, which undergo large structural relaxation to planar conformations in the excited state, thieno&#8208;fused congeners with electron&#8208;accepting groups at both termini adopt flat conformations even in the ground state, giving rise to NIR&#8208;emissions that exceed 850 nm.

Electrochemical 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation is a sustainable tool for introducing important vicinal diol&#8208;related structures in alkenes. The scuba divers in the cover picture perform the highly efficient diacetoxylation of alkenes using renewable electricity as the driving force, as reported by Dirk De&#8197;Vos and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311539). Excellent yields are obtained with a wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes in an atom&#8208;efficient and versatile protocol, with also application to lactone synthesis.

The rational design of metal oxide catalysts is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202310062), Bingsen Zhang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko, Zhong&#8208;Wen Liu et&#8197;al. report that structural properties of supported/bulk metal oxides can be controlled through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8901;H2O solution because of dissolution and simultaneous precipitation of individual catalyst components. The method enables to tailor catalyst reducibility that plays a pivotal role for C&#8722;H bond activation in hydrocarbons.

This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions and their applications for different therapeutic targets. In addition, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for expanding their practical application.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising toolbox for dissecting biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions have attracted considerable attention in the medical field for treating diseases, since this approach may lead to improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. For precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite that the reactions should occur in the right locations and on the appropriate therapeutic targets. In this minireview, we highlight the design and development of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise medical treatment. First, we compile recent strategies for achieving target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for the precise treatment of different therapeutic targets. Finally, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for safe, efficient, and translatable disease treatment.

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advantages of using C&#8722;F bonds as functional handles for chemical synthesis. Specific examples are used to illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can streamline small molecule synthesis and enable new reactions. The goal of this review is to educate chemists on the opportunities available for incorporating C&#8722;F bonds in synthetic route planning and for exploiting the unique mechanistic pathways available to C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8722;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8722;F bonds. As such, C&#8722;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advances of defluorinative functionalization are discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8722;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8722;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>

COFs are emerging and promising candidates in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Significant progress has developed in the past several years. However, comprehensive reviews on this specific field are lacking. This minireview presents an overview of the development of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production, highlighting the recent strategies to optimize COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The insights into the future development of industrial&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective H2O2 production are also offered.







Abstract
Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis in 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemicals not limited to H2O2.

Over the past few years, numerous COFs-based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value-added chemicals not limited to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Metals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) facilitates exceptional gas&#8208;phase catalytic activity, stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible catalysts, and fundamental insight into pertinent reaction mechanisms. MOFs present an ideal porous, crystalline, and chemically mutable matrix for such species. Herein we examine synthesis techniques and applications for the matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.

The multifunctionality of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based textiles encourages innovation of a wearable platform technology capable of sensing, filtration, detoxification, and catalysis. This Review focuses on the implementation of MOFs at the fiber level to form functional components in smart textiles.







Abstract
Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Enones via Chloroacylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (enones) and esters. Regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides and chloroformates takes place under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.







Abstract
Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promotes the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Uniform Colloidal Polymer Rods by Stabilizer&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform colloidal polymer rods/disks with tunable aspect ratios and well&#8208;defined internal molecular packing and orientations were successfully achieved from homopolymers or random copolymers by stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. They show an unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying memory effect, which have been used for high&#8208;level encryption and secure delivery of paper documents.







Abstract
The synthesis of anisotropic colloidal building blocks is essential for their self&#8208;assembly into hierarchical materials. Here, a highly efficient stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (SA&#8208;LCDSA) strategy was developed to achieve monodisperse colloidal polymer rods. This strategy does not require the use of block copolymers, but only homopolymers or random copolymers. The resulting rods have tunable size and aspect ratios, as well as well&#8208;defined columnar liquid crystal structures. The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA&#8208;LCDSA&#8208;based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;&#8208;molecular units.

The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo-induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA-LCDSA-based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;-molecular units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual steric and electronic effects of through&#8208;space charge transfer excited states have been exploited to concurrently shorten the delayed fluorescence lifetime and mitigate the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of multiple resonance B&#8722;N emitter. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new emitter show high efficiencies, small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability.







Abstract
B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8722;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8722;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91&#8201;% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7&#8201;% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8722;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2&#8197;h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Toughening Brittle Bio&#8208;P3HB with Synthetic P3HB of Engineered Stereomicrostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding mechanical brittleness issue associated with stereoperfect biological or synthetic P3HB is solved through blending it with synthetic P3HB with specifically engineered stereomicrostructures, which not only drastically enhances the toughness by &gt;156&#215; and optical clarity but also largely maintains its otherwise desirably high elastic modulus, tensile strength, melting temperature.







Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100&#8201;%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788&#8197;kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to &#8776;30&#8197;MPa, fracture strain to &#8776;800&#8201;%, and toughness to 126&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 (&gt;110&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% dramatically enhances its ductility from &#8776;5&#8201;% to 95&#8211;450&#8201;% and optical clarity from 19&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% visible light transmittance while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1&#8197;GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35&#8197;MPa), and melting temperature (160&#8211;170&#8201;&#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.

         <title>Propeller vs Quasi&#8208;Planar 6&#8208;Cantilever Small Molecular Platforms with Extremely Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension on different elementary units (triptycene vs. triphenylene), demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising molecular innovation platforms for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension. When applied in small molecular acceptors, the only two cases of CH25 and CH26 that could contain six terminals and such broad conjugated backbones have been afforded thus far, rendering featured absorptions, small reorganization and exciton binding energies. Moreover, their distinctive but completely different molecular geometries result in sharply contrasting nanoscale film morphologies. Finally, CH26 contributes to the best device efficiency of 15.41&#8201;% among acceptors with six terminals, demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising 6&#8208;cantilever molecular innovation platforms.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Transfer Protocol for the Hydroxyalkenylation of Alkenes Using 1,2&#8208;Bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation by 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene was developed using persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron oxidizing reagent. Regioselective hydroxyalkenylation was observed for a variety of substituted alkenes. A photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation using an acridinium salt was also successful.







Abstract
We report a protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation. Using a persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation reagent and 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene as a radical acceptor in the presence of water, alkenes were converted into the corresponding 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyalkenes in good to high yields. The hydroxyalkenylation process involves the nucleophilic hydroxylation of alkene radical cations to give &#946;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals, which, after a radical addition/&#946;&#8208;elimination sequence, provide the products. We also report a photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation.

         <title>Modulating Ligand&#8208;Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo&#8208;polymers.

The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, &#8776;2&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford the corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned by the recipe of the star polymer mixtures used. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction procedure. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted through the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand-exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo-polymers. The reversible sorting process can be conducted through a typical solvent extraction procedure.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene acts as a substrate and a mediator in an electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction with alkyl bromides. The reaction conditions avoid competing alkyl radical homocoupling and allows for the accommodation of alkyl bromides with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups that are difficult to incorporate using alternative C(sp3) precursors.







Abstract
Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyanoacetates Enabled by Chiral Amide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates was achieved by Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates under the assistance of two types of chiral ligands, (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamides and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amides. The reaction afforded the coupling products bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamide and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amide are effective ligands for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl iodides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates. This arylation reaction gave &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;&#8208;alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.

         <title>Clustering Six Electrons within &#8220;Dawson&#8208;Like&#8221; Polyoxometalate: An Open Route toward Its Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The super&#8208;reduction of Dawson&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM) [H2AsW18O60]7&#8722; in water involves a disproportionation process generating POM with a metal&#8208;metal bonded triad as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. Then, the resulting six&#8208;electron reduced POM was used as a precursor to construct the largest POM containing W4+ reported to date.







Abstract
Super&#8208;reduction of polyoxometalates (POMs) in solution is of fundamental interest for designing innovative energy storage systems. In this article, we show that the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM can undergo a disproportionation process during its massive electron uptake, leading to species containing three metal&#8208;metal bonds as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 183W NMR), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), UV/Vis, and voltammetry techniques. This result indicates that electron storing within metal&#8208;metal bonds is not a unique property of Keggin&#8208;type POM as postulated since the 70s. Besides, we demonstrate that the presence of an electron&#8208;rich triad in the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM allows its post&#8208;functionalization with additional tungstate ions, generating a chiral molecule that is also the largest WIV&#8208;containing POMs known to date.

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving high photoresponse and low dark or noise current with a fast response speed under a low bias in polymer photodetectors, this study demonstrates the potential of incorporating the polymer with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state in the active layer to enhance the performance of organic photodetectors.







Abstract
Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5&#8197;V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector has the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3&#8201;% and the specific detectivity of 1.4&#215;1014&#8197;Jones at 710&#8197;nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22&#8197;times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Enantioselective Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective radical&#8208;radical coupling using combined photoredox/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis was developed. The coupling of a ketyl radical and an sp3&#8208;carbon radical allows access to &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.







Abstract
An enantioselective carbene&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;radical coupling of acyl imidazoles and racemic Hantzsch esters is disclosed. This method involves the coupling of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived ketyl radical and a secondary sp3&#8208;carbon radical and allows access to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl aliphatic ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities without any competitive epimerization. The utility of this protocol is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various pharmaceutical compounds and is further demonstrated by the transformation of the enantioenriched products to biologically relevant molecules. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled enantioselective desymmetrization of a novel dibromocyclobutene facilitates access to a versatile cyclobutene intermediate that can be functionalized to access a wide range of chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes and cyclobutanes.







Abstract
Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into various saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2&#8208;dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni&#8208;catalyzed photoredox C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono&#8208;coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high nuclearity Fe13 cluster with metal&#8208;metal interactions was prepared from a WFe3S3 precursor. This compound displays a large room temperature spin value and undergoes core structural rearrangement upon multielectron group transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8722;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S=13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed&#8208;valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN&#8208;doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8722; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors.

     alt="Mixed-Valence BN-Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed-valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN-doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed-valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open-shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN-doped corannulene radical cations [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, and three corannulene motifs [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;-stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self-assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of a forbidden transition (&#916;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=&#177;2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;-trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable-temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN-doped &#960;-trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coding Intrinsic Disorder into DNA Hybridization Probes Enables Discrimination of Single Nucleotide Variants over Wide and Tunable Temperature Ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Classic hybridization probes for discriminating single nucleotide mutations typically work at elevated temperatures and in very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T) due to the high entropy penalty. By adding intrinsic disorder into hybridization probes, we successfully expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#916;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#916;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, both &#916;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36&#8197;pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100&#8201;% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was synthesized via the one&#8208;pot Debus&#8208;Radziszewski multicomponent reaction. The material showed excellent two electron oxygen&#8208;reduction activity and when it was used as cathode catalyst and assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4&#8201;%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.

         <title>Geometrically Compelled Silicon(II)/Silicon(IV) Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Enables the Enamination of Nitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles bearing a side arm of the silylenyl group are prepared, all featuring the unique silicon(II)&#8594;silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction that facilitates the enamination of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles to afford the edge&#8208;fused Si&#8208;heterotricycles.







Abstract
Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4. These compounds exhibit a side arm of the amidinatosilylenyl group, featuring unidirectional silicon(II)/silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction on account of the geometric constraint. Furthermore, the reactions involving 2&#8211;4 with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge&#8208;fused of the Si&#8208;heteroimidazolidine&#8208;CN2Si2, silole&#8208;C4Si, and phenyl&#8208;C6&#8208;rings (5&#8211;13). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H&#8208;shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.

Furthermore, the reactions involving &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge-fused of the Si-heteroimidazolidine-CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, silole-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si, and phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-rings (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-H-bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H-shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen: Pushing the Limit of Multicentre Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8722;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358 mAh g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1mol% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3 &#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1 0 4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC-NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C-rate performance. Here, a strategy of three-section-sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain-growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase-formation, grain-growth and phase-preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1mol% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo-doped SC-NCM(MSC-NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3 &#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo-doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+-migration preferred (1 0 4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC-NCM cubes, because of which, C-rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC-NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large-scale production of SC-NCM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
