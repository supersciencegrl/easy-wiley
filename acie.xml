         <title>Enabling Polymer Single Crystals to Be High&#8208;Performance Dielectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semicrystalline polymer dielectrics (SPDs) are highly sought&#8208;after state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dielectric materials. As the disorder in SPDs degrades their electrical properties, homogeneously ordered SPDs are desired. However, complex crystallization behaviors of polymers make such homogeneity elusive. Polymer lamellar single crystals (PLSCs), the most regularly&#8208;ordered form of SPDs possible under mild crystallizing conditions, are ideal platforms for understanding and developing high&#8208;performance dielectric materials. Here, a typical and widely used SPD, polyethylene (PE) is selected as the model material. We successfully obtained, large, uniform, and high&#8208;quality PE PLSCs and devised a non&#8208;destructive strategy to construct PE PLSC&#8208;based vertical capacitors. These nanometer&#8208;thick capacitors exhibit exceptional dielectric properties, with a high breakdown strength of 6.95 MV/cm and a low dielectric constant of 2.14 &#177; 0.07, that outperform the properties of any existing neat PE. This work provides novel insights into exploring the performance possibility of ordered SPDs and reveals the PLSCs as potential high&#8208;performance dielectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylated Hexagonal Boron Nitride/Graphene Configuration for Electrosynthesis of High&#8208;Concentration Neutral Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron (2e&#8208;) oxygen (O2) reduction reaction (ORR) has great potential to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, but the design of low&#8208;cost and highly active and selective catalysts is greatly challenging for the long&#8208;term H2O2 production under industrial relevant current density, especially under neutral electrolytes. To address this issue, this work constructed a carboxylated hexagonal boron nitride/graphene (h&#8208;BN/G) heterojunction on the commercial activated carbon through the coupling of B, N co&#8208;doping with surface oxygen groups functionalization. The champion catalyst exhibited a high 2e&#8208; ORR selectivity (&gt;95%), production rate (up to 13.4 mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), and Faradaic efficiency (FE, &gt;95%). The long&#8208;term H2O2 production under the high current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 caused the cumulative concentration as high as 2.1 wt.%. The combination of in&#8208;situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculation indicated that the carboxylated h&#8208;BN/G configuration promotes the adsorption of O2 and the stabilization of the key intermediates (OOH* and HOOH*), allowing a low energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of HOOH* release from the active site, and thus improving the 2e&#8208; ORR performance. The fast dye degradation by using this electrochemical synthesized H2O2 further illustrated the promising practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Human ALKBH3 Mediated RNA N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent post&#8208;transcriptional RNA modification, and the distribution and dynamics of the modification play key epitranscriptomic roles in cell development. At present, the human AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family member ALKBH3 is the only known mRNA m1A demethylase, but its catalytic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present the structures of ALKBH3&#8208;oligo crosslinked complexes obtained with the assistance of a synthetic antibody crystallization chaperone. Structural and biochemical results showed that ALKBH3 utilized two &#946;&#8208;hairpins (&#946;4&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;5 and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;&#8242;&#8242;) and the &#945;2 helix to facilitate single&#8208;stranded substrate binding. Moreover, a bubble&#8208;like region around Asp194 and a key residue inside the active pocket (Thr133) enabled specific recognition and demethylation of m1A&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C)&#8208;modified substrates. Mutation of Thr133 to the corresponding residue in the AlkB Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family&#160; members FTO or ALKBH5 converted ALKBH3 substrate selectivity from m1A to N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A), as did Asp194 deletion. Our findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms of substrate recognition and m1A demethylation by ALKBH3. This study is expected to aid structure&#8208;guided design of chemical probes for further functional studies and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

Here, we present the structures of ALKBH3-oligo crosslinked complexes obtained with the assistance of a synthetic antibody crystallization chaperone.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation by a Versatile Chiral&#8208;Amide&#8208;Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile chiral amide directing group has been studied in the context of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Six transformations have been achieved, affording a series of valuable chiral products. With this tool, concise syntheses of many natural products and biologically active compounds (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol) were accomplished.







Abstract
A versatile and readily available chiral amide directing group has been developed for the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of the related chiral benzamides with various olefins, aldehydes and propargylic alcohols has been accomplished with high stereoselectivities, affording a series of chiral products including 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee), isocoumarins (up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee), phthalides (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee), chiral bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr), 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and allenes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Importantly, our methodologies enabled concise syntheses of many biologically active compounds and natural products (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol).

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Macroscale Sheets Powered by Enzyme Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded nano&#8208;sized enzymes, in the presence of their respective substrates, can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories on the air/water interface.







Abstract
Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano&#8208; and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self&#8208;propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet's motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates their potential utility for in vivo applications.

         <title>A Breast Cancer Stem Active Cobalt(III)&#8208;Cyclam Complex Containing Flufenamic Acid with Immunogenic Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first investigation into the cytotoxic and immunogenic potential of a cobalt complex within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt complex is able to deliver flufenamic acid to CSCs, which perturbs the inhibitory damage&#8208;associated molecular pattern axis and promotes immunogenic cell death. This subsequently leads to the phagocytosis of CSCs by macrophages.







Abstract
The cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating properties of a cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex bearing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid is reported within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 displays sub&#8208;micromolar potency towards breast CSCs grown in monolayers, 24&#8208;fold and 31&#8208;fold greater than salinomycin (an established anti&#8208;breast CSC agent) and cisplatin (an anticancer metallopharmaceutical), respectively. Strikingly, the cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 is 69&#8208;fold and 50&#8208;fold more potent than salinomycin and cisplatin towards three&#8208;dimensionally cultured breast CSC mammospheres. Mechanistic studies reveal that 1 induces DNA damage, inhibits cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 expression, and prompts caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Breast CSCs treated with 1 exhibit damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns characteristic of immunogenic cell death and are phagocytosed by macrophages. As far as we are aware, 1 is the first cobalt complex of any oxidation state or geometry to display both cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating effects on breast CSCs.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient carbonation of polyols under a CO2 atmosphere enables their C&#8722;H monoalkylation by photoredox catalysis. This reactivity results from an unprecedented C&#8722;H activation through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8722;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.

         <title>Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enables facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicks catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2 via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme.







Abstract
A nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme and ultrahigh H2O2 affinity as that of bioenzymes. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times compared to Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. This dramatically switched the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating (i.e. Fe1&#8208;SAzymes, preferably mimicking peroxidase) to scavenging ROS (i.e. Fe2&#8208;SAzymes, dominantly mimicking catalase). Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Ensembling Design of Hierarchically Ordered FAU&#8208;type Zeolite Frameworks for Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design comprising methodical incision of conventional FAU&#8208;type zeolites into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments and their subsequent reorganization into hierarchically ordered zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal/3D&#8208;cubic mesopore channels. This approach eludes the kinetic constraints of conventional crystallization to produce hierarchical zeolites having excellent catalytic properties in hydrocracking applications.







Abstract
Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world's fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst's longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized hierarchically porous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for synthesizing hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia
d) mesopore channels. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity's significance in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has often been overlooked in luminescent sensing applications. A luminescent MOF NKU&#8208;999 was synthesized with tailored pores for highly selective and quantitative p&#8208;xylene recognition. The sensing mechanism was investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities.







Abstract
The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.

Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU-999-EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU-999-EuTb exhibits high-performance in selective recognition for &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;Based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implemented an asymmetric coordination Fe&#8722;S1N3 SAC with significant geometric distortion. The Fe&#8722;S1N3 sites demonstrate distinctive self&#8208;relaxation behavior in response to different adsorption intermediates during the CO2RR process. The dynamic change in bond length enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediates adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity.







Abstract
Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8722;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02&#8201;%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34&#8197;h&#8722;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries with On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In batteries, the formation of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene accompanies degradation. Ultrasensitive on chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry reveals previously undetectable gas evolution in lithium ion batteries. The ensuing insight will enable battery scientists to predict degradation mechanisms and discover new strategies to stabilise device performance.







Abstract
The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Capacity fade is due to the complex interplay between phase transitions, electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution; many of these poorly understood parasitic reactions evolve gases as a side product. Here we present an on&#8208;chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry method that enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, fully quantified and time resolved detection of volatile species evolving from an operating LIB. The technique's electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the technique, including (a) observation of oxygen evolving from a LiNiMnCoO2 cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss (c) the first direct evidence, by virtue of the improved time resolution of our technique, that carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene takes place in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Interplay Within Microporous Manganese Dioxide Tunnels For Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework of manganese dioxides endows this family of materials with rich physiochemical properties and wide applications in sustainable energy storage. This review timely covers recent advancements related to such materials, with a focus on the atomistic insights into their structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships that are critical to further advance these applications.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured manganese dioxides (MnO2), also known as octahedral molecule sieves (OMS), are widely studied in geochemistry, deionization, energy storage and (electro)catalysis. These functionalities originate from their characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework, which, with a high degree of structural polymorphism and rich surface chemistry, can reversibly absorb and transport various ions. An intensive understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationship is prerequisite for functionality optimization, which has been recently approached by implementation of advanced (in situ) characterizations providing significant atomistic sciences. This review will thus timely cover recent advancements related to OMS and their energy storage applications, with a focus on the atomistic insights pioneered by researchers including our group: the origins of structural polymorphism and heterogeneity, the evolution of faceted OMS crystals and its effect on electrocatalysis, the ion transport/storage properties and their implication for processing OMS. These studies represent a clear rational behind recent endeavors investigating the historically applied OMS materials, the summary of which is expected to deepen the scientific understandings and guide material engineering for functionality control.

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological cables as electrodes: Electrically conducting filamentous cable bacteria skeletons were used as free&#8208;standing biological electrodes and displayed catalytic selectivity towards oxygen. The skeletons convert water to oxygen and oxygen back to water. We show that the reactions can be driven either by an external electric field or by simply exposing the cables to a gradient of oxygen concentration.







Abstract
Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transfer electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.

         <title>Acyl and CO Ligands in the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Scramble upon Photolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase cofactor contains an acyl&#8208; and two CO&#8208;ligands. Biosynthesis using stable isotopes demonstrated the formation of the acyl ligand from the carboxy group of the precursor, and MS/MS analysis indicated that the acyl and CO ligands exchanged during photolysis. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate during photolysis, which could explain the acyl/CO ligand exchange.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase harbors the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, in which the Fe(II) complex contains acyl&#8208;carbon, pyridinol&#8208;nitrogen, cysteine&#8208;thiolate and two CO as ligands. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light decomposes the FeGP cofactor to a 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (GP) and other components. Previous in vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated that the acyl&#8208; and CO&#8208;ligands in the FeGP cofactor can scramble, but whether scrambling occurred during biosynthesis or photolysis was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the [18O1&#8208;carboxy]&#8208;group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the 18O&#8208;labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [18O1]&#8208;acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light&#8208;excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H2&#8208;activating natural complex.

Here, we demonstrate that the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-carboxy]-group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]-acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl-Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light-excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-activating natural complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electrons can be stored in the arene anchor of robust tripodal siloxide frameworks by chemical reduction of their Th(IV) complexes. The two electrons become available at the metal center for the controlled two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while the ligand framework is retained in its original form.







Abstract
The high stability of the + IVoxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity. Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two&#8208;electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced [KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th((OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow implementation of two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.

         <title>Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Online monitoring of formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry reveals the growth of the size and complexity of sugar molecules. Chemometrics analysis identified the key reaction mixture components and their contribution to the dynamic reaction changes. The results allowed the reconstruction of the reaction networks and analysis of the kinetics of early steps of formose reaction.







Abstract
Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised &#8776;300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6&#8197;sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5&#8197;sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Live Imaging of Osteoclast Activation via Cathepsin K Activity in Bone Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe, CatKP1, has been developed to detect cathepsin K and enable the real&#8208;time monitoring of osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones during pathologic bone loss. This highlights the importance of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for studying aberrant osteoclast behavior and exploring new therapeutic strategies.







Abstract
Intravital fluorescence imaging of functional osteoclasts within their intact disease context provides valuable insights into the intricate biology at the microscopic level, facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches for osteoclast&#8208;associated bone diseases. However, there is a lack of studies investigating osteoclast activity within deep&#8208;seated bone lesions using appropriate fluorescent probes, despite the advantages offered by the multi&#8208;photon excitation system in enhancing deep tissue imaging resolution. In this study, we report on the intravital tracking of osteoclast activity in three distinct murine bone disease models. We utilized a cathepsin K (CatK)&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (CatKP1), which exhibited a notable fluorescence turn&#8208;on response in the presence of active CatK. By utilizing CatKP1, we successfully monitored a significant increase in osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones and its attenuation through pharmacological intervention without sacrificing mice. Thus, our findings highlight the efficacy of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for unraveling pathological osteoclast behavior and exploring novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets based on Pd&#8208;TCPP as Photocatalysts for Highly Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, a 2D MOF nanosheet derived Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst, denoted as Pd&#8208;MOF, was fabricated and examined for visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This Pd&#8208;MOF can provide a remarkable photocatalytic activity (a H2 production rate of 21.3 mmol/gh in the visible range), which outperforms recently reported Pt&#8208;MOFs (with a H2 production rate of 6.6 mmol/gh) with similar noble metal loading. Notably, this high efficiency of Pd&#8208;MOF is not due to different chemical environment of the metal center, nor by changes in the spectral light absorption. The higher performance of the Pd&#8208;MOF in comparison to the analogue Pt&#8208;MOF is attributed to the longer lifetime of the photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and higher charge transfer efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We used in vitro selection to identify DNAzymes that acylate the exocyclic nucleobase amines of cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine in DNA oligonucleotides. The acyl donor was the 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl ester (TFPE) of a 5&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl oligonucleotide. Yields are as high as &gt;95% in 6 h. Several of the N&#8208;acylation DNAzymes are catalytically active with RNA rather than DNA oligonucleotide substrates, and eight of nine DNAzymes for modifying C are site&#8208;specific (&gt;95%) for one particular substrate nucleotide. These findings expand the catalytic ability of DNA to include site&#8208;specific N&#8208;acylation of oligonucleotide nucleobases. Future efforts will investigate the DNA and RNA substrate sequence generality of DNAzymes for oligonucleotide nucleobase N&#8208;acylation, toward a universal approach for site&#8208;specific oligonucleotide modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active Coinage&#8208;metal Sulfide Clusters for High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of facile&#8208;synthesis and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray scintillators with high light yield, low detection limit and high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution plays a vital role in medical and industrial imaging fields. However, the optimal balance between X&#8208;ray absorption, decay lifetime and excitonic utilization efficiency of scintillators to achieve high&#8208;resolution imaging is extremely difficult due to the inherent contradiction. Here two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;actived coinage&#8208;metal clusters M6S6L6 (M = Ag or Cu) were synthesized by simple solvothermal reaction, where the cooperation of heavy atom&#8208;rich character and TADF mechanism supports strong X&#8208;ray absorption and rapid luminescent collection of excitons. Excitingly, Ag6S6L6 (SC&#8208;Ag) displays a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91.6% and scintillating light yield of 17420 photons MeV&#8211;1, as well as a low detection limit of 208.65 nGy s&#8211;1 that is 26 times lower than the medical standard (5.5 &#956;Gy s&#8211;1). More importantly, a high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 16 lp/mm based on SC&#8208;Ag screen is demonstrated. Besides, rigid core skeleton reinforced by metallophilicity endows clusters M6S6L6 strong resistance to humidity and radiation. This work provides a new view for the design of efficient scintillators and opens the research door for silver clusters in scintillation application.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of   L&#8208;RNA Aptamer&#8208;Peptide  Conjugate for Efficient Cell Uptake and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;Mediated Gene Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA  G&#8208;quadruplexes (D&#8208;rG4s) are prevalent in the transcriptome and play crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes. Recently, L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been reported to recognize functional rG4s with a strong binding affinity and specificity. However, owing to the poor cell penetration capacity of L&#8208;RNA aptamers, their biological applications are currently limited. Herein, we rationally design an L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;peptide conjugate, Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c, which can efficiently translocate into the cytosol and target the rG4 of interest. Notably, we demonstrate diverse regulatory roles of Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c on rG4 motif present in different regions of mRNAs and further expand the application in different cell lines. Our novel and biocompatible conjugate enhances the cellular uptake of the L&#8208;RNA aptamer, and our robust strategy enables non&#8208;canonical RNA structures to be targeted by L&#8208;RNA aptamers for gene control in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature synthesis of crystalline Sb3N5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemical reaction between Sb and N2 was induced under high&#8208;pressure (32&#8208;35 GPa) and high&#8208;temperature (1600&#8208;2200 K) conditions, generated by a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The reaction product was identified by single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at 35 GPa and room temperature as crystalline antimony nitride with Sb3N5 stoichiometry and structure belonging to orthorhombic space group Cmc21. Only Sb&#8208;N bonds are present in the covalent bonding framework, with two types of Sb atoms respectively forming SbN6 distorted octahedra and trigonal prisms and three types of N atoms forming NSb4 distorted tetrahedra and NSb3 trigonal pyramids. Taking into account two longer Sb&#8208;N distances, the SbN6 trigonal prisms can be depicted as SbN8 square antiprisms and the NSb3 trigonal pyramids as NSb4 distorted tetrahedra. The Sb3N5 structure can be described as an ordered stacking in the bc plane of bi&#8208;layers of SbN6 octahedra alternated to monolayers of SbN6 trigonal prisms (SbN8 square antiprisms). The discovery of Sb3N5 finally represents the long sought&#8208;after experimental evidence for Sb to form a crystalline nitride, providing new insights about fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and opening new perspectives for the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of pnictogen nitrides and the synthesis an entire class of new materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyurethane with &#946;&#8208;Selenocarbonyl Structure Enabling the Combination of Plastic Degradation and Waste Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable polymers offer a promising solution to mitigate global plastic pollution, but the degraded products often suffer from diminished value. Upcycling is a more sustainable approach to upgrade polymer waste into value&#8208;added products. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208;selenocarbonyl&#8208;containing polyurethane (SePU), which can be directly degraded under mild conditions into valuable selenium fertilizers for selenium&#8208;rich vegetable cultivation globally, enabling both plastic degradation and waste upcycling. Under oxidation condition, this polymer can be easily and selectively degraded via selenoxide elimination reaction from mixed plastic waste. The degraded product can serve as effective selenium fertilizers to increase selenium content in radish and pak choi. The SePU exhibits excellent mechanical properties. Additionally, we observed the formation of spherulites&#8208;like selenium particles within the materials during degradation for the first time. Our research offers a successful application of selenoxide elimination reaction in the field of plastic degradation for the first time, endowing plastics with both degradability and high reusable value. This strategy provides a promising solution to reduce pollution and improve economy and sustainability of plastics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic and redox neutral cascade reaction enabled by asymmetric bimetallic relay catalysis via merging ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric borrowing&#8208;hydrogen reaction with copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition has been realized. A variety of highly functionalized 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid esters or peptides bearing 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereogenic centers have been prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Judicious selection and rational modification of the Ru&#8208;catalysts with careful tuning reaction conditions played a pivotal role in stereoselectivity control as well as attenuating undesired &#945;&#8208;epimerization, thus enabling a full complement of all four stereoisomers that were otherwise inaccessible in previous work.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission in the near infrared are expected to have applications in bio&#8208;imaging and other areas. Although room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence display long&#8208;lived emission of approximately one minute, organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems with a similar emission mechanism to inorganic persistent emitters can emit for several hours at room temperature. In particular, OLPL with a hole&#8208;diffusion mechanism can function even in the presence of oxygen. However, ionic materials lack long&#8208;term stability in neutral organic host owing to aggregation and phase separation. In this study, we synthesised polymers with stable near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence at room temperature via the copolymerization of electron donors and acceptors. The copolymers exhibit long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) at temperatures below the glass transition temperature and can be excited by approximately the entire range of visible light. LPL properties and spectra can be controlled by the dopant.</dc:description>

However, most borane&#8208;based LPs are moisture and air&#8208;sensitive. Therefore, development of moisture and air&#8208;stable borane&#8208;based LP is highly desirable. To achieve this goal, the concept of &#8220;aggregation induced enlargement effects&#8221; by chemically linking multiple borane within a nanoscopic confinement was conceived to create macromolecular LA. Accordingly, an extremely moisture and air stable macromolecular borane, namely, PVP&#8208;1B featuring poly(4&#8208;vinylphenol) backbone, was constructed. The concentration of borane active site is greatly higher than average concentration due to local confinement. Therefore, an enhanced activity was observed. Moreover, the local LA aggregation effects allow its tolerance to air and large amount of chain transfer agent. Consequently, PVP&#8208;1B showed remarkable efficiency for propylene oxide (PO) polymerization at 25 &#8451; (TOF = 27900 h&#8208;1). Furthermore, it enables generation of well&#8208;defined telechelic poly (CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;CO2) diol (0.6&#8208;15.3 kg/mol) with narrow &#272;s via copolymerizing cyclohexene oxide and CO2 at 80 &#176;C. This work indicates unifying multiple borane within a polymer in a macromolecular level shows superior catalytic performance than constructing binary, bi(multi)functional systems in a molecular level. This paves a new way to make functional polyethers.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Indole Compounds Bearing both Axial and Central Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the chemistry community, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has proven to be a significant but challenging issue owing to the importance and difficulty in constructing such frameworks. In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan&#8208;indoles with 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan&#8208;indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction and Water Oxidation under Spatial Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into fuels and oxygen&#160;is a highly promising solution for carbon&#8208;neutral recycling. Traditionally, researchers have studied CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation separately, overlooking potential synergistic interplay between these processes. This study introduces an innovative approach, spatial synergy, which encourages synergistic progress by bringing the two half&#8208;reactions into atomic proximity. To facilitate this, we developed a defective ZnIn2S4&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst (Cu&#8208;SA/D&#8208;ZIS), which demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance with CO2 reduction rates of 112.5 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 and water oxidation rates of 52.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, exhibiting a six&#8208;fold enhancement over D&#8208;ZIS. The structural characterization results indicated that the trapping effect of vacancy associates on single&#8208;atom copper led to the formation of an unsaturated coordination structure, Cu&#8208;S3, consequently giving rise to the CuZn&#8242;VS&#8226;&#8226;VZn" defect complexes.&#160;FT&#8208;IR studies&#160;coupled with&#160;theoretical calculations&#160;reveal the spatially synergistic CO2 reduction and water oxidation on CuZn&#8242;VS&#8226;&#8226;VZn", where the breakage of O&#8208;H in water oxidation is synchronized with the formation of *COOH, significantly lowering the energy barrier. Notably, this study introduces and, for the first time, substantiates the spatial synergy effect in CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation through a combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, providing a fresh insight in optimizing photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Noncanonical &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids Containing &#947;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) containing tertiary alcohols are valuable as precursors of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the assembly of such ncAA scaffolds from simple material by C&#8211;C bond formation remains a challenging task due to the presence of multiple stereocenters and large steric hindrance. In this study, we present a novel solution to this problem through highly selective enzymatic decarboxylative aldol addition. This method allows for the streamlined assembly of multifunctionalized ncAAs with &#947;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available materials, such as L&#8208;aspartatic acid and isatins, vicinal diones and keto esters. The modularity of electrophiles furnished four classes of ncAAs with decent efficiency as well as excellent site and stereocontrol. Computational modeling was employed to gain detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism and to provide a rationale for the observed selectivities. The method offers a single&#8208;step approach to producing multifunctionalized ncAAs, which can be directly utilized in peptide synthesis and bioactivity assessment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) combines polymerization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers in one system and has become a widely used method to prepare block copolymer nanoparticles at high concentrations. The persistence of polymers in the environment poses a huge threat to the ecosystem and represents a significant waste of resources. There is an urgent need to develop novel chemical approaches to synthesize degradable polymers. To meet with this demand, it is crucial to install degradability into PISA nanoparticles. Most recently, degradable PISA nanoparticles have been synthesized by introducing degradation mechanisms into either shell&#8208;forming or core&#8208;forming blocks. This minireview summarizes the development in degradable block copolymer nanoparticles synthesized by PISA, including shell&#8208;degradable, core&#8208;degradable and all&#8208;degradable nanoparticles. Future development will benefit from expansion of polymerization techniques with new degradation mechanisms and adaptation of high&#8208;throughput approaches for both PISA syntheses and degradation studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8216;Chemputer&#8217; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV&#8208;Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system&#8217;s capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and highly selective Ir&#8208;catalysts have been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted acyclic enones. The mechanism and the effects of the catalyst and reaction parameters on selectivity have been unraveled by means of deuterogenation experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air&#8208;stable Ir&#8722;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition.

     alt="Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast and highly selective Ir-catalysts have been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted acyclic enones. The mechanism and the effects of the catalyst and reaction parameters on selectivity have been unraveled by means of deuterogenation experiments and DFT calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air-stable Ir&#8722;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Werner Salt as Nickel and Ammonia Source for Photochemical Synthesis of Primary Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Werner salt [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts, solving the problem of easy deactivation and difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts.







Abstract
Cheap, stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Werner ammine salts have been known for more than a century; but they have been rarely used in organic synthesis. Herein, we report that the Werner hexammine complex [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts. More than 80&#8197;aryl chlorides, including more than 20 drug molecules, were aminated, demonstrating the practicality and generality of this method in synthetic chemistry. A slow NH3 release mechanism is in operation, obviating the problem of catalyst poisoning. Still interestingly, we show that the Werner salt can be easily recovered and reused, solving the problem of difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts. The protocol thus provides an efficient new strategy for the synthesis of primary aryl amines.

         <title>Reference&#8208;Quality Free Energy Barriers in Catalysis from Machine Learning Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free energy barriers of acid&#8208;catalyzed cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes are computed at an unprecedented level of theory, combining dynamic effects investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics and high&#8208;level electronic energy calculations with Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory. The results are close to chemical accuracy.







Abstract
For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation&#8212;RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) show a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Optimize the Properties of Organic Fluorophores for Imaging and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review has clarified the reasons for the insufficient properties of fluorophores, including short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, and summarizes the methods for optimizing these properties developed in recent years. The review will provide a theoretical guidance and helpful insights for the design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields. However, many available dyes suffer from insufficient performances, such as short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, restricting their application in advanced imaging technology and complex imaging. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been made to improve these performances of fluorophores. Starting with the luminescence principle of fluorophores, this review clarifies the mechanisms of the insufficient performance for traditional fluorophores to a certain extent, systematically summarizes the modified approaches of optimizing properties, highlights the typical applications of the improved fluorophores in imaging and sensing, and indicates existing problems and challenges in this area. This progress not only proves the significance of improving fluorophores properties, but also provide a theoretical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.

         <title>Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer, from electrons of a gold nanocluster core to reductive Ru (II) active center in the hybrid layer, is presented to overcome the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species. The proposed nanoplatform&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy leads to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs currently dominate the field of chemotherapeutic agents; however, achieving the controlled activation of metal prodrugs remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a universal strategy for the radiation&#8208;triggered activation of metal prodrugs via nanosurface energy transfer (NSET). The core&#8211;shell nanoplatform (Ru&#8208;GNC) is composed of gold nanoclusters (GNC) and ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;containing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid coatings. Upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, chemotherapeutic Ru (II) complexes were released in a controlled manner through a unique NSET process involving the transfer of photoelectron energy from the radiation&#8208;excited Ru&#8208;GNCs to the Ru&#8208;containing hybrid layer. In contrast to the traditional radiation&#8208;triggered activation of prodrugs, such an NSET&#8208;based system ensures that the reactive species in the tumor microenvironment are present in sufficient quantity and are not easily quenched. Additionally, ultrasmall Ru&#8208;GNCs preferably target mitochondria and profoundly disrupt the respiratory chain upon irradiation, leading to radiosensitization by generating abundant reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ru&#8208;GNC&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy induces immunogenic cell death, resulting in significant therapeutic outcomes when combined with the programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) checkpoint blockade. This NSET strategy represents a breakthrough in designing radiation&#8208;triggered nanoplatforms for metal&#8208;prodrug&#8208;mediated cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.

         <title>Azonia&#8208;Naphthalene: A Cationic Hydrophilic Building Block for Stable N&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), for n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of AN, the AN&#8208;based polymers show typical n&#8208;type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic&#8208;electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The integration of cationic building blocks will undoubtedly enrich the material library for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

&lt;p&gt;We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a-azonia-naphthalene (AN), for n-type organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron-withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation-&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next-generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a-azonia-naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of AN, the AN-based polymers show typical n-type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation-&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic-electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The integration of cationic building blocks will undoubtedly enrich the material library for high-performance n-type conjugated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Isolated Atomically Dispersed Nanocatalysts for Self&#8208;Motivated Cocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;isolated mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) with ligand&#8208;field&#8208;effect&#8208;promoted cocatalytic Fenton catalysis have been constructed. The catechols from dopamine serve as both an iron coordination site for atomic isolation and a reductive ligand to generate a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs, thereby promoting in vivo Fenton catalytic effects against tumors.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic tumor therapy based on Fenton nanocatalysts has attracted considerable attention because of its therapeutic specificity, enhanced outcomes, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the rate&#8208;determining step in Fenton chemistry, which involves the transition of a high&#8208;valence metallic center (FeIII) to a Fenton&#8208;active low&#8208;valence metallic center (FeII), has hindered advances in nanocatalyst&#8208;based therapeutics. In this study, we constructed mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) by employing catechols from dopamine to coordinate and isolate single iron atoms. The catechols also serve as reductive ligands, generating a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs. This self&#8208;motivated cocatalytic strategy enabled by mSAFe NCs accelerates the kinetics of the Fenton catalytic reaction, resulting in remarkable performance for nanocatalytic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Bond Annulation with Bromoalkynes under Cobalt Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization of phosphinamides with haloalkynes with excellent enantioinduction and inverse regioselectivity. In a single step, the approach provides access to several P&#8208;chiral molecules. Based on control experiments and preliminary study, a plausible mechanism is provided.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond annulation strategy offers a versatile platform, allowing the construction of complex P&#8208;chiral molecules through atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical fashion. However, regioselective insertion of &#960;&#8208;coupling partner between M&#8722;C bond with high enantio&#8208;induction remain elusive. Using commercially available Co(II) salt and chiral&#8208;Salox ligands, we demonstrate an unusual protocol for the regio&#8208;reversal, enantioselective C&#8722;H bond annulation of phosphinamide with bromoalkyne through desymmetrization. The reaction proceeds through ligand&#8208;assisted enantiodetermining cyclocobaltation followed by regioselective insertion of bromoalkyne between Co&#8722;C, subsequent reductive elimination, and halogen exchange with carboxylate resulted in P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent ee (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). The isolation of cobaltacycle involved in the catalytic cycle and the outcome of control experiments provide support for a plausible mechanism.

         <title>Modulation of Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap in Atomically Precise Silver Cluster&#8208;Assembled Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was modulated by controlling the inter&#8208;cluster interaction defined by the supramolecular arrangements of Ag12 nanoclusters.







Abstract
Silver cluster&#8208;based solids have garnered considerable attention owing to their tunable luminescence behavior. While surface modification has enabled the construction of stable silver clusters, controlling interactions among clusters at the molecular level has been challenging due to their tendency to aggregate. Judicious choice of stabilizing ligands becomes pivotal in crafting a desired assembly. However, detailed photophysical behavior as a function of their cluster packing remained unexplored. Here, we modulate the packing pattern of Ag12 clusters by varying the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. CAM&#8208;1 formed through coordination of the tritopic linker molecule and NC&#8208;1 with monodentate pyridine ligand; established via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Both the assemblies show ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT) based cluster&#8208;centered emission band(s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra exhibit blue shifts at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the extent of the thermal reverse population of the S1 state from the closely spaced T1 state. The difference in the energy gap (&#916;EST) dictated by their assemblies played a pivotal role in the way that Ag12 cluster assembly in CAM&#8208;1 manifests a wider &#916;EST and thus requires higher temperatures for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) than assembly of NC&#8208;1. Such assembly&#8208;defined photoluminescence properties underscore the potential toolkit to design new cluster&#8208; assemblies with tailored optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers.

     alt="Full-Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co-assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge-transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co-assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full-spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar-to-hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z-Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new look at catalytic Wittig&#8208;type olefinations. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials leading to the development of a highly E&#8208;selective copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners.







Abstract
Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams was developed through a sequential process consisting of iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group followed by iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid. The method was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.







Abstract
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid was developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals containing a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetals undergo a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition reactions via iminium ions to give substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two giant metallo&#8208;macrocycles with double&#8208;layer and triple&#8208;layer concentric heptagonal structures (DA and TA, respectively) have been successfully assembled by embedding coordination sites in the ligand backbone. The angle between the two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) units increased after complexation with metal ions, leading to precise control over the topology.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene rings as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) extended after complexation with metal ions, leading to ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied, with both supramolecules exhibiting good conversion rates. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.

Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed as a host to confine charged iodine species. The robust physicochemical adsorption between cCNF and polyiodides effectively mitigated the shuttle effect and increased iodine loading, resulting in enhanced cycling stability and high energy density even at elevated temperatures, thereby demonstrating promising performance at the full&#8208;battery level.







Abstract
High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, high areal capacity of 2.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, facilitating the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Intermediates adsorbed on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species in the CH4 production from CO2 form are more thermodynamically favorable. The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH4 selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH4 production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), over ten times of that for CN.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.

         <title>Diluting the Resistance of Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x for Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Alkaline Seawater Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
The oxygen vacancy dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field of Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to accelerate the hydrogen transfer step in hydrogen spillover, improving hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
Recently, hydrogen spillover based binary (HSBB) catalysts have received widespread attention due to the sufficiently utilized reaction sites. However, the specific regulation mechanism of spillover intensity is still unclear. Herein, we have fabricated oxygen vacancies enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to investigate the internal relationship between electron supply and mechanism of hydrogen spillover enhancement. The DFT calculations cooperate with in situ Raman spectrum to uncover that the H* spillover from NiMoO4&#8208;x to Ru. Meanwhile, oxygen vacancies weakened the electron supply from Ru to NiMoO4&#8208;x, which contributes to dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) for hydrogen spillover. In addition, the higher ion concentration in electrolyte will promote the H* adsorption step obviously, which is demonstrated by in situ EIS tests. As a result, the Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x exhibits a low overpotential of 206&#8197;mV at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 28.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and an excellent durability of 550&#8197;h at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#8197;M KOH seawater.

         <title>Consumer Grade Polyethylene Recycling via Hydrogenolysis on Ultrafine Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium particles of &#8764;1&#8197;nm supported on titania achieved via hydrogenolysis up to 80&#8201;% conversion of HDPE used in bottle caps into light alkanes at mild conditions and showed reusability. General selectivity trends were disclosed across HDPE types. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as reaction progresses, nuanced by HDPE type.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenolysis has the potential to convert high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), which comprises about 30&#8201;% of plastic waste, into valuable alkanes.

         <title>Discovery and Mechanistic Elucidation of NQO1&#8208;Bioactivatable Small Molecules That Overcome Resistance to Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degraders hold the promise to efficiently inactivate previously intractable disease&#8208;relevant targets. Unlike traditional inhibitors, degraders act substoichiometrically and rely on the hijacked proteolysis machinery, which can also act as an entry point for resistance. To fully harness the potential of targeted protein degradation, it is crucial to comprehend resistance mechanisms and formulate effective strategies to overcome them. We conducted a chemical screening to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cancer cells that exhibit widespread resistance to degraders. Comparative profiling followed by tailored optimization delivered the small molecule RBS&#8208;10, which shows preferential cytotoxicity against cells pan&#8208;resistant to degraders. Multiomics deconvolution of the mechanism of action revealed that RBS&#8208;10 acts as a prodrug bioactivated by the oxidoreductase enzyme NQO1, which is highly overexpressed in our resistance models. Collectively, our work informs on NQO1 as an actionable vulnerability to overcome resistance to degraders and as a biomarker to selectively exploit bioactivatable prodrugs in cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;mediated electrochemical nitrogen&#160;reduction reaction&#160;(Li&#8208;NRR) completely eschews the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred in aqueous system, whereas the continuous deposition of lithium readily blocks the active sites and further reduces the reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose an innovative in situ&#160;Li migration strategy to realize that Li substitutes Mn sites in &#955;&#8208;MnO2 instead of evolving into the dead&#160;Li. Comprehensive characterizations&#160;corroborate that the intercalation of Li+&#160;at high voltage breaks the structural integrity of MnO6&#160;octahedron and further triggers unique Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions, which promotes the spin state regulation of Mn sites to generate the ameliorative eg&#160;orbital configuration and accelerates N&#8801;N bond cleavage via eg&#8208;&#963;&#160;and eg&#8208;&#960;*&#160;interaction. To this end, the resulted cationic disordered LiMnO4&#160;delivers the recorded highest NH3&#160;yield rate of 220 &#956;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2&#160;and a Faradaic efficiency (FE)&#160;83.80% in organic electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Synthesis of Amine&#8208;Free CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets for Stable, Pure&#8208;Blue Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) have demonstrated excellent optical properties for light&#8208;emitting applications and achieved tunable blue luminescence through thickness control. However, their translation into electronic devices has lagged behind due to poor colloidal and film stability. The main reason for this is the deprotonation of their surface&#8208;capped ammonium passivating ligands, resulting in NPL aggregation. Here we report the first facile synthesis of amine&#8208;free pure&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 NPLs with outstanding thermal and light stability. This is achieved by utilizing an amine&#8208;free phosphine oxide route with a surface capping molecule exhibiting large steric hindrance to prevent NPL aggregation. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D&#8208;NMR) spectroscopy suggests slower ligand exchange in amine&#8208;free NPLs compared to the conventional NPLs, which can be attributed to the strong binding strength of the designated ligand. Consequently, the amine&#8208;free NPLs exhibited superior stability against radiation, heat and moisture. We further demonstrate the importance of acid&#8208;base equilibrium in this amine&#8208;free synthesis route. Through solvent neutralization and passivation with various alkali carbonates, the resulting NPLs attained near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and pure blue emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Microenvironment of Single Atoms by Switching Support Crystallinity for Industrial Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is critical to optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we innovatively propose a strategy to improve the local reaction environment of Ru single atoms by precisely switching the crystallinity of the support from high crystalline and low crystalline, which significantly improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity.  The Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on low&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8208;LC&#8208;Ni(OH)2) reconstructs the distribution balance of the interfacial ions due to the activation effect of metal dangling bonds on the support. Single&#8208;site Ru with a low oxidation state induces the aggregation of hydronium ions (H3O+), leading to the formation of a local acidic microenvironment in alkaline media, breaking the pH&#8208;dependent HER activity. As a comparison, the Ru single&#8208;atom catalyst anchored on high&#8208;crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru&#8208;HC&#8208;Ni(OH)2) exhibits a sluggish Volmer step and a conventional local reaction environment. As expected, Ru&#8208;LC&#8208;Ni(OH)2 requires low overpotentials of 9 and 136 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline conditions and operates stably at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for 500 h in an alkaline seawater anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. This study provides a new perspective for constructing highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Silver Clusters Stabilized by Lacunary Polyoxometalates with Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses of atomically precise silver (Ag) clusters stabilized by multidentate lacunary polyoxometalate (POM) ligands have been emerging as a promising but challenging research direction, the combination of redox&#8208;active POM ligands and silver clusters will render them unexpected geometric structures and catalytic properties. Herein, we report the successful construction of two structurally&#8208;new lacunary POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters, TBA6H14Ag14(DPPB)4(CH3CN)9[Ag24(Si2W18O66)3]&#183;10CH3CN&#183;9H2O ({Ag24(Si2W18O66)3}, TBA = tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium, DPPB = butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylbis[diphenylphosphine]) and TBA14H6Ag9Na2(H2O)9[Ag27(Si2W18O66)3]&#183;8CH3CN&#183;10H2O ({Ag27(Si2W18O66)3}), using a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal approach. Under otherwise identical synthetic conditions, the molecular structures of two POM&#8208;stabilized Ag clusters could be readily tuned by the addition of different organic ligands. In both compounds, the central trefoil&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped {Ag24}14+ and {Ag27}17+ clusters bearing 10 delocalized valence electrons are stabilized by three C&#8208;shaped {Si2W18O66} units. The femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed the rapid charge transfer between {Ag24}14+ core and {Si2W18O66} ligands. Both compounds have been pioneeringly investigated as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to HCOOH with a high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Azahomocorannulenyl Cations and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloheptatrienyl (tropyl) molecules are representative&#160;nonalternant hydrocarbons that&#160;offer interesting chemistry due to their unique structures and properties. However, there have been a limited number of polycyclic aromatic tropyl cations and radicals reported in the literature. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of azahomocorannulene derivatives, where the key reactions are 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides with dibenzotropone and a subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the obtained azahomocorannulenyl cation and radical adopt planar structures and exhibit unique packing structures. Their electronic and optical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically to reveal their aromatic character.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Regulation of Multiple Resonance Distribution Regions of a B,N&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon to Customize Its BT2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, boron (B)/nitrogen (N)&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by multiple resonances (MR), have attracted significant attention owing to their remarkable features of efficient narrowband emissions with small full width at half maxima (FWHMs). However, developing ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;green emitters that comply with the Broadcast Service Television 2020 (BT2020) standard remains challenging. Precise regulation of the MR distribution regions allows simultaneously achieving the emission maximum, FWHM value, and spectral shape that satisfy the BT2020 standard. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule TPABO&#8208;DICz exhibited ultrapure green emission with a dominant peak at 515 nm, an extremely small FWHM of 17 nm, and Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.76). The corresponding bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a remarkably high CIEy value (0.74) and maximum external quantum efficiency (25.8%). Notably, the top&#8208;emitting OLED achieved nearly BT2020 green color (CIE: 0.14, 0.79) and exhibited a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art maximum current efficiency of 226.4 cd A&#8208;1, thus fully confirming the effectiveness of the above strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Persistent Zero Area Compressibility over a Wide Pressure Range in Cu2GeO4 by Microscopic Orthogonal&#8208;Braiding Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero area compressibility (ZAC) is an extremely rare mechanical response that exhibits an invariant two&#8208;dimensional size under hydrostatic pressure. All known ZAC materials are constructed from units in two dimensions as a whole. Here, we propose another strategy to obtain the ZAC by microscopically orthogonal&#8208;braiding one&#8208;dimensional zero compressibility strips. Accordingly, ZAC is identified in a copper&#8208;based compound with a planar [CuO4] unit, Cu2GeO4, that possesses an area compressibility as low as 1.58(26) TPa&#8208;1 over a wide pressure range from ~0 GPa to 21.22 GPa. Based on our structural analysis, the subtle counterbalance between the shrinkage of [CuO4] and the expansion effect from the increase in the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle attributes to the ZAC response. High&#8208;pressure Raman spectroscopy, in combination with first&#8208;principles calculations, shows that the electron transfer from in&#8208;plane bonding dx2&#8208;y2 to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nonbonding dz2 orbitals within copper atoms causes the counterintuitive extension of the [CuO4]&#8208;[CuO4] dihedral angle under pressure. Our study provides an understanding on the pressure&#8208;induced structural evolution of copper&#8208;based oxides at an electronic level and facilitates a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;dimensional anomalous mechanical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Derived Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (py&#8209;mNHOs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic polarization allows access to electron&#8208;rich olefins that have found application as organocatalysts, ligands, or nucleophiles. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of 3&#8208;methylpyridinium&#8208;derived mesoionic olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs). We used a DFT&#8208;supported design concept, which showed that the introduction of aryl groups in the 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 4&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions of the heterocyclic core allowed the kinetic stabilization of the novel mesoionic compounds. Tolman electronic parameters indicate that py&#8208;mNHOs are remarkably strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands toward transition metals and main group Lewis acids. Additionally, they are among the strongest nucleophiles on the Mayr reactivity scale. In reactions of py&#8208;mNHOs with electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems, a gradual transition from the formation of zwitterionic adducts via stepwise to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was observed experimentally and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrastrong Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Uranium&#8208;Organic Frameworks Leading to Inverse Luminescence Temperature Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;phonon interactions, crucial in condensed matter, are rarely seen in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Detecting these interactions typically involves analyzing luminescence in lanthanide&#8208; or actinide&#8208;based compounds. Prior studies on Ln&#8208; and Ac&#8208;based MOFs at high temperatures revealed additional peaks, but these were too faint for thorough analysis. In our research, we fabricated a high&#8208;quality, crystalline uranium&#8208;based MOF (KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1) thin film using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. Under UV light, this film showed two distinct "hot bands," indicating a strong electron&#8208;phonon interaction. At 77 K, these bands were absent, but at 300 K, a new emission band appeared with half the intensity of the main luminescence. Surprisingly, a second hot band emerged above 320 K, deviating from previous findings in rare&#8208;earth compounds. We conducted a detailed ab&#8208;initio analysis employing time&#8208;dependent density function theory to understand this unusual behaviour and to identify the lattice vibration responsible for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1 film's hot&#8208;band emission was then utilized to create a highly sensitive, single&#8208;compound optical thermometer. This underscores the potential of high&#8208;quality MOF thin films in exploiting the unique luminescence of lanthanides and actinides for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Electronegativity Mn&#8208;Contraction of PtMn Nanodendrites Boosts Oxygen Reduction Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum metal (PtM, M=Ni, Fe, Co) alloys catalysts show high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity due to their well&#8208;known strain and ligand effects. However, these PtM alloys usually suffer from a deficient ORR durability in acidic environment as the alloyed metal is prone to be dissolved due to its high electronegativity. Herein, we report a new class of PtMn alloy nanodendrite catalyst with low&#8208;electronegativity Mn&#8208;contraction for boosting the oxygen reduction durability of fuel cells. The moderate strain in PtMn, induced by Mn contraction, yields optimal oxygen reduction activity at 0.53 A mg&#8208;1 at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Most importantly, we show that relative to well&#8208;known high&#8208;electronegativity Ni&#8208;based Pt alloy counterpart, the PtMn nanodendrite catalyst experiences less transition metals'&#160;dissolution in acidic solution and achieves an outstanding mass activity retention of 96% after 10,000 degradation cycles. Density functional theory calculation reveals that PtMn alloys are thermodynamically more stable than PtNi alloys in terms of formation enthalpy and cohesive energy. The PtMn nanodendrite&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly delivers an outstanding peak power density of 1.36 W cm&#8208;2 at a low Pt loading and high&#8208;performance retention over 50 h operations at 0.6 V in H2&#8208;O2 hydrogen fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photoelectrochemical Oxidation of Glycerol to Glyceric Acid on (002) Facets Exposed WO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value&#8208;added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, a 73% GLYA selectivity and a 39% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW&#183;cm&#8208;2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Nitroalkanes with (Hetero)aryl Bromides/Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aryl substituted nitroalkanes are valuable synthetic building blocks that can be easily converted into a&#8208;aryl substituted aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, as well as amines. Herein, an efficient Cu/oxalamide&#8208;catalyzed coupling between nitroalkanes and (hetero)aryl halides (Br, I) was developed to direct access highly diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted nitroalkanes. Compared with the current state of art, this protocol is more environmentally friendly and practical for synthetic chemists. This approach is characterized by a broad substrate scope on both nitroalkane part (primary nitroalkanes and nitromethane) and sp2 halide part ((hetero)aryl bromides/iodides and alkenyl bromides/iodides). The excellent functional group tolerance was observed, which would enable real world synthetic applications. More importantly, TON of current transformation reached to 3640, when some aryl iodides were used as coupling partners. This represents currently the highest catalyst turnover for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation of nitroalkanes. Furthermore, the successful application in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and synthesis of a known retinoid X receptor (RXR) antagonist exemplified its synthetic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Preparation of Carbohydrate&#8208;Containing Adjuvants Based on Self&#8208;Assembling Glycopeptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugates (GPCs) were synthesized to produce uniform nanoribbons with homogeneous oligosaccharides appended in a multivalent array. Some of the conjugates exhibited immunostimulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are intriguing biomolecules possessing diverse biological activities, including immune stimulating capability. However, their biomedical applications have been limited by their complex and heterogeneous structures. In this study, we have utilized a self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugate (GPC) system to produce uniform nanoribbons appending homogeneous oligosaccharides with multivalency. This system successfully translates the nontrivial structural differences of oligomannoses into varied binding affinities to C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs). We have shown that GPCs could promote the CLR&#8208;mediated endocytosis of ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, and two mannotriose&#8208;modified peptides F3m2 and F3m5 exhibit potent activity in inducing antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation, as indicated by increased CD86 and MHCII expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that GPCs, combined with OVA antigen, significantly enhanced OVA&#8208;specific antibody production. Specifically, F3m2 and F3m5 exhibited the highest immunostimulatory effects, eliciting both Th1&#8208; and Th2&#8208;biased immune responses and promoting differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+&#8197;T cells. These findings highlight the potential of GPCs as vaccine adjuvants, and showcase their versatility in exploiting the biological functions of carbohydrates.

         <title>Spiky Artificial Peroxidases with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Pair Sites for Combating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for efficient and selective ROS&#8208;catalysis has been reported. We demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive ROS (&#8901;OH and HClO) production, which efficiently eliminate MRSA and accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity.







Abstract
With the sharp rise of antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens worldwide, it is of enormous importance to create new strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria. Here, we create an iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase (POD) with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for combating methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The V&#8208;Fe2O3 can reach nearly 100&#8201;% bacterial inhibition over a long period by efficiently oxidizing the lipid membrane. Our wound disinfection results identify that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can not only efficiently eliminate MRSA and their biofilm but also accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity. This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.

         <title>Diversification of a Novel &#945;&#8208;Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A previously underexplored &#945;&#8208;GalCer chemical space was discovered and diversified to elicit very high antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular immune responses. The multicomponent derivatization of the new glycolipid hotspot allowed the incorporation either of extra functionalities that enhanced the adjuvant effect or conjugation handles that are useful for the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines.







Abstract
The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;&#8208;galactosyl ceramide (&#945;&#8208;GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B&#8208;cell activation. Herein, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;&#8208;GalCer skeleton, namely the N&#8208;substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen&#8208;specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered by either the parenteral or the mucosal route, as compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogues showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogue previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.

         <title>Rapid Formation of Non&#8208;canonical Phospholipid Membranes by Chemoselective Amide&#8208;Forming Ligations with Hydroxylamines

Bioorthogonal de novo phospholipid synthesis utilizing the reactions between hydroxylamine and &#945;&#8208;ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) enables the rapid formation of biomimetic membranes under physiological pH conditions, using reactant concentrations in the micromolar range. Additionally, these reactions are biocompatible and can be performed in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
There has been increasing interest in methods to generate synthetic lipid membranes as key constituents of artificial cells or to develop new tools for remodeling membranes in living cells. However, the biosynthesis of phospholipids involves elaborate enzymatic pathways that are challenging to reconstitute in vitro. An alternative approach is to use chemical reactions to non&#8208;enzymatically generate natural or non&#8208;canonical phospholipids de novo. Previous reports have shown that synthetic lipid membranes can be formed in situ using various ligation chemistries, but these methods lack biocompatibility and/or suffer from slow kinetics at physiological pH. Thus, it would be valuable to develop chemoselective strategies for synthesizing phospholipids from water&#8208;soluble precursors that are compatible with synthetic or living cells Here, we demonstrate that amide&#8208;forming ligations between lipid precursors bearing hydroxylamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) can be used to prepare non&#8208;canonical phospholipids at physiological pH conditions. The generated amide&#8208;linked phospholipids spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into cell&#8208;like micron&#8208;sized vesicles similar to natural phospholipid membranes. We show that lipid synthesis using KAT ligation proceeds extremely rapidly, and the high selectivity and biocompatibility of the approach facilitates the in situ synthesis of phospholipids and associated membranes in living cells.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanocores Initiated Construction of Smart DNA&#8208;Polymer Microgels with Programmable and Regulable Functions and Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Locomotion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization reaction of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nanoparticles under sonication allows the construction of smart core/shell microgels. Multifunctional DNA microgels with tunable properties were prepared by introducing different vinyl monomers and functional DNA structures and controlling the polymerization process. The photothermal effect of LM NPs also contributed to the NIR&#8208;driven motion of these smart microgels.







Abstract
Due to their sequence&#8208;directed functions and excellent biocompatibility, smart DNA microgels have attracted considerable research interest, and the combination of DNA microgels with functional nanostructures can further expand their applications in biosensing and biomedicine. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) exhibiting both fluidic and metallic properties hold great promise for the development of smart soft materials; in particular, LM particles upon sonication can mediate radical&#8208;initiated polymerization reactions, thus allowing the combination of LMs and polymeric matrix to construct &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; materials. Herein, by forming active surfaces under sonication, LM nanoparticles (LM NPs) initiated localized radical polymerization reactions allow the combination of functional DNA units and different polymeric backbones to yield multifunctional core/shell microgels. The localized polymerization reaction allows fine control of the microgel compositions, and smart DNA microgels with tunable catalytic activities can be constructed. Moreover, due to the excellent photothermal effect of LM NPs, the resulting temperature gradient between microgels and surrounding solution upon NIR light irradiation can drive the oriented locomotion of the microgels, and remote control of the activity of these smart microgels can be achieved. These microgels may hold promise for various applications, such as the development of in vivo and in vitro biosensing and drug delivery systems.

         <title>Tailoring Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper by Reactive Ionic Liquid and Native Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic exchange of the hydrogen between the CO2 absorbed cation and the anion of a functional ionic liquid modulates the electroreduction of CO2 over copper as examined by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The microenvironment created by the ionic liquid enables conversion products beyond CO with reduced potential requirements, increased current, and product selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) on copper (Cu) shows promise for higher&#8208;value products beyond CO. However, challenges such as the limited CO2 solubility, high overpotentials, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical realization. We propose a functionalized ionic liquid (IL) which generates ion&#8208;CO2 adducts and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) upon CO2 absorption to modulate CO2RR on Cu in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. As revealed by transient voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) complemented with image charge augmented quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanics (IC&#8208;QM/MM) computations, a unique microenvironment is constructed. In this microenvironment, the catalytic activity is primarily governed by the IL and HBD concentrations; former controlling the double layer thickness and the latter modulating the local proton availability. This translates to ample CO2 availability, reduced overpotential, and suppressed HER where C4 products are obtained. This study deepens the understanding of electrolyte effects in CO2RR and the role of IL ions towards electrocatalytic microenvironment design.

         <title>Capturing Doublet Intermediate Emitters by Chemically Crosslinking Confinement towards Spatiotemporal Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical intermediates with red emission are captured by a strategy of chemically crosslinked confinement. The emitters have unique photochemical activity and work in spatiotemporal encryption.







Abstract
Photoluminescence is one of the most meticulous ways to manipulate light energy. Typical photoluminescent emitters are mostly stable substances with a pure photophysical process of spontaneous photon&#8208;emission from their excited states. Intermediate emitters are elusive attributing to their synchronous energy transfer process including photophysical and incomplete photochemical pathways. An intermediate emitter containing radicals is more difficult to be observed due to its inherent chemical reactivity. Here, these challenges are overcome by spontaneously formed space limitations in polymer crosslinking networks meanwhile chemically active intermediates are captured. These doublet intermediates exhibit unique long&#8208;wavelength emissions under chemically crosslinking confinement conditions, and their luminous mechanism provides a novel perspective for designing intermediate emitters with liquid&#8208;crystal character and photoresponsive features towards spatiotemporal encryption, promising for the detection of photochemical reactions and the development of fascinating luminescent systems.

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes has been realized, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile. Detailed mechanistic studies have been explored by experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
Axially chiral open&#8208;chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile (&#916;G&#8800;(rac)=26.6&#8211;28.0&#8197;kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline N&#8208;oxide system reveal that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6&#8208;diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the arene C&#8722;H bond and the Rh&#8722;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8722;C reductive elimination being enantio&#8208;determining and turnover&#8208;limiting. The DFT&#8208;established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies.

     alt="Rhodium(I)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6-Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium(I)-catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6-diynes with three distinct classes of arenes has been realized, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3-dienes that are conformationally labile. Detailed mechanistic studies have been explored by experimental and computational methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral open-chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)-catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6-diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3-dienes that are conformationally labile (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;)=26.6&#8211;28.0&#8197;kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide system reveal that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6-diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by &#963;-bond metathesis between the arene C&#8722;H bond and the Rh&#8722;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8722;C reductive elimination being enantio-determining and turnover-limiting. The DFT-established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies. The coupled products of quinoline &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides undergo facile visible light-induced intramolecular oxygen-atom transfer, affording chiral epoxides with complete axial-to-central chirality transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diphosphine Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chelate&#8208;Assisted Inner&#8208;Selective Migratory Hydroarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones and alkenyl azahetereoarenes have been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;aryl or &#8208;alkenyl ketones or heteroarenes in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
The precise control of the regioselectivity in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization of alkenes remains a big challenge. With a transient ketimine directing group, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones has been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source for the first time. The key to this success is the use of a diphosphine ligand, which is capable of the generation of a Ni(II)&#8208;H species in the presence of alkyl bromide, and enabling the efficient migratory insertion of alkene into Ni(II)&#8208;H species and the sequent rapid chain walking process. The present approach diminishes organosilanes reductant, tolerates a wide array of complex functionalities with excellent regioselective control. Moreover, this catalytic system could also be applied to the migratory hydroarylation of alkenyl azahetereoarenes, thus providing a general approach for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;aryl heteroaryl motifs with wide potential applications in pharmaceutical discovery.

         <title>Active Sites in Cr(III)&#8208;Based Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts from Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Supported XAS and EPR Spectroscopy
</title>

Ethylene polymerization catalyst prepared by grafting Cr[CH(SiMe3)2]3 on SiO2 contains well&#8208;defined Cr(III) alkyl surface sites, as shown using a combination of ML&#8208;supported&#8208;XAS and EPR spectroscopies. Furthermore, it is also possible to show by EPR that Cr(III) alkyl sites are competent for olefin insertion.







Abstract
The ethylene polymerization Phillips catalyst has been employed for decades and is central to the polymer industry. While Cr(III) alkyl species are proposed to be the propagating sites, there is so far no direct experimental evidence for such proposal. In this work, by coupling Surface organometallic chemistry, EPR spectroscopy, and machine learning&#8208;supported XAS studies, we have studied the electronic structure of well&#8208;defined silica&#8208;supported Cr(III) alkyls and identified the presence of several surface species in high and low&#8208;spin states, associated with different coordination environments. Notably, low&#8208;spin Cr(III) sites are shown to participate in ethylene polymerization, indicating that similar Cr(III) alkyl species could be involved in the related Phillips catalyst.

         <title>Significant Roles of Surface Hydrides in Enhancing the Performance of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrides into the lattice of BaTiO3 can notably enhance the methanol yield over a supported Cu catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation due to the direct participation of surface hydrides in the reaction and the modified electronic property of the interfacial sites in the Cu/ BaTiO2.8H0.2 catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the anionic site of catalyst supports can impact reaction pathways by creating active sites on the support or influencing metal&#8208;support interactions when using supported metal nanoparticles. This study focuses on CO2 hydrogenation over supported Cu nanoparticles, revealing a 3&#8208;fold increase in methanol yield when replacing oxygen anions with hydrides in the perovskite support (Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 yields ~146&#8197;mg/h/gCu vs. Cu/BaTiO3 yields ~50&#8197;mg/h/gCu). The contrast suggests that significant roles are played by the support hydrides in the reaction. Temperature programmed reaction and isotopic labelling studies indicate that BaTiO2.8H0.2 surface hydride species follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation, promoting methanol production. High&#8208;pressure steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) studies suggest that Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 possesses both a higher density and more active and selective sites for methanol production compared to Cu/BaTiO3. An operando high&#8208;pressure diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8208;SSITKA study shows that formate species are the major surface intermediates over both catalysts, and the subsequent hydrogenation steps of formate are likely rate&#8208;limiting. However, the catalytic reactivity of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 towards the formate species is much higher than Cu/BaTiO3, likely due to the altered electronic structure of interface Cu sites by the hydrides in the support as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;assembly of Copolymer&#8208;Capped Nanoparticles into Colloidal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of binary nanoparticles capped with a layer of complementary copolymer ligands into well&#8208;defined colloidal molecules. By varying the irradiation duration and the order of mixing and irradiating, the assembly process yields clustered ABx and linear (AB)y structures (x is the coordination number of NP&#8208;Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters in the linear structure) at high precision and tunability.







Abstract
Colloidal molecules (CMs) are precisely defined assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) that mimic the structure of real molecules, but externally programming the precise self&#8208;assembly of CMs is still challenging. In this work, we show that the photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of complementary copolymer&#8208;capped binary NPs can be precisely controlled to form clustered ABx or linear (AB)y CMs at high yield (x is the coordination number of NP&#8208;Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters). Under UV light irradiation, photolabile p&#8208;methoxyphenacyl groups of copolymers on NP&#8208;A*s are converted to carboxyl groups (NP&#8208;A), which react with tertiary amines of copolymers on NP&#8208;B to trigger the directional NP bonding. The x value of ABx can be precisely controlled between 1 and 3 by varying the irradiation duration and hence the amount of carboxyl groups generated on NP&#8208;As. Moreover, when NP&#8208;A* and NP&#8208;B are irradiated after mixing, the assembly process generates AB clusters or linear (AB)y structures with alternating sequence of the binary NPs. This assembly approach offers a simple yet non&#8208;invasive way to externally regulate the formation of various CMs on demand without the need of redesigning the surface chemistry of NPs for use in drug delivery, diagnostics, optoelectronics, and plasmonic devices.

In this work, we show that the photo-induced self-assembly of complementary copolymer-capped binary NPs can be precisely controlled to form clustered &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; or linear (&lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; CMs at high yield (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is the coordination number of NP-&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;s, and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is the repeating unit number of &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt; clusters). Under UV light irradiation, photolabile &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-methoxyphenacyl groups of copolymers on NP-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;*s are converted to carboxyl groups (NP-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;), which react with tertiary amines of copolymers on NP-&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; to trigger the directional NP bonding. The &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; value of &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; can be precisely controlled between 1 and 3 by varying the irradiation duration and hence the amount of carboxyl groups generated on NP-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;s. Moreover, when NP-&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;* and NP-&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; are irradiated after mixing, the assembly process generates &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt; clusters or linear (&lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structures with alternating sequence of the binary NPs. This assembly approach offers a simple yet non-invasive way to externally regulate the formation of various CMs on demand without the need of redesigning the surface chemistry of NPs for use in drug delivery, diagnostics, optoelectronics, and plasmonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analgesic Buxus alkaloids with Enhanced Selectivity for the Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Gated Calcium Channel Cav3.2&#8201;over Cav3.1&#8201;through a New Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is important to explore modulators with heightened selectivity index (SI) for a subtype of low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ channels (Cav3.1&#8211;3.3) for drug development. Among 23 Buxus alkaloids featuring three distinct carbon skeletons, 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type compounds 9 and 10 were identified as a novel type of Cav3.2 inhibitor. With a unique binding mode, they exhibit highly enhanced preference for Cav3.2 over Cav3.1 and robust analgesic effects.







Abstract
Low&#8208;voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels (LVGCCs; Cav3.1&#8208;3.3) represent promising drug targets for epilepsy, pain, and essential tremor. At present, modulators with heightened selectivity for a subtype of LVGCCs are still highly desired. In this study we explored three classes of Buxus alkaloids and identified 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artanes Buxusemine H and Buxusemine L (BXSL) as an unprecedented type of Cav3.2 inhibitors. Particularly, BXSL exhibited Cav3.2 inhibition comparable to Z944, a non&#8208;subtype&#8208;selective LVGCCs inhibitor under clinical trial. While lacking specificity for Cav3.3, BXSL showed a 30&#8208;fold selectivity of Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. As compared to several well&#8208;known inhibitors, the experimental and computational studies suggested BXSL exhibits a distinct binding mode to Cav3.2, notably through the essential interaction with serine&#8208;1543 in domain III. Furthermore, BXSL showed minimal impact on various recombinant and native nociceptive ion channels, while significantly reducing the excitability of isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. Animal studies in wild&#8208;type and Cav3.2 knock&#8208;out mice revealed that BXSL (5&#8197;mg/kg), by inhibiting Cav3.2, exhibits an analgesic effect equivalent to Z944 (10&#8197;mg/kg) or mibefradil (10&#8197;mg/kg). Moreover, we proposed a structural rationale for the high selectivity of 9(10/19)abeo&#8208;artane&#8208;type alkaloids towards Cav3.2 over Cav3.1. This study introduces a novel analgesic agent and valuable molecular insight for structure&#8208;based innovative Cav3.2 drug development.

         <title>Enzymatic Upcycling of PET Waste to Calcium Terephthalate for Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully demonstrates the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based production of calcium terephthalate from waste PET. The incorporation of Ca2+ during the production process not only enhanced the efficiency of enzymatic plastic depolymerization but also reduced the base consumption. Consequently, this approach has proven to be a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly method for upcycling PET into calcium terephthalate.







Abstract
Biotechnological recycling offers a promising solution to address the environmental concerns associated with waste plastics, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), widely utilized in packaging materials and textiles. To advance the development of a bio&#8208;based circular plastic economy, innovative upcycling strategies capable of generating higher&#8208;value products are needed. In this study, we enhanced the enzymatic depolymerization of waste PET by incorporating highly concentrated calcium ions (up to 1&#8197;m) to the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by the best currently known enzyme LCCICCG. The presence of calcium ions not only improved the thermal stability and activity of the biocatalyst but also significantly reduced the consumption of base required to maintain optimal pH levels. Employing optimized conditions at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h, we successfully converted &#8776;84&#8201;% of the waste PET (200&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) into solid hydrated calcium terephthalate (CaTP&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O) as the primary product instead of soluble terephthalate salt. CaTP&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O was easily purified and employed as a raw material for battery electrode production, exhibiting an initial reversible specific capacity of 164.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Through techno&#8208;economic analysis, we conclusively demonstrated that the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based synthesis of CaTP is a superior PET upcycling strategy than the secondary synthesis method employing recycled terephthalic acid.

         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.







Abstract
Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8208;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8208;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Hydroacylations under Heterogeneous Chiral Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts were developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's without the leaching of Rh. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and, in sequential&#8208;flow reactions, the flow syntheses of value&#8208;added chemicals were demonstrated.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H bond functionalizations have become efficient methods for the synthesis of complex optically active molecules. Heterogeneous catalysts for this chemistry remain largely unexplored despite the advantages they offer in terms of ease of separation and reuse of catalysts. Herein, we report the development of heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. Heterogeneous catalysts could be prepared simply by mixing supports and Rh complexes. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's.

&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts were developed for continuous-flow enantioselective hydroacylations. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's without the leaching of Rh. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and, in sequential-flow reactions, the flow syntheses of value-added chemicals were demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H bond functionalizations have become efficient methods for the synthesis of complex optically active molecules. Heterogeneous catalysts for this chemistry remain largely unexplored despite the advantages they offer in terms of ease of separation and reuse of catalysts. Herein, we report the development of heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts for continuous-flow enantioselective hydroacylations. Heterogeneous catalysts could be prepared simply by mixing supports and Rh complexes. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a turnover number &amp;gt;300 was achieved without the leaching of Rh species. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and in sequential-flow reactions with other heterogeneous catalysts, the syntheses of biologically active molecules and functional materials were demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dearomative Insertion of Fluoroalkyl Carbenes into Azoles Leading to Fluoroalkyl Heterocycles with a Quaternary Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy was developed for the direct conversion of azoles into various heterocyclic frameworks containing fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted quaternary centers through dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The skeletal ring expansion of heteroarenes through carbene insertion is gaining popularity in synthetic chemistry. Efficient strategies for heterocyclic ring expansion to access heterocycles containing a fluoroalkyl quaternary carbon center through fluoroalkyl carbene insertion are highly desirable because of their broad applications in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a general strategy for the dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion of azoles using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as fluoroalkyl carbene precursors, resulting in ring&#8208;expanded heterocycles in excellent yields with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. The broad generality of this methodology in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically interesting bioactive molecules and versatile transformations of the products has been demonstrated.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Alkylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides with Conjugated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild electrocatalytic system is reported for the reductive alkylation of primary, secondary, or tertiary alkyl chlorides with conjugated alkenes.







Abstract
Reactions of unactivated alkyl chlorides under mild and sustainable conditions are rare compared to those of alkyl bromides or iodides. As a result, synthetic methods capable of modifying the vast chemical space of chloroalkane reagents, wastes, and materials are limited. We report the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive addition of unactivated alkyl chlorides to conjugated alkenes. Co&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkyl chlorides is performed under electroreductive conditions, and the resulting reactions constitute formal alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond formation. In addition to developing an operationally simple methodology, detailed mechanistic studies provide insights into the elementary steps of a proposed catalytic cycle. In particular, we propose a switch in the mechanism of C&#8722;Cl bond activation from nucleophilic substitution to halogen atom abstraction, which is critical for efficiently generating alkyl radicals. These mechanistic insights were leveraged in designing ligands that enable couplings of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenide rocksalt crystals are associated with metavalent bonding (MVB), a recent subject of debate. In this study, we investigate various 2D lattices of chalcogenides to understand MVB. Honeycomb lattices adhere to the 8&#8208;N rule and are covalently bonded. Square and orthorhombic structures display in&#8208;plane MVB, driven by p&#8208;p orbital interactions, with cationic lone pairs inducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puckering.







Abstract
An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of Group&#8197;IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of Group&#8197;IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored. While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, with cationic lone pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with hydrocarbons is of substantial interest and challenge. Herein, we achieved the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with up to 99&#8201;% ee in moderate to good yields, thus providing an elegant access to optically active carbonyl compounds. Density functional theory calculations suggest a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway.







Abstract
The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99&#8201;% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88&#8201;% yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments were made to gain insight into the nature of C&#8722;C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.

An unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of esters and aldehydes from methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol has been developed, allowing for customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the production of value&#8208;added methyl methacrylate (MMA), surpassing the current industrial processes to significantly lower the production costs.







Abstract
Methanol serves as a versatile building&#8208;block for various commodity chemicals, and the development of industrially promising strategies for its conversion remains the ultimate goal in methanol chemistry. In this study, we design a dual Cu&#8722;Cs catalytic system that enables a one&#8208;step direct conversion of methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol into high value&#8208;added esters/aldehydes, with customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. Cu&#8722;Cs at a millimeter&#8208;scale intimacy triggers methanol dehydrogenation and condensation, involving proton transfer, aldol formation, and aldol condensation, to obtain unsaturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 76.3&#8201;% and 31.1&#8201;%, respectively. Cu&#8722;Cs at a micrometer&#8208;scale intimacy significantly promotes mass transfer of intermediates across catalyst interfaces and their subsequent hydrogenation to saturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 67.6&#8201;% and 93.1&#8201;%, respectively. Conversely, Cu&#8722;Cs at a nanometer&#8208;scale intimacy alters reaction pathway with a similar energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step, but blocks the acidic&#8208;basic sites and diverts the reaction to byproducts. More importantly, an unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is achieved by further tailoring Cu and Cs distribution across the reaction bed in the configuration of Cu&#8722;Cs||Cs, outperforming the existing industrial processes and saving at least 15&#8201;% of production costs.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensionally arranged quantum&#8208;dot superstructure has been created by using a supramolecular polymer template composed of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cholesterol derivatives. This superstructure is not obtained by the self&#8208;assembly of the quantum dots in the absence of the template. The closely arranged quantum dots allows efficient energy transfer between them.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives containing two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing the SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures through van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Gating of Selective Bacterial Membrane Interaction and Enhanced Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photoswitchable bio&#8208;interface through ligand functionalization on 2D&#8208;MoS2, achieving differential&#8208;interactions&#8208;based Gram&#8208;selective antibacterial activity that enables effective wound healing applications.







Abstract
Reversible biointerfaces are essential for on&#8208;demand molecular recognition to regulate stimuli&#8208;responsive bioactivity such as specific interactions with cell membranes. The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells. Herein, we introduce a 2D&#8208;MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene that interacts selectively with either Gram&#8208;positive or Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a light&#8208;gated fashion. The trans conformation (trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) selectively kills Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2), under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive strains. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits higher affinity towards the membrane of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria compared to trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2. In case of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 and generates intracellular ROS to kill the bacteria. While the trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram&#8208;negative bacterial cells, cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H&#8208;bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo&#8208;controlled Gram&#8208;selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain&#8208;specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration, 0.65&#8197;&#956;g/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain&#8208;selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS) Assay for Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of Antibodies
</title>

We demonstrate the ultrasensitive, specific, selective and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using a strategy that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification.







Abstract
Here we report the development of a method for the electrochemical ultrasensitive detection of antibodies that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification. The platform, termed Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS), is based on the use of antigen&#8208;DNA conjugates that, upon the bivalent binding of a specific target antibody, induce the release of an enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand from a preformed duplex. Such enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand can then be electrochemically detected with a disposable electrode with high sensitivity. We applied ELIDIS to demonstrate the sensitive (limit of detection in the picomolar range), specific and multiplexed detection of five different antibodies including three clinically relevant ones. ELIDIS is also rapid (it only requires two reaction steps), works well in complex media (serum) and is cost&#8208;effective. A direct comparison with a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of Cetuximab demonstrates the promising features of ELIDIS as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care platform for antibodies detection.

         <title>Well&#8208;defined N3C1&#8208;anchored Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N3C1&#8208;anchored single metal sites in well&#8208;defined molecules are studied to make up the structure&#8208;property correlation study challenge for carbon materials. The established volcano plots and the experimental catalysis results provide possibilities of fundamental understanding of asymmetric single metal active sites for electrochemical catalysis.







Abstract
N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal&#8208;sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. However, significant challenges persist in the precise design of well&#8208;defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case&#8208;by&#8208;case reports using carbon materials as investigation targets. In this work, the well&#8208;defined molecular catalysts with N3C1&#8208;anchored SMSs, i.e., N&#8208;confused metalloporphyrins (NCPor&#8208;Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor&#8208;Ms with corresponding N4&#8208;anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrins, Por&#8208;Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor&#8208;Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor&#8208;Co also shows the highest half&#8208;wave potential of 0.83&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than that of Por&#8208;Co (0.77&#8197;V vs. RHE). Electron&#8208;rich, low band gap and regulated d&#8208;band center contribute to the high activity of NCPor&#8208;Co. This study delves into the examination of well&#8208;defined asymmetric SMS molecular catalysts, encompassing both theoretical and experimental facets. It serves as a pioneering step towards enhancing the fundamental comprehension and facilitating the development of high&#8208;performance asymmetric SMS catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-, C-, O-, S-coordinated single-metal-sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. However, significant challenges persist in the precise design of well-defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case-by-case reports using carbon materials as investigation targets. In this work, the well-defined molecular catalysts with N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-anchored SMSs, i.e., N-confused metalloporphyrins (NCPor-Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor-Ms with corresponding N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrins, Por-Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor-Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor-Co also shows the highest half-wave potential of 0.83&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than that of Por-Co (0.77&#8197;V vs. RHE). Electron-rich, low band gap and regulated &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center contribute to the high activity of NCPor-Co.

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; strategy was demonstrated to construct highly ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;loaded MMM with quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous channels for rapid CO2 transportation.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55&#8197;wt&#8201;%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF crystallization: the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgF is capable of converting the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion into a novel silver enolate&#8208;fluorophosphorane species, which enables the development of (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine via P(III)/P(V) catalysis. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study has demonstrated that the silver enolate moiety offers an alternative approach to realize an asymmetric variant merely by the introduction of an additional chiral PyBox ligand.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising of silver enolate and a fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo a Mannich reaction with aldimine, whereas the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at an asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of an achiral phosphine catalyst and a chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal [4+1] Cyclization of Benzyl Alcohols and Benzaldimines: Facile Access to Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] annulation of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines with secondary silanes has been achieved in excellent enantioselectivity to afford a range of sila&#8208;O&#8208; and sila&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycles with silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers, where the rhodium catalyst plays a dual role in the O/N&#8208;Si and C&#8208;Si coupling.







Abstract
The carbon&#8208;to&#8208;silicon switch in formation of bioactive sila&#8208;heterocycles with a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center has garnered significant interest in drug discovery. However, metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of such scaffolds is still in its infancy. Herein, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] cyclization of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines has been realized by enantioselective difunctionalization of a secondary silane reagent, affording chiral&#8208;at&#8208;silicon cyclic silyl ethers and sila&#8208;isoindolines, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the rhodium&#8208;hydride catalyst. The coupling system proceeds via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;determining dehydrogenative OH silylation of the benzyl alcohol or hydrosilylation of the imine to give an enantioenriched silyl ether or silazane intermediate, respectively. The same rhodium catalyst also enables subsequent intramolecular cyclative C&#8722;H silylation directed by the pendent Si&#8208;H group. Experimental and DFT studies have been conducted to explore the mechanism of the OH bond silylation of benzyl alcohol, where the Si&#8208;O reductive elimination from a Rh(III) hydride intermediate has been established as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Synchronous Elimination of Excess Photoinstable PbI2 and Interfacial Band Mismatch for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sufficient conversion of residual photoinstable PbI2 into robust 1D perovskite (EMIMPbI3) can improve device stability, while the formation of an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface can reduce the energetic mismatch via a single process. The optimized device delivers an efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% and a remarkable open circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V, accompanied with excellent humidity and operational stability.







Abstract
Eliminating the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI2) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two&#8208;step sequential deposition method. Here, the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) is employed to convert superfluous PbI2 to more robust 1D EMIMPbI3 which can withstand lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently, the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% with one of the highest open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two-step sequential deposition method. Here, the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is employed to convert superfluous PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to more robust 1D EMIMPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which can withstand lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently, the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28&#8201;% with one of the highest open-circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gram&#8208;level NH3 Electrosynthesis via NOx reduction on a Cu Activated Co Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis from NOx on a Cu&#8208;activated Co foam electrode was developed as a promising alternative for the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The new synthesis can convert pollutants into elevated value&#8208;added NH3 applicable for agriculture, energy storage, etc., imposing a sustainable nitrogen cycle.







Abstract
Ambient electrochemical ammonia (NH3) synthesis is one promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch route. However, the industrial requirement for the electrochemical NH3 production with amperes current densities or gram&#8208;level NH3 yield remains a grand challenge. Herein, we report the high&#8208;rate NH3 production via NO2&#8722; reduction using the Cu activated Co electrode in a bipolar membrane (BPM) assemble electrolyser, wherein BPM maintains the ion balance and the liquid level of electrolyte. Benefited from the abundant Co sites and optimal structure, the target modified Co foam electrode delivers a current density of 2.64&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 96.45&#8201;% and the high NH3 yield rate of 279.44&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H&#8208;type cell using alkaline electrolyte. Combined with in situ experiments and theoretical calculations, we found that Cu optimizes the adsorption behavior of NO2&#8722; and facilitates the hydrogenation steps on Co sites toward a rapid NO2&#8722; reduction process. Importantly, this activated Co electrode affords a large NH3 production up to 4.11&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a homemade reactor, highlighting its large&#8208;scale practical feasibility.

         <title>Fully Aromatic Self&#8208;Assembled Hole&#8208;Selective Layer toward Efficient Inverted Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Ultraviolet Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as MeO&#8208;PhPACz, is employed as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The fully aromatic configuration is crucial in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. The optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;% and excellent UV resistance.







Abstract
Ultraviolet&#8208;induced degradation has emerged as a critical stability concern impeding the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in the context of phase&#8208;unstable wide&#8208;band gap perovskite films. This study introduces a novel approach by employing a fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz), as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap PSCs. Incorporating a conjugated linker plays a pivotal role in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL on substrates, facilitating subsequent perovskite interfacial interactions, and fostering the growth of uniform perovskite films. The high&#8208;quality film could effectively suppress interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;band gap PSCs, featuring a band gap of 1.68&#8197;eV, attain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10&#8201;%. Remarkably, MeO&#8208;PhPACz demonstrates inherent UV resistance and heightened UV absorption capabilities, substantially improving UV resistance for the targeted PSCs. This characteristic holds significance for the feasibility of large&#8208;scale outdoor applications.

         <title>New Reaction Pathway of Superoxide Disproportionation Induced by a Soluble Catalyst in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations promote the intramolecular charge transfer of O2&#8722; dimers and accelerate their disproportionation in discharge and charge processes. This facilitates the reaction kinetics and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and 1O2 related side reactions to endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with small overvoltages and prolonged cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery has attracted considerable interest for high theoretical energy density, however the disproportionation of the intermediate of superoxide (O2&#8722;) during discharge and charge leads to slow reaction kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, the chemically stable ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations are employed as a soluble catalyst to alternate the pathway of O2&#8722; disproportionation and its kinetics in both the discharge and charge processes. RB captures O2&#8722; dimer and promotes their intramolecular charge transfer, and it decreases the energy barrier of the disproportionation reaction from 7.70 to 0.70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This facilitates the discharge and charge processes and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8722; and singlet oxygen related side reactions. These endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.72&#8197;V and prolonged lifespan for over 230 cycles when coupled with RuO2 catalyst. This work highlights the vital role of superoxide disproportionation for Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <title>Multi&#8208;d Electron Synergy in LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu Intermetallics Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity.







Abstract
Despite the fact that d&#8208;band center theory links the d electron structure of transition metals to their catalytic activity, it is yet unknown how the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons impacts catalytic performance. Herein, novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi0.5Co0.5Ru has an overpotential of 43mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi&#8208;d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.

Herein, novel LaNi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ru intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi-d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ru has an overpotential of 43mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi-d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel membranes integrate the structural benefits of solid and liquid phases, culminating in the plasticization of cross&#8208;linked structure. This results in a decrease in the density of chain segment stacking and enhances the free volume within the separation membrane. Consequently, these gel membranes exhibit exceptional gas permeability, setting new records in performance.







Abstract
Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane's free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through the free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a 9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising the separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of nonfacilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.

         <title>Cesium Cyclopropane Acid&#8208;Aided Crystal Growth Enables Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Moisture Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) gives high crystallization quality in an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br prepared in a wide ambient moisture window (RH: 25&#8211;65&#8201;%). The resultant CsPbI2Br solar cells exhibit a high efficiency (&gt;17&#8201;%) and excellent environmental stability. The vaporization enthalpy of the side product DMA&#8208;acid (adjustable by C3 loads) modifies the perovskite crystallization and device performance under different humidity.







Abstract
While all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (iHPs) are promising photovoltaic materials, the associated water sensitivity of iHPs calls for stringent humidity control to reach satisfactory photovoltaic efficiencies. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208;insensitive perovskite formation route under ambient air for CsPbI2Br&#8208;based iHPs via cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) as a compound introducer. With this approach, appreciably enhanced crystallization quality and moisture tolerance of CsPbI2Br are attained. The improvements are attributed to the modified evaporation enthalpy of the volatile side product of DMA&#8208;acid initiated by Cs&#8208;acids. As such, the water&#8208;involving reaction is directed toward the DMA&#8208;acids, leaving the target CsPbI2Br perovskites insensitive to ambient humidity. We highlight that by controlling the C3 concentration, the dependence of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in CsPbI2Br devices on the humidity level during perovskite film formation becomes favorably weakened, with the PCEs remaining relatively high (&gt;15&#8201;%) associated with improved device stability for RH levels changed from 25&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%. The champion solar cells yield an impressive PCE exceeding 17&#8201;%, showing small degradations (&lt;10&#8201;%) for 2000&#8197;hours of shell storage and 300&#8197;hours of 85/85 (temperature/humidity) tests. The demonstrated C3&#8208;based strategy provides an enabler for improving the long&#8208;sought moisture&#8208;stability of iHPs toward high photovoltaic device performance.

         <title>Reconstitution of the Final Steps in the Biosynthesis of Valanimycin Reveals the Origin of Its Characteristic Azoxy Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis have been reconstituted in vitro. The oxidation of a dialkyl hydrazine intermediate to the characteristic azoxy moiety in valanimycin is catalyzed by VlmB, which is a non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme. The VlmB&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;electron oxidation may commence with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex without prior reduction.







Abstract
Valanimycin is an azoxy&#8208;containing natural product isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456&#8208;hF10. While the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been partially characterized, how the azoxy group is constructed remains obscure. Herein, the membrane protein VlmO and the putative hydrazine synthetase ForJ from the formycin biosynthetic pathway are demonstrated to catalyze N&#8722;N bond formation converting O&#8208;(l&#8208;seryl)&#8208;isobutyl hydroxylamine into N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;l&#8208;serine. Subsequent installation of the azoxy group is shown to be catalyzed by the non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme VlmB in a reaction in which the N&#8722;N single bond in the VlmO/ForJ product is oxidized by four electrons to yield the azoxy group. The catalytic cycle of VlmB appears to begin with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex in VlmB, as supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. This study also identifies N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;d&#8208;serine as an alternative substrate for VlmB leading to two azoxy regioisomers. The reactions catalyzed by the kinase VlmJ and the lyase VlmK during the final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis are established as well. The biosynthesis of valanimycin was thus fully reconstituted in vitro using the enzymes VlmO/ForJ, VlmB, VlmJ and VlmK. Importantly, the VlmB&#8208;catalyzed reaction represents the first example of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed azoxy formation and is expected to proceed by an atypical mechanism.

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state battery based on Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode, Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 solid electrolyte and GaN&#8208;modified Li anode. The assembled Li symmetric cell shows quite low interfacial resistance and great interfacial stability, and the full battery shows a high initial capacity, a high capacity retention, a high rate capability and a significantly mitigated voltage decay demonstrating a great potential in high energy density solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8722;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000&#8197;h at 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96&#8197;mV/cycle to only 0.66&#8197;mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (&#8776;170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully constructed a high-performance solid-state battery based on Li-rich Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, Li&lt;sub&gt;6.5&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; solid electrolyte and GaN-modified Li anode. The assembled Li symmetric cell shows quite low interfacial resistance and great interfacial stability, and the full battery shows a high initial capacity, a high capacity retention, a high rate capability and a significantly mitigated voltage decay demonstrating a great potential in high energy density solid-state battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries (SSBs) based on Li-rich Mn-based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three-dimensional foam-structured GaN&#8722;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high-performance SSB based on Co-free Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and Li&lt;sub&gt;6.5&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000&#8197;h at 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96&#8197;mV/cycle to only 0.66&#8197;mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (&#8776;170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte-based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte-based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high-performance LRMO-based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high-energy density SSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized acceptor has been synthesized to show extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low solubility, high glass transition temperature, and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels, leading to over 19% efficiency and highly stable ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits have enabled the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70&#8201;&#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600&#8197;hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.

         <title>Perovskite Oxide as A New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Sr and Ru perovskite oxide is constructed by modulating the Sr&#8208;site deficiency, thus exhibiting high Faradaic efficiency (38.6&#8201;%) and high NO3&#8722; yield rate (17.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in the electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR). The Ru active sites along with their adjacent oxygen vacancies in the perovskite oxide enhance the adsorption/activation of N2 molecules and decrease the thermodynamic barrier towards NOR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) offers an efficient and sustainable approach for conversion of widespread nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrate (NO3&#8722;) under mild conditions, representing a promising alternative to the traditional approach that involves harsh Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes. Unfortunately, due to the weak absorption/activation of N2 and the competitive oxygen evolution reaction, the kinetics of NOR process is extremely sluggish accompanied with low Faradaic efficiencies and NO3&#8722; yield rates. In this work, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched perovskite oxide with nonstoichiometric ratio of strontium and ruthenium (denoted as Sr0.9RuO3) was synthesized and explored as NOR electrocatalyst, which can exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency (38.6&#8201;%) with a high NO3&#8722; yield rate (17.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The experimental results show that the amount of oxygen vacancies in Sr0.9RuO3 is greatly higher than that of SrRuO3, following the same trend as their NOR performance. Theoretical simulations unravel that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 can render a decreased thermodynamic barrier toward the oxidation of *N2 to *N2OH at the rate&#8208;determining step, leading to its enhanced NOR performance.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Salt Template Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Fast Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, a facile and green recyclability room&#8208;temperature salt template antisolvent precipitation strategy is developed to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D pore carbon (N&#8208;3DPC). In situ Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses reveal that N&#8208;3DPC has highly reversible adsorption, fill, and intercalation reaction mechanisms, resulting in superior alkali metal&#8208;ion storage performance.







Abstract
The water&#8208;soluble salt&#8208;template technique holds great promise for fabricating 3D porous materials. However, an equipment&#8208;free and pore&#8208;size controllable synthetic approach employing salt&#8208;template precursors at room temperature has remained unexplored. Herein, we introduce a green room&#8208;temperature antisolvent precipitation strategy for creating salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors to universally produce 3D porous materials with controllable pore size. Through a combination of theoretical simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we unveil the antisolvent precipitation mechanism and provide guidelines for selecting raw materials and controlling the size of precipitated salt. Following the calcination and washing steps, we achieve large&#8208;scale and universal production of 3D porous materials and the recycling of the salt templates and antisolvents. The optimized nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon (N&#8208;3DPC) materials demonstrate distinctive structural benefits, facilitating a high capacity for potassium&#8208;ion storage along with exceptional reversibility. This is further supported by in situ electrochemical impedance spectra, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The anode shows a high rate capacity of 181&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the full cell. This study addresses the knowledge gap concerning the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of porous materials, thereby expanding their potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule imaging can elucidate the intricate biomolecular dynamics in vivo. We present a straightforward thiolation of squaraine that enhances its photobleaching lifetime by approximately fivefold at the single molecule level. This advancement allows for extended single&#8208;molecule tracking of the membrane protein CD56 in live cells, effectively tripling the duration of our observations.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a &#8776;5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.

         <title>Dendritic sp Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Polymers with Synergistic Multi&#8208;Active Groups for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Organic Batteries</title>

The C&#8801;C linked covalent benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic polymer with fluorine side groups is obtained for lithium organic batteries and exhibits superior electrochemical properties through the optimized molecule structure among alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups.







Abstract
Green organic materials composed of C, H, O, and N elements are receiving more and more attention worldwide. However, the high solubility, poor electrical conductivity, and long activation time limit the development of organic materials in practice. Herein, two stable covalent organic materials with alkynyl linkage between benzene rings and benzothiadiazole groups with different amounts of fluorine atoms modification (defined as BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F), are designed for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Both BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F can achieve superior reversible capacities of &#8776;719.8 and 713.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100&#8197;cycles on account of the redox activity of alkynyl (two&#8208;electron involved) and benzothiadiazole units (five&#8208;electron involved) in these organic materials. While BOP&#8208;2F electrodes exhibit much more stable cycling performance than BOP&#8208;0F electrodes, especially without pronounced capacity ascending during initial cycling. It can be assigned to the synergy effect of alkynyl linkage and fluorine atom modification in BOP&#8208;2F. The lithium storage and activation mechanism of alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups have also been deeply probed by a series of material characterizations and theoretical simulations. This work could be noteworthy in providing novel tactics for the molecular design and investigation of high&#8208;efficiency organic electrodes for energy storage.

         <title>Bent &#960;&#8208;Conjugation within a Macrocycle: Asymmetric Total Syntheses of Spirohexenolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of spirotetronate polyketides spirohexenolides A and B is reported. This synthesis features a ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the unprecedented deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation.







Abstract
Macrocycles with bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation motif are extremely rare in nature and synthetically daunting and anticancer haouamines and spirohexenolides were representative of such rare natural products with synthetically challenging bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation within a macrocycle. While the total synthesis of haouamines has been elegantly achieved, spirohexenolides remains an unmet synthetic challenge due to the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within C15 macrocycle. Inspired by the chemical synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and haouamines, herein we devise a synthetic strategy to overcome the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within the macrocycle and achieve the first, asymmetric total synthesis of spirohexenolides&#8197;A (&gt;20&#8197;mg) and&#8197;B (&gt;50&#8197;mg). Our synthesis features strategic design of ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation. In addition, we have developed a new enantioselective construction of highly functionalized spirotetronate fragment (northeast moiety) through RCM and Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement. Our in vitro bioassay studies reveal that both spirohexenolides are cytotoxic against a panel of human cancer cells with IC50 1.2&#8211;13.3&#8197;&#956;M and spirohexenolide A is consistently more potent (up to 3&#8197;times) than spirohexenolide B, suggesting the importance of alcohol for their bioactivity and for medicinal chemistry development.

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the relationship between confined space and product selectivity, a wrinkle structure was used as a model for confined spaces. The shape and dimension of the wrinkle can be systematically controlled at nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. The systematic control of the wrinkle model has revealed that the selectivities for CH4, C2H4, and EtOH are influenced differently by the shape and dimension of the confined space.







Abstract
The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH4, C2H4, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure. Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.

         <title>Engineering Electronic Structure of Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites by sp3&#8208;Hybridized Carbon and Incorporating Chlorine to Boost Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>

A heteroatom&#8208;doped metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a high oxygen reduction reaction activity in alkaline electrolyte. Liquid rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode has a good performance, and more importantly, the assembled flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable ZAB demonstrates a high power densities and charging/discharging stability at low, room, and high temperatures.







Abstract
Development of efficient and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare low&#8208;cost oxygen reaction electrocatalysts is essential for widespread application of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we mixed NaCl and ZIF&#8208;8 by simple physical milling and pyrolysis to obtain a metal&#8208;free porous electrocatalyst doped with Cl (mf&#8208;pClNC). The mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst exhibits a good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and high stability in alkaline electrolyte, exceeding most of the reported transition metal carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts and being comparable to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. Likewise, the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst also shows state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ORR activity and stability in acidic electrolyte. From experimental and theoretical calculations, the better ORR activity is most likely originated from the fact that the introduced Cl promotes the increase of sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon, while the sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon and Cl together modify the electronic structure of the N&#8208;adjacent carbons, as the active sites, while NaCl molten&#8208;salt etching provides abundant paths for the transport of electrons/protons. Furthermore, the liquid rechargeable ZAB using the mf&#8208;pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode shows a fulfilling performance with a peak power density of 276.88&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;A heteroatom-doped metal-free carbon-based electrocatalyst exhibits a high oxygen reduction reaction activity in alkaline electrolyte. Liquid rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) using the &lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode has a good performance, and more importantly, the assembled flexible quasi-solid-state rechargeable ZAB demonstrates a high power densities and charging/discharging stability at low, room, and high temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of efficient and easy-to-prepare low-cost oxygen reaction electrocatalysts is essential for widespread application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we mixed NaCl and ZIF-8 by simple physical milling and pyrolysis to obtain a metal-free porous electrocatalyst doped with Cl (&lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC). The &lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC electrocatalyst exhibits a good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and high stability in alkaline electrolyte, exceeding most of the reported transition metal carbon-based electrocatalysts and being comparable to commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. Likewise, the &lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC electrocatalyst also shows state-of-the-art ORR activity and stability in acidic electrolyte. From experimental and theoretical calculations, the better ORR activity is most likely originated from the fact that the introduced Cl promotes the increase of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon, while the &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized carbon and Cl together modify the electronic structure of the N-adjacent carbons, as the active sites, while NaCl molten-salt etching provides abundant paths for the transport of electrons/protons. Furthermore, the liquid rechargeable ZAB using the &lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode shows a fulfilling performance with a peak power density of 276.88&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Flexible quasi-solid-state rechargeable ZAB constructed with the &lt;i&gt;mf&lt;/i&gt;-pClNC electrocatalyst as the cathode exhibits an exciting performance both at low, high and room temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Free Exciton Emission in a Quasi&#8208;Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic connectivity of quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halide (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 is significantly elevated upon compression, leading to the generation and intensity enhancement of free exciton emission.







Abstract
Structural dimensionality and electronic dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the type of excitonic emission in hybrid metal halides (HMHs). It is important but challenging to achieve free exciton (FE) emission in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) HMHs based on the control over the electronic dimensionality. In this work, a quasi&#8208;0D HMH (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 with localized electronic dimensionality is prepared as a prototype model. With increasing pressure onto (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4, the broad and weak self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission at ambient conditions is considerably enhanced before 3.6&#8197;GPa, which originates from more distorted [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units upon compression. Notably, a narrow FE emission in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 appears at 3.6&#8197;GPa, and then this FE emission is gradually strengthened up to 8.4&#8197;GPa. High pressure structural characterizations reveal that anisotropic contraction of (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 results in a noticeable reduction in the distance between adjacent [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units, as well as an obvious enhancement of crystal stiffness. Consequently, the electronic connectivity in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 is sufficiently promoted above 3.6&#8197;GPa, which is also supported with theoretical calculations. The elevation of electronic connectivity and enhanced stiffness together lead to pressure&#8208;induced FE emission and subsequent emission enhancement in quasi&#8208;0D (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4.

         <title>High Gas Permeability in Aged Superglassy Membranes with Nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 Network Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel network filler, composed of nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) and carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) was prepared and was introduced into PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membranes (TFN). Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation and physical aging.







Abstract
Superglassy membranes synthesised by polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) suffer from physical aging and show poor gas permeance over time, especially thin membranes, due to the fast rearrangement of nonequilibrium polymer chains. Herein, we constructed a novel PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membrane (TFN) using nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 (&#8776;10&#8197;nm)/carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) as the composite filler. Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation, and thus physical aging. Nanosizing of UiO&#8208;66&#8722;NH2 was achieved by regulating the nucleation kinetics using carbon quantum dots (CQD) during the synthesis. This led to increased surface area, and hence more functional groups to bond with cPIM&#8208;1 (via hydrogen bonding between &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;COOH groups), which also improved interfacial compatibility between the 3D network and polymer chains avoiding defect formation. As a result, the novel TFN showed significantly improved performance in gas separation along with reduced aging (i.e. &#8776;6&#8201;% loss in CO2 permeability over 63&#8197;days); the aged membranes had a CO2 permeance of 2504 GPU and ideal selectivity values of 37.2 and 23.8 for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4, respectively.

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and High&#8208;Toughness Hydrogels Regulated by Porous Cationic Polymers: the Effect of Counteranions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;hysteresis and high&#8208;toughness hydrogels were developed through controllable interactions of porous cationic polymers (PCPs) with adjustable counteranions. This strategy reduces chain segment slippage under load, endowing the PCP&#8208;based hydrogels (PCP&#8208;gels) with good elasticity under large deformations (7&#8201;% hysteresis at a strain ratio of 40).







Abstract
Service life and range of polymer materials is heavily reliant on their elasticity and mechanical stability under long&#8208;term loading. Slippage of chain segments under load leads to significant hysteresis of the hydrogels, limiting its repeatability and mechanical stability. Achieving the desired elasticity exceeding that of rubber is a great challenge for hydrogels, particularly when subjected to large deformations. Here, low&#8208;hysteresis and high&#8208;toughness hydrogels were developed through controllable interactions of porous cationic polymers (PCPs) with adjustable counteranions, including reversible bonding of PCP frameworks/polymer segments (polyacrylamide, PAAm) and counteranions/PAAm. This strategy reduces chain segment slippage under load, endowing the PCP&#8208;based hydrogels (PCP&#8208;gels) with good elasticity under large deformations (7&#8201;% hysteresis at a strain ratio of 40). Furthermore, due to the enlarged chain segments entanglement by PCP, the PCP&#8208;gels exhibit large strain (13000&#8201;%), significantly enhanced toughness (68 MJ m&#8722;3), high fracture energy (43.1&#8197;kJ m&#8722;2), and fatigue resistance. The unique properties of these elastic PCP&#8208;gels have promising applications in the field of flexible sensors.

Cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au) for N2 photofixation. Benefitting from judicious structural and defect engineering, the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au exhibit great nitrogen photofixation performance with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using solar illumination under ambient conditions is a promising strategy for production of the indispensable chemical NH3. However, due to the catalyst&#8216;s limitations in solar energy utilization, loss of hot electrons during transfer, and low nitrogen adsorption and activation capacity, the unsatisfactory solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiencies of most photocatalysts limit their practical applications. Herein, cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (denoted cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au). Plasmonic Au extended the absorption of light from the visible to the second near&#8208;infrared region. The superior interface greatly enhanced the transfer efficiency of hot electrons. Abundant strain&#8208;VO defects induced by interfacial compressive strain promoted adsorption and in situ activation of nitrogen, and such synergistic promotion of strain and VO defects was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The judicious structural and defect engineering co&#8208;promoted the efficient nitrogen photofixation of the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au heterostructures with a SCC efficiency of 0.1&#8201;% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which is comparable to the average solar&#8208;to&#8208;biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants, thus exhibiting significant potential as a new candidate for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Exploring Superacid&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Reorganization of Aliphatic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement of isopropyl&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds allows the skeletal reorganization to cyclic and elongated functionalized systems. An unprecedented tandem C&#8722;N bond cleavage / C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation through the generation of a dication is shown.







Abstract
Here we report a method to reorganize the core structure of aliphatic unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates exploiting polyprotonation in superacid solutions. The superelectrophilic activation of N&#8208;isopropyl systems allows for the selective formal Csp3&#8722;H activation/cyclization or homologation / functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates. This study also reveals that this skeletal reorganization can be controlled through protonation interplay. The mechanism of this process involves an original sequence of C&#8722;N bond cleavage, isopropyl cation generation and subsequent C&#8722;N bond and C&#8722;C bond formation. This was demonstrated through in situ NMR analysis and labelling experiments, also confirmed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Carbon Oxyanion Self&#8208;Transformation on NiFe Oxalates Enables Long&#8208;Term Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon transformation (from C2O42&#8722; to CO32&#8722;) not only facilitates the generation of active sites but also defends the key active oxyhydroxides against surface chlorine chemistry during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline seawater. Moreover, NiFe oxalates on Ni foam ((NiFe)C2O4/NF) outperforms reported catalysts by achieving 600&#8208;h operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with minimal potential losses.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H2 in coastal areas, and NiFe&#8208;based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&#8722; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in situ carbon oxyanion self&#8208;transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high&#8208;valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In situ/ex situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during ASO even at an ampere&#8208;level current density (j). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349&#8197;mV to attain a j of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO32&#8722; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600&#8197;h of electrolysis under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self&#8208;transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion systems.

         <title>Enabling Carbonized Polymer Dots with Color&#8208;tunable Time&#8208;dependent Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Confining Carboxyl Dimer Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through confining carboxyl dimer association into carbonized polymer dots, its red room temperature phosphorescence was observed, which provides a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit. By hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl groups and promoting the formation of carboxyl dimer association, we realized the fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color from yellow to green to orange to green.







Abstract
Developing a facile strategy to realize fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color in time&#8208;dependent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is essential but both theoretically and practically rarely exploited. Through simultaneously confining carboxyl dimer association and isolated carboxyl into the particle via a simple hydrothermal treatment of polyacrylic acid, a dual&#8208;peak emission of red phosphorescence (645&#8197;nm) and green phosphorescence (550&#8197;nm) was observed from carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The ratio of the two luminescent species can be well regulated by hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl to promote hydrogen bond. Due to comparable but different lifetimes, color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP with color changing from yellow to green or orange to green were obtained. Based on the crosslinking enhanced emission effect, the phosphorescence visible time was even extended to 7&#8197;s through introducing polyethylenimide. This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP, but also provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.

         <title>Anchoring of Metal Complexes on Au25 Nanocluster for Enhanced Photocoupled Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring of metal complexes on an atomically precise Au25 nanocluster (NC) via a ligand exchange reaction provides an efficient electron&#8208;transfer pathway to improve the CO2 reduction activity and selectivity to CO in a wide potential range. Upon illumination, the current density could further be enhanced, and the hybrid system improves the stability of Au NCs by removing the excitation from the Au NCs under light.







Abstract
Atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) with discrete energy levels can be used as photosensitizers for CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Anchoring of metal complexes on an atomically precise Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; nanocluster (NC) via a ligand exchange reaction provides an efficient electron-transfer pathway to improve the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity and selectivity to CO in a wide potential range. Upon illumination, the current density could further be enhanced, and the hybrid system improves the stability of Au NCs by removing the excitation from the Au NCs under light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) with discrete energy levels can be used as photosensitizers for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. However, tight ligand capping of Au NCs hinders CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption on its active sites. Here, a new hybrid material is obtained by anchoring of thiol functionalized terpyridine metal complexes (metal=Ru, Ni, Fe, Co) on Au NCs by ligand exchange reactions (LERs). The anchoring of Ru and Ni complexes on Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; NC (Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru and Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ni) leads to adequate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO conversion for photocoupled electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (PECR) in terms of high selectivity, with Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) exceeding 90&#8201;% in a wide potential range, remarkable activity (CO production rate up to two times higher than that for pristine Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;PET&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;) and extremely large turnover frequencies (TOFs, 63012&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.97&#8197;V for Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru and 69989&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE for Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ni).

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally activated twisted&#8208;folded (T&#8208;F) form of bisquinodimethane with a dithiin skeleton (SS&#8208;BQD) undergoes a facile apparent 2e&#8208;transfer (trigger). Furthermore, in the resulting dication, the steric repulsion and interelectrophore interaction cause a facile and rapid change in the structure from the as&#8208;generated T2+&#8208;F form to the T2+&#8208;T form (domino), which facilitates the subsequent oxidation to the tetracation (domino).







Abstract
The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher HOMO level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.

         <title>Revealing the CO2 Conversion at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Nanoscale Visualization Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we explored the electrode/electrolyte interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The results indicate that the laser alters the reaction pathways of the CO2 reduction processes, which changes the morphological evolution of the discharge products at the interfaces, and in turn, affects the cell performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) battery technology presents a promising opportunity for carbon capture and energy storage. Despite tremendous efforts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the complex electrode/electrolyte/CO2 triple&#8208;phase interfacial processes remain poorly understood, in particular at the nanoscale. Here, using in situ atomic force microscopy and laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy, we directly observed the CO2 conversion processes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries at the nanoscale, and further revealed a laser&#8208;tuned reaction pathway based on the real&#8208;time observations. During discharge, a bi&#8208;component composite, Li2CO3/C, deposits as micron&#8208;sized clusters through a 3D progressive growth model, followed by a 3D decomposition pathway during the subsequent recharge. When the cell operates under laser (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) irradiation, densely packed Li2CO3/C flakes deposit rapidly during discharge. Upon the recharge, they predominantly decompose at the interfaces of the flake and electrode, detaching themselves from the electrode and causing irreversible capacity degradation. In situ Raman shows that the laser promotes the formation of poorly soluble intermediates, Li2C2O4, which in turn affects growth/decomposition pathways of Li2CO3/C and the cell performance. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and the laser&#8208;tuned CO2 conversion reactions, which can inspire strategies of monitoring and controlling the multistep and multiphase interfacial reactions in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Umpolung Isomerization in Radical Copolymerization of Benzyl Vinyl Ether with Pentafluorophenylacrylate Leading to Degradable AAB Periodic Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical copolymerzation of benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE; A) with the highly electron&#8208;deficient acrylate monomer pentafluorophenylacrylate (PFA; B) progressed with unique backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE unit. The isomerization caused the umpolung of the growing species, leading to a periodic consumption in the order AAB, and consequently the copolymer resulting after post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) was degradable under acidic conditions.







Abstract
This study revealed that benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows a peculiar isomerization propagation in its radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying a pentafluorophenyl group (PFA). The co&#8208;monomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in the electron density. However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving a benzyl radical species prior to propagation with BnVE. The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of the growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA. Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11=0.174 and r21=6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups by post&#8208;polymerization alcoholysis and aminolysis modifications. The unique isomerization in the AAB sequence allowed the periodic introduction of a benzyl ether structure in the backbone leading to efficient degradation under acid conditions.

A simple substrate design allows site&#8208;specific activation of cyclic ketones for olefination reaction of aromatic carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Skeletal editing is an important strategy in organic synthesis as it modifies the carbon backbone to tailor molecular structures with precision, enabling access to compounds with specific desired properties. Skeletal editing empowers chemists to transform synthetic approaches of target compounds across diverse applications from drug discovery to materials science. Herein, we introduce a new skeletal editing method to convert readily available aromatic carbonyl compounds into valuable unsaturated carboxylic acids with extended carbon chains. Our reaction setup enables a cascade reaction of enolization&#8208;[2+2]cycloaddition&#8208;[2+2]cycloreversion between aromatic carbonyl compounds and ketals of cyclic ketones to generate unsaturated carboxylic acids as ring&#8208;opening products. Through a simple design, our substrates are specifically activated to react at predetermined positions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. This practical method offers convenient access to versatile organic building blocks as well as provides fresh insights into manipulating traditional reaction pathways for new synthetic applications.

     alt="Olefination of Aromatic Carbonyls via Site-Specific Activation of Cycloalkanone Ketals**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple substrate design allows site-specific activation of cyclic ketones for olefination reaction of aromatic carbonyl compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeletal editing is an important strategy in organic synthesis as it modifies the carbon backbone to tailor molecular structures with precision, enabling access to compounds with specific desired properties. Skeletal editing empowers chemists to transform synthetic approaches of target compounds across diverse applications from drug discovery to materials science. Herein, we introduce a new skeletal editing method to convert readily available aromatic carbonyl compounds into valuable unsaturated carboxylic acids with extended carbon chains. Our reaction setup enables a cascade reaction of enolization-[2+2]cycloaddition-[2+2]cycloreversion between aromatic carbonyl compounds and ketals of cyclic ketones to generate unsaturated carboxylic acids as ring-opening products. Through a simple design, our substrates are specifically activated to react at predetermined positions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. This practical method offers convenient access to versatile organic building blocks as well as provides fresh insights into manipulating traditional reaction pathways for new synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Skeletons of Covalent Organic Framework for High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeleton engineering was used to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diarylamine derivatives and ionized skeletons, thus overcoming the weak binding ability of Au ions, giving gold adsorbents with high selectivity and uptakes. Experiments and theoretical calculations show that the transition of binding sites from C=N bonds to ionic amine sites, thereby avoiding the protonation process, contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine&#8208;linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90&#8201;% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63&#8197;times of that from the charge&#8208;neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, exceptional selectivity (97.45&#8201;%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl4&#8722; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Polymerization Landscape by Lipid Mesophase Soft Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic synthesis of dextran in lipidic mesophase catalyzed by the enzyme dextransucrase DSR&#8208;M not only yields polymers at 30&#8201;&#176;C that are six times longer than in bulk solution at identical concentrations of reactants, but also allows the reaction to be carried out in subzero liquid water at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Soft nanoconfinement can increase chemical reactivity in nature and has therefore led to considerable interest in transferring this universal feature to artificial biological systems. However, little is known about the underlying principles of soft nanoconfinement responsible for the enhancement of biochemical reactions. Herein we demonstrate how enzymatic polymerization can be expanded, optimized, and engineered when carried out under soft nanoconfinement mediated by lipidic mesophases. By systematically varying the water content in the mesophase and thus the diameter of the confined water nanochannels, we show higher efficiency, turnover rate, and degrees of polymerization as compared to the bulk aqueous solution, all controlled by soft nanoconfinement effects. Furthermore, we exploit the unique properties of unfreezing soft nanoconfined water to perform the first enzymatic polymerization at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in pure aqueous media. These results underpin lipidic mesophases as a versatile host system for chemical reactions and promote them as an original and unexplored platform for enzymatic polymerization.

The successful creation of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; protein nanocrystals, which demonstrate ultra&#8208;rapid crystalline cross&#8208;linking behavior at pH levels above 7.6, underpins the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. As reported by Peng Yang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310879), this pH&#8208;triggered cross&#8208;linking can be feasibly accomplished under conditions that resemble physiological environments, highlighting its significant potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Spin Frustration in Organic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin frustration has drawn people's attention for its significance in physics and materials science, especially for quantum spin liquids. Organic radical species show a promising potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated compounds. This Minireview briefly introduces the reported examples of organic radicals that possess spin frustration and summarizes their related data on frustration properties.







Abstract
Spin frustration, which results from geometric frustration and a systematical inability to satisfy all antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between unpaired spins simultaneously, is under the spotlight for its importance in physics and materials science. Spin frustration is treated as the structural basis of quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Featuring flexible chemical structures, organic radical species exhibit great potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated molecules and lattices. So far, the reported examples of spin&#8208;frustrated organic radical compounds include triradicals, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) radicals and derivatives, [Pd(dmit)2] compounds (dmit=1,3&#8208;dithiol&#8208;2&#8208;thione&#8208;4,5&#8208;dithiolate), nitronyl nitroxides, fullerenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other heterocyclic compounds where the spin frustration is generated intra&#8208; or intermolecularly. In this Minireview, we provide a brief summary of the reported radical compounds that possess spin frustration. The related data, including magnetic exchange coupling parameters, spin models, frustration parameters, and crystal lattices, are summarized and discussed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the impact of thermal treatments on the optimization of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for electrochemical applications. It focuses on atomic&#8208;level structural changes induced by heat and assesses their influence on electrocatalysis. The article also offers tailored approaches to guide researchers in selecting effective techniques and thermal settings, thereby advancing electrochemical research.







Abstract
In the evolving field of electrocatalysis, thermal treatment of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts has become an essential strategy for performance enhancement. This review systematically investigates the impact of various thermal treatments on the catalytic potential of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts. The focus encompasses an in&#8208;depth analysis of the changes induced in structural, morphological, and compositional properties, as well as alterations in electro&#8208;active surface area, surface chemistry, and crystal defects. By providing a comprehensive comparison of commonly used thermal techniques, such as annealing, calcination, sintering, pyrolysis, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods, this review serves as a scientific guide for selecting the right thermal technique and favorable temperature to tailor the nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for optimal electrocatalysis. The resultant modifications in catalytic activity are explored across key electrochemical reactions such as electrochemical (bio)sensing, catalytic degradation, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, fuel cells, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Through a detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects, this review contributes to a fundamental understanding of the role of thermal treatments in enhancing electrocatalytic properties. The insights provided offer a roadmap for future research aimed at optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of nanomaterials, fostering the development of next&#8208;generation sensors and energy conversion technologies.

         <title>From Biomimicking to Bioinspired Design of Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to C1 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired chemical engineering (NICE) approach for the design of nature&#8208;inspired electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to C1 products is presented in this Minireview.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising approach to maintain a carbon cycle balance and produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, CO2RR technology is far from mature, since the conventional CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from low activity (leading to currents &lt;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell), stability (&lt;120&#8197;h), and selectivity. Hence, they cannot meet the requirements for commercial applications (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &gt;8000&#8197;h, &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity). Significant improvements are possible by taking inspiration from nature, considering biological organisms that efficiently catalyze the CO2 to various products. In this minireview, we present recent examples of enzyme&#8208;inspired and enzyme&#8208;mimicking CO2RR electrocatalysts enabling the production of C1 products with high faradaic efficiency (FE). At present, these designs do not typically follow a methodical approach, but rather focus on isolated features of biological systems. To achieve disruptive change, we advocate a systematic design methodology that leverages fundamental mechanisms associated with desired properties in nature and adapts them to the context of engineering applications.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Studies of Soluble Inorganic Nanostructures with X&#8208;rays and Neutrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption as well as neutron scattering can extract structural information describing assembly and supramolecular assembly of soluble inorganic nanostructures (SoINs). Here we review the use of X&#8208;rays and neutrons for SoIN characterization, covering basic principles, practices, data analysis, and recent relevant studies that probe the solution state of materials/inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
This Review addresses the use of X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering as well as X&#8208;ray absorption to describe how inorganic nanostructured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop). We review recent studies of soluble inorganic nanostructure assembly, covering the disciplines of materials synthesis, processes in nature, nuclear materials, and the widely applicable fundamental processes of hydrophobic interactions and ion pairing. Reviewed studies cover size regimes and length scales ranging from sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m (coordination chemistry and ion pairing) to several nanometers (molecular clusters, i.e. polyoxometalates, polyoxocations, and metal&#8208;organic polyhedra), to the mesoscale (supramolecular assembly processes). Reviewed studies predominantly exploit 1)&#8197;SAXS/WAXS/SANS (small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray or neutron scattering), 2)&#8197;PDF (pair&#8208;distribution function analysis of X&#8208;ray total scattering), and 3)&#8197;XANES and EXAFS (X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, respectively). While the scattering techniques provide structural information, X&#8208;ray absorption yields the oxidation state in addition to the local coordination. Our goal for this Review is to provide information and inspiration for the inorganic/materials science communities that may benefit from elucidating the role of solution speciation in natural and synthetic processes.

         <title>Tipping the Balance Between the bcc and fcc Phase Within the Alkali and Coinage Metal Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relativistic density functional calculations for the cuboidal phase transition show that small effects such as dispersion interactions and phonon contributions can tip the balance between the body&#8208;centered and face&#8208;centered cubic structures shedding light into the difference between the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
Why the Group&#8197;1 elements crystallize in the body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure, and the iso&#8208;electronic Group&#8197;11 elements in the face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure, remains a mystery. Here we show that a delicate interplay between many&#8208;body effects, vibrational contributions and dispersion interactions obtained from relativistic density functional theory offers an answer to this long&#8208;standing controversy. It also sheds light on the Periodic Table of Crystal Structures. A smooth diffusionless transition through cuboidal lattices gives a detailed insight into the bcc&#8594;fcc phase transition for the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Protein Conformation Transistor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful acquisition of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structural protein nanocrystals that undergo ultrafast cross&#8208;linking behavior in response to pH levels above 7.6 illustrate the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. This pH&#8208;responsive cross&#8208;linking can be conveniently achieved under near physiological conditions, highlighting the great potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.







Abstract
Analogous to electronic transistors, transistor&#8208;like responsive materials undergo sharp structural transitions in response to a very narrow range of microenvironment signals. This kind of material is typically limited to synthetic polymer&#8208;derived nanoscale assembly or disassembly and has profound implications for modern high&#8208;tech applications. Herein, we evolve this system from synthetic polymers to biopolymers and extend the corresponding assembly scale from the nanoscale to meso/macro&#8208;scale. We develop unique protein nanocrystals with core&#8211;shell structures through a two&#8208;step nucleation process. The protein nanocrystals exhibit exceptional transistor&#8208;like pH&#8208;responsive mesoscale assembly through the formation of inter&#8208;particle &#946;&#8208;sheet linkers. This allows ultrasensitive cross&#8208;linking behavior, such as self&#8208;coacervation at a water/water interface, ultrafast gelation in seconds, and ultrasensitive swelling for detection of basic vapors at extremely low concentrations. This breakthrough has great promise for broader applications such as drug encapsulation and delivery, biosensing, cytomimetic materials, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Enzymatic Fluoromethylation as a Tool for ATP&#8208;Independent Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report shows that methyltransferase&#8208;mediated fluoromethylation can activate small and large carboxylate substrates for conjugation to thiols, hydrazine, hydroxylamine or amines. This methodology to produce anhydrides offers an alternative to the much more common ATP&#8208;dependent processes observed in nature and utilized in biocatalysis.







Abstract
S&#8208;adenosylmethionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are involved in countless biological processes, including signal transduction, epigenetics, natural product biosynthesis, and detoxification. Only a handful of carboxylate methyltransferases have evolved to participate in amide bond formation. In this report we show that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed F&#8208;methylation of carboxylate substrates produces F&#8208;methyl esters that readily react with N&#8208; or S&#8208;nucleophiles under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the synthesis of small amides, hydroxamates, and thioesters, as well as to site&#8208;specific protein modification and native chemical ligation.

&lt;p&gt;This report shows that methyltransferase-mediated fluoromethylation can activate small and large carboxylate substrates for conjugation to thiols, hydrazine, hydroxylamine or amines. This methodology to produce anhydrides offers an alternative to the much more common ATP-dependent processes observed in nature and utilized in biocatalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alicyclic&#8208;Amine&#8208;Derived Imine&#8208;BF3 Complexes: Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Make Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Valuable &#945;&#8208;Functionalized Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;BF3 complexes derived from alicyclic amines represent novel building blocks that are readily prepared in a single synthetic operation. These complexes engage with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles, typically under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions. The in situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines.







Abstract
A new strategy to access &#945;&#8208;functionalized alicyclic amines via their corresponding imine&#8208;BF3 complexes is reported. Isolable imine&#8208;BF3 complexes, readily prepared via dehydrohalogenation of N&#8208;bromoamines in a base&#8208;promoted/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 catalyzed process followed by addition of boron trifluoride etherate, undergo reactions with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles. Organozinc and organomagnesium nucleophiles add at ambient temperatures, obviating the need for cryogenic conditions. In situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines in a single operation. &#945;&#8208;Functionalized morpholines can be elaborated further, for instance by installing a second substituent in the &#945;&#8242;&#8208;position.

         <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism Elucidates Molecular Interactions in Aggregated Chiral Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic circular dichroism gives access to the geometry and interactions leading to the supramolecular structure of a thin film of an organic chiral molecule. The technique presented here may be applied to elucidate the structures of aggregates of organic compounds.







Abstract
Chiral materials formed by aggregated organic compounds play a fundamental role in chiral optoelectronics, photonics and spintronics. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the molecular interactions involved remains an open problem. Here we introduce magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) as a new tool to elucidate molecular interactions and structural parameters of a supramolecular system. A detailed analysis of MCD together with electronic circular dichroism spectra combined to ab initio calculations unveils essential information on the geometry and energy levels of a self&#8208;assembled thin film made of a carbazole di&#8208;bithiophene chiral molecule. This approach can be extended to a generality of chiral organic materials and can help rationalizing the fundamental interactions leading to supramolecular order. This in turn could enable a better understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships, resulting in a more efficient material design.

         <title>Acquiring Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Featured Single&#8208;Molecule Ultralong Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy for high energy level and long&#8208;lived triplet charge transfer (3CT)&#8208;featured single&#8208;molecule phosphorescence materials was proposed. Through this strategy, a robust phosphor, NIC&#8208;DMAC, was constructed with a long lifetime (&#964;3CT) exceeding 210&#8197;ms and a 3CT energy level (E3CT) as high as 2.50&#8197;eV. Thanks to its long&#8208;lived 3CT state and high E3CT, NIC&#8208;DMAC was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and achieved double patterning.







Abstract
Although long&#8208;lived triplet charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) state with high energy level has gained significant attention, the development of organic small molecules capable of achieving such states remains a major challenge. Herein, by using the through&#8208;space electronic coupling effect, we have developed a compound, namely NIC&#8208;DMAC, which has a long&#8208;lived 3CT state at the single&#8208;molecule level with a lifetime of 210&#8197;ms and a high energy level of up to 2.50&#8197;eV. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we have elucidated the photophysical processes of NIC&#8208;DMAC, which involve sequential transitions from the first singlet excited state (S1) that shows a 1CT character to the first triplet excited state (T1) that exhibits a local excited state feature (3LE), and then to the second triplet excited state (T2) that shows a 3CT character (i.e., S1 (1CT)&#8594;T1 (3LE)&#8594;T2 (3CT)). The long lifetime and high energy level of its 3CT state have enabled NIC&#8208;DMAC as an initiator for photocuring in double patterning applications.

A mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free protocol for Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;Nucleophiles using nontoxic, solid allyl trimethylammonium chloride as alternative allylating agent is presented. This method features fast reaction kinetics, very low catalyst loadings, high yields, mild conditions, and high functional group tolerance. Its potential for late&#8208;stage modifications of bioactive compounds is demonstrated through multiple examples.







Abstract
We present the first solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical protocol for a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation. This approach features exceptionally low catalyst loadings (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (&lt;90&#8197;min), and a simple setup, eliminating the need for air or moisture precautions, making the process highly efficient and environmentally benign. We introduce solid, nontoxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle allyl trimethylammonium salts as valuable alternative to volatile or hazardous reagents. Our approach enables the allylation of various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles in yields up to 99&#8201;% even for structurally complex bioactive compounds, owing to its mild conditions and exceptional functional group tolerance.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrizative Coupling of 7&#8208;Azabenzonorbornadienes with Alkynylanilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of prochiral 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with readily available alkynylanilines afforded dihydronaphthalenes via concomitant generation of three covalent bonds. The methods also allows to build two stereocenters and an indole motif in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective as well as atom&#8208;economic manner.







Abstract
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed, domino enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with alkynylanilines is disclosed herein. This operationally simple transformation generates three covalent bonds and two contiguous stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity. The resulting functionalized indole&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;amine conjugates served as an appealing platform to streamline the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. DFT calculations revealed that the two stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions contributed to the observed enantioselectivity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Discorhabdin V
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V was accomplished through a highly convergent strategy enabled by scalable access to the two key components. This highly selective asymmetric approach to nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdins lays the foundation for access to this class of natural products.







Abstract
The discorhabdin natural products are a large subset of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids with a myriad of biological activities. Despite garnering much synthetic attention, few members have thus far been completed, particularly those featuring a bridging carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond that is found in numerous discorhabdins, including discorhabdin V. Herein we report the first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V. To access the pyrroloiminoquinone we developed a convergent N&#8208;alkylation/oxidative aminocyclization/bromination cascade that joins two key components, which are both made on multigram scale. An intramolecular Heck reaction then forms the quaternary carbon center in an intermediate containing the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bridge, and a reductive N,O&#8208;acetal cyclization sequence introduces the final piperidine ring. Furthermore, we have established the relative configuration of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V through experimental NOESY data and DP4 NMR probability calculations. The absolute configuration of the natural product has also been determined by circular dichroism and the use of an amino acid derived chiral starting material. Our work represents one of only two reports of a total synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdin and paves the way for future biological evaluation of such compounds.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation of Ketones with 2&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric allylation of ketones under proton&#8208;transfer conditions is a challenging issue due to the limited pronucleophiles and the electrophilic inertness of ketones. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines work as synthetic equivalents of propanals. Upon the acidic workup, a formal asymmetric &#946;&#8208;addition of propanals to ketones is achieved. An investigation on KIE effect indicates that the deprotonation of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines is the rate&#8208;determining step, which generates nucleophilic allyl copper(I) species. Finally, the synthetic utility of the present method is demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;boivinianin A and (R)&#8208;gossonorol.

         <title>Tuning the Aggregates of Thiophene&#8208;based Trimers by Methyl Side&#8208;chain Engineering for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT)&#8208;based conjugated trimers and their photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by methyl side&#8208;chain engineering. TBT&#8208;3 with the smallest size of aggregates and highest crystallinity exhibit the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, which is due to the shorter charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors (OCSs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic materials for photocatalysis. However, the aggregation of OCSs in photocatalytic aqueous solution caused by self&#8208;assembly, which closely relates to the photocatalytic activity, has not yet been studied. Here, the relationship between the aggregation of 4,7&#8208;Bis(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzothiadiazole (TBT) and the photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated by introducing and varying the position of methyl side chains on the two peripheral thiophene units. Experimental and theoretical results indicated that the introduction of &#8208;CH3 group at the 3&#8208;position of TBT resulted in the smallest size and best crystallinity of aggregates compared to that of TBT, 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions. As a result, TBT&#8208;3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution, ascribed to the shorten charge carrier transport distance and solid long&#8208;range order. These results suggest the important role of aggregation behavior of OCSs for efficient photocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an [M8L24]16+ Intertwined Cube and a Giant [M12L16]24+ Orthobicupola</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been used to create a giant orthobicupola and an intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type cube&#8221;. The concept of generating intricate structures through the use of flexibility in the form of an elongated, flexible terphenyl&#8208;based tetratopic ligand (L2) in combination with a cis&#8208;blocked Pd(II) metal counterpart led to the formation of this uncommon water&#8208;soluble intertwined &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; cube.







Abstract
Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1). When flexibility is introduced into the ligand by the incorporation of a &#8208;CH2&#8208; group between the dipyridylamine and terphenyl rings in the ligand (L2), anunique [M8L24]16+ water&#8208;soluble &#8216;intertwined cubic structure&#8217; (2) results. The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and &#8242;intertwined cubic structure&#8242; in this scenario. This research showcases the ability to design and fabricate novel, topologically distinctive molecular structures by a straightforward and efficient approach.

     alt="Self-Assembly of an [M8L24]16+ Intertwined Cube and a Giant [M12L16]24+ Orthobicupola"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordination-driven self-assembly has been used to create a giant orthobicupola and an intertwined &#8220;A-type cube&#8221;. The concept of generating intricate structures through the use of flexibility in the form of an elongated, flexible terphenyl-based tetratopic ligand (&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;) in combination with a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-blocked Pd(II) metal counterpart led to the formation of this uncommon water-soluble intertwined &#8220;A-type&#8221; cube.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through coordination-driven self-assembly, aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self-assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl-based tetra-pyridyl ligand (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;) with a cis-Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;24+&lt;/sup&gt; triangular orthobicupola structure (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). When flexibility is introduced into the ligand by the incorporation of a -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- group between the dipyridylamine and terphenyl rings in the ligand (&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;), anunique [M&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;16+&lt;/sup&gt; water-soluble &#8216;intertwined cubic structure&#8217; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) results. The inherent flexibility of ligand &lt;b&gt;L2&lt;/b&gt; might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and &#8242;intertwined cubic structure&#8242; in this scenario. This research showcases the ability to design and fabricate novel, topologically distinctive molecular structures by a straightforward and efficient approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single disease biomarker, a two&#8208;photon fluorescence probe which is turned on sequentially by &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and HBrO was designed to predict early atherosclerotic plaques. The voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed at the cellular level, demonstrating that both GGT and HBrO can be applied as biomarkers of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse atherosclerosis or existing plaques. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which is accompanied by an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzes the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.

         <title>Methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation Enables the Stereoselective Synthesis and Structure Revision of Indidene Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indane polyketides indidenes A and C were synthesized from a common intermediate through nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, respectively. The common diol intermediate was obtained by palladium&#8208;catalyzed methylene C&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective modes. This study led to the revision of the absolute configuration of indidene C.







Abstract
The divergent synthesis of two indane polyketides of the indidene family, namely (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A (11 steps, 1.7&#8201;%) and (+)&#8208;indidene C (13 steps, 1.3&#8201;%), is reported. The synthesis of the trans&#8208;configured common indane intermediate was enabled by palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation, which was performed in both racemic and enantioselective (e.r. 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) modes. Further elaboration of this common intermediate by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling allowed the rapid installation of the aroyl moiety of (&#177;)&#8208;indidene A. In parallel, the biphenyl system of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;indidene C was constructed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. These investigations led us to revise the structures of indidenes B and C.

Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor provides fluorolactones via a sequence of 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation, Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination.







Abstract
We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8722;C, one C&#8722;O and one tertiary C&#8722;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.

         <title>Realizing Low&#8208;Temperature Graphite&#8208;based Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite (Gr) has been considered as the most promising anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) commercialization due to its high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, Gr&#8208;based PIBs remain unfeasible at low temperature (LT), suffering from either poor kinetics based on conventional carbonate electrolytes or K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation issue based on typical ether electrolytes. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Gr&#8208;based LT rechargeable PIB is realized for the first time by electrolyte chemistry. Applying unidentate&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecule as the solvent dramatically weakens the K+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowers corresponding K+ de&#8208;solvation kinetic barrier. Meanwhile, introduction of steric hindrance suppresses co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent into Gr, greatly elevating operating voltage and cyclability of the full battery. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Gr||prepotassiated 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylicacid&#8208;dianhydride (KPTCDA) full PIB can reversibly charge/discharge between &#8208;30 and 45 &#176;C with a considerable energy density up to 197 Wh kgcathode&#8208;1 at &#8208;20 &#176;C, hopefully facilitating the development of LT PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic in&#8208;situ Formation of Cu2O Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters through Photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling&#8217;s Reaction for Selective and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) is evidenced to be effective for constructing advanced catalysts. In particular, Cu2O is identified to be active for general catalytic reactions. However, conflicting results regarding the true structure&#8208;activity correlations between Cu2O&#8208;based active sites and efficiencies are usually reported. The structure of Cu2O undergoes dynamic evolution rather than remaining stable under working conditions, in which the actual reaction cannot proceed over the prefabricated Cu2O sites. Therefore, the dynamic construction of Cu2O active sites can be developed to promote catalytic efficiency and reveal the true structure&#8208;activity correlations. Herein, by introducing the redox pairs of Cu2+ and reducing sugar into a photocatalysis system, it is clarified that the Cu2O sub&#8208;nanoclusters (NCs), working as novel active sites, are on&#8208;site constructed on the substrate via a photoinduced pseudo&#8208;Fehling&#8217;s route. The realistic interfacial charge separation and transformation capacities are remarkably promoted by the dynamic Cu2O NCs under the actual catalysis condition, which achieves a milestone efficiency for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photosynthesis, including the targets of production rate (1.98&#177;0.04 mol gCu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), conversion ratio (94.2%&#177;0.91%), and selectivity (98.6%&#177;0.55%). The current work develops an effective strategy for integrating the active site construction into realistic reactions, providing new opportunities for Cu&#8208;based chemistry and catalysis sciences research.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Cyano&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks from Water, Air and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insufficient exciton (e&#8208;&#8208;h+ pair) separation/transfer and sluggish two&#8208;electron water oxidation are two main factors limiting the H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts.  Herein, we present an alternative strategy to simultaneously facilitate exciton separation/transfer and reduce the energy barrier of two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COFs via a dicyano functionalization. The in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the dicyano functionalization improves the amount of charge transfer channels between donor and acceptor units from two in COF&#8208;0CN without cyano functionalization to three in COF&#8208;1CN with mono&#8208;cyano functionalization and four in COF&#8208;2CN with dicyano functionalization, leading to the highest separation/transfer efficiency in COF&#8208;2CN. More importantly, the dicyano group activates the neighbouring C atom to produce the key *OH intermediate for effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation in H2O2 photosynthesis. The simultaneously enhanced exciton separation/transfer and two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COF&#8208;2CN result in high H2O2 yield (1601 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) from water and oxygen without using sacrificial reagent under visible&#8208;light irradiation. COF&#8208;2CN can effectively yield H2O2 in water with wide pH range, in different real water samples, in scaled&#8208;up reactor under natural sunlight irradiation, and in continuous&#8208;flow reactor for consecutively producing H2O2 solution for water decontamination.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Pentlandite by High&#8208;Spin State Iron for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triggering rapid reconstruction reactions holds the potential to approach&#160;the theoretical limits of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and spin state manipulation has shown great promise in this regard. In this study, the transition of Fe spin states from low to high was successfully achieved by adjusting the surface electronic structure&#160;of pentlandite. In&#8208;situ characterization and kinetic simulations confirmed that the high&#8208;spin state of Fe promoted&#160;the accumulation of OH&#8722;&#160;on the surface and accelerated&#160;electron transfer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the reconstruction reaction. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that the lower d&#8208;band center of high&#8208;spin Fe optimized&#160;the adsorption&#160;of active intermediates, thereby enhancing the reconstruction kinetics. Remarkably, pentlandites with&#160;high&#8208;spin Fe exhibited&#160;ultra&#8208;low overpotential (245 mV&#160;@&#160;10 mA cm&#8722;2) and excellent stability. These findings provided&#160;new insights for the design and fabrication of highly active OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain Boundary Tailors the Local Chemical Environment on Iridium Surface for Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even though grain boundaries (GBs) have been previously employed to increase the number of active catalytic sites or tune the binding energies of reaction intermediates for promoting electrocatalytic reactions, the effect of GBs on the tailoring of the local chemical environment on the catalyst surface has not been clarified thus far. In this study, a GBs&#8208;enriched iridium (GB&#8208;Ir) was synthesized and examined for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Operando Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a local acid&#8208;like environment with H3O+ intermediates was created in the GBs region owing to the electron&#8208;enriched surface Ir atoms at the GBs. The H3O+ intermediates lowered the energy barrier for water dissociation and provided enough hydrogen proton to promote the generation of hydrogen spillover from the sites at the GBs to the sites away from the GBs, thus synergistically enhancing the hydrogen evolution activity. Notably, the GB&#8208;Ir catalyst exhibited a high alkaline HER activity (10 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2, 20 mV dec&#8208;1). We believe that our findings will promote further research on GBs and the surface science of electrochemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiphasic Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactors for Handling Gaseous Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Enhancing Efficiency and Safety in Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using highly reactive gases is appealing for efficient organic synthesis but leads to inherent safety and processing limitations. Embracing continuous&#8208;flow technologies helps mitigating those while improving the performance of the systems. Tailored catalyst incorporation opens doors to novel reaction pathways and process intensification. Optimized mass transfer in multiphasic mixtures is key to its success, especially when solids are present.







Abstract
The use of reactive gaseous reagents for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge due to safety and efficiency limitations. The implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors has resulted in rapid development of gas&#8208;handling technology because of several advantages such as increased interfacial area, improved mass&#8208; and heat transfer, and seamless scale&#8208;up. This technology enables shorter and more atom&#8208;economic synthesis routes for the production of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of literature from 2016 onwards in the development of gas&#8208;handling continuous&#8208;flow technology as well as the use of gases in functionalization of APIs.

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li2S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li2S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.







Abstract
The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;), as both e&#8208;/Li+ donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long&#8208;range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Allylation of Trialkylamines with Allenes Promoted by Synergistic Borane/Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation reactions of trialkylamines with allenes were accomplished by a synergistic borane/palladium catalysis. The borane and palladium catalysts promoted the formation of an enamine intermediate from a trialkylamine and a palladium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate from an allene, respectively.







Abstract
Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8722;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Enhanced Methanol Synthesis over Self&#8208;Limited ZnOx Overlayers on Cu Nanoparticles Formed via Gas&#8208;Phase Migration Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn species evaporated from ZnO particles can migrate and deposit onto Cu surface to form Zn oxide (ZnOx) encapsulation layers i.e., strong metal&#8208;support interaction state under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C in ZnO||Cu catalyst. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species and growth of ZnOx overlayer on Cu surface is self&#8208;limited, which constructs an optimal number of ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites to have enhanced methanol synthesis activity.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Adaptive and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new water&#8208;soluble corral&#8208;shaped conjugated host bearing ten sulfate groups at its two rims&#8212;namely, SC[5]A&#8212;was synthesized. SC[5]A not only exhibited ultrahigh binding affinities (up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards a series of rod&#8208;shaped substrates, but also effectively bound (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) a wide range of functional substrates. Additionally, the application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide was explored.







Abstract
The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owing to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). Additionally, we've explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.

         <dc:description>
Introducing PAnt, a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging: PAnt (&#8220;phosphonic acid antenna&#8221;) is a small water&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna tailored to dynamically self&#8208;assemble with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable probe to overcome photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during acquisition are continuously replenished by intact PAnt antennas from a large reservoir, exhibiting remarkable photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, as reported by Angel Orte, Juan A. Gonz&#225;lez&#8208;Vera et&#8197;al. In their Communication (e202314595).

         <title>A Fully Amorphous, Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linked Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Operating at Subzero&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a fully amorphous quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a dynamic cross&#8208;linked network composed of a star&#8208;shaped plasticising polymer and a linear poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The electrolyte achieves high Li+ conductivity (2.96&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high tLi+ (0.81), and the as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit high reversible capacity and long cycle life when operating at subzero temperature conditions.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.

         <title>Inside Cover: Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly &#8208; Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of a dodecagonal columnar liquid quasicrystal is revealed by Carsten Tschierske, Feng Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202314454). Constructed by the T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles, a special trapezoid tile with three aromatic walls and one flexible aliphatic wall becomes crucial for reaching the delicate balance between steric and entropic effects required by quasiperiodicity.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) were employed as building blocks for crafting optical communicating assemblies. This approach relies on the selective functionalization of CNDs with clickable moieties and their subsequent controlled interconnection. This work provides new insights on the link between molecular and nanoscale events, paving the way to develop selective and addressable CNDs that can act as modular nanoscale synthons.







Abstract
The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material's outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8208;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H2 dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (Had) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdHx (PdHab) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&#8722; to form water.







Abstract
Tracking the trajectory of hydrogen intermediates during hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis is beneficial for designing synergetic multi&#8208;component catalysts with division of chemical labor. Herein, we demonstrate a novel dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism that leads to two orders of magnitude increase in the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity on Pd@Pt over pure Pd, even &#8776;31.8&#8197;times mass activity enhancement than commercial Pt. Specifically, the polarization&#8208;driven electrochemical hydrogenation process from Pd@Pt to PdHx@Pt by incorporating LH allows more surface vacancy Pt sites to increase the surface H coverage. The inverse dehydrogenation process makes PdHx as an H reservoir, providing LH migrates to the surface of Pt and participates in the HOR. Meanwhile, the formation of PdHx induces electronic effect, lowering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining Volmer step, thus resulting in the HOR kinetics on Pd@Pt being proportional to the LH concentration in the in situ formed PdHx@Pt. Moreover, this dynamic catalysis mechanism would open up the catalysts scope for hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Unlocking a Dual&#8208;Channel Pathway in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Single&#8208;Site Zirconium on Amorphous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom transition metals present extraordinary activity but are hard to be synthesized and stabilized. In their Research Article (e202312292), Jiafeng Yu, Anna Zimina, Jian Sun et&#8197;al. created SiO2&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;site Zr species by the flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) method, unlocking a dual&#8208;channel pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. A &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; limitation between the competitive formate and RWGS+CO&#8208;hydro pathways was broken. The highest overall methanol productivity was achieved when two pathways strike a balance.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of dienyl sulfoxides were accomplished with up to 98&#8201;% ee from both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters employing cheap Ni(II) as precatalyst. Experimental and computational methods revealed an interesting associated outersphere mechanism which is uncommon in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic nucleophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98&#8201;% ee. The product exhibits tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a series of tetrel sandwich complexes characterized by ten &#960;&#8208;electrons ([Li6]5+[E5]10&#8722;[Li6]5+). These complexes are both thermochemically and kinetically stable and exhibit &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
When (4n +2) &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of D5h&#8197;Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8722; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Asp1 and Asp7 in laspartomycin coordinate with a calcium cation to adopt the active conformation. When these residues were replaced by serine, calcium dependence was eliminated and the resulting synthetic analogue depended instead on phenylboronic acid for its antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show modes of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analogue (B1) whose activity no longer depends on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor it in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in B1 and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrate that B1 inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC, i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate. B1 is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy has been developed for preparation of polydienes with high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and end&#8208;group functionalization efficiency. This approach utilizes a novel catalytic system in which allylic&#8208;Al moiety exhibits remarkable selectivity for alkylation and transalkylation and improves the end&#8208;group functionality efficiency for polydiene synthesis, showcasing its immense potential for development of advanced polymeric materials.







Abstract
There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99&#8201;%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than that of the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Perylene Diimide Polymers with a Robust Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers were designed and synthesized such that the molecular orientation of the PDI units was regulated to create and modulate their built&#8208;in electric fields. Due to the large dipole moment and interfacial electric field, oPDI enables an extraordinary photocurrent density of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 11.5 and 26.8&#8197;times that of mPDI and pPDI, respectively.







Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field of the polymer semiconductors could be regulated by the dipole moment of its building blocks, thereby promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieving efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting. Herein, three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers, namely oPDI, mPDI and pPDI, are synthesized with different phenylenediamine linkers. Notably, the energy level structure, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and photogenerated carrier separation and migration of polymers are regulated by the orientation of PDI unit. Among them, oPDI enables a large dipole moment and robust built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in enhanced solar&#8208;driven water splitting performance. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, oPDI exhibits the highest photocurrent of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution, which is 11.5&#8197;times that of mPDI, 26.8&#8197;times that of pPDI and 104.6&#8197;times that of its counterparts PDI monomer at the same conditions. This work provides a strategy for designing polymers by regulating the orientation of structural units to construct efficient solar energy conversion systems.

         <title>Designing and Engineering Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for CO2 to CO Conversion: From Single to Dual Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to achieving sustainable electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion and storage while decarbonizing the emission&#8208;heavy industry. The carbon&#8208;supported, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated, and atomically dispersed metal sites are effective catalysts for CO generation due to their high activity, selectivity, and earth abundance. Here, we discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for designing and engineering atomic metal catalysts from single to dual metal sites. Engineering single metal sites using a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon model was highlighted to exclusively study the effect of carbon particle sizes, metal contents, and M&#8208;N bond structures in the form of MN4&#160;moieties on catalytic activity and selectivity. The structure&#8208;property correlation was analyzed by combining experimental results with theoretical calculations to uncover the CO2&#160;to CO conversion mechanisms. Furthermore, dual&#8208;metal site catalysts, inheriting the merits of single&#8208;metal sites, have emerged as a new frontier due to their potentially enhanced catalytic properties. Designing optimal dual metal site catalysts could offer additional sites to alter the surface adsorption to CO2&#160;and various intermediates, thus breaking the scaling relationship limitation and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2&#160;utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.</dc:description>

The CO2RR electrolysis in flow reactors was discussed to provide insights into the electrolyzer design with improved CO2&#160;utilization, reaction kinetics, and mass transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Cyclizative 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement Enabled Enantioselective Construction of 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Pyrrolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,2&#8208;rearrangement reaction is one of the most important approaches to construct carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in organic synthesis. However, the development of catalytic asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is still far from mature and often suffers from problems such as complex substrates, single product structure, and lack of synthetic application. Multicomponent reaction has been recognized as a robust tool for the synthesis of diverse and tunable products from readily available starting material. Conceptionally and practically, the development of multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements is highly desirable. In this regard, we report herein a three&#8208;component benzilic acid&#8208;type rearrangement of 2,3&#8208;diketoesters, aromatic amines and aldehydes for the asymmetric construction of synthetically challenging pyrrolinones bearing aza&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. To the best of our knowledge, this reaction represents the first example of organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric 1,2&#8208;rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hemin Binding by a Non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Aptamer with Higher Affinity and Better Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Previous aptamers for porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were all guanine&#8208;rich sequences that can fold in G&#8208;quadruplex structures. Due to stacking&#8208;based binding, these aptamers can hardly tell different porphyrins apart, and they can also bind other planar molecules, hindering their practical applications. In this work, we used the capture selection method to obtain aptamers for hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The hemin aptamer (Hem1) features two highly conserved repeating binding loops, and it cannot form a G&#8208;quadruplex, which was supported by its Mg2+&#8208;dependent but K+&#8208;independent hemin binding and CD spectroscopy. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed much higher enthalpy change for the new aptamer, and the best aptamer showed a Kd of 43 nM hemin. Hem1 can also enhance the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of hemin. This work demonstrates that aptamers have alternative ways to bind porphyrins allowing selective recognition of different porphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Isonitriles as Alkyl Radical Precursors in Visible Light Mediated Hydro&#8211; and Deuterodeamination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the use of isonitriles as alkyl radical precursors in light&#8208;mediated hydro&#8208; and deuterodeamination reactions. The reaction is scalable, shows broad functional group compatibility and potential to be used in late&#8208;stage functionalization. Importantly, the method is general for C&#945;&#8208;primary, C&#945;&#8208;secondary and C&#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl isonitriles. For most examples, high yields were obtained through direct visible&#8208;light irradiation of the isonitrile in the presence of a silyl radical precursor. Interestingly, in the presence of an organic photocatalyst (4CzIPN) a dramatic acceleration was observed. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies using UV&#8208;vis absorption, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopy suggest that the excited state of 4CzIPN can engage in a single&#8208;electron transfer with the isonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters towards High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are highly coveted for their high efficiency and narrowband emission in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) MR&#8208;TADF emitters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we design two new NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PXZ&#8208;R&#8208;BN and BCz&#8208;R&#8208;BN, by embedding 10H&#8208;phenoxazine (PXZ) and 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (BCz) fragments to increase the electron&#8208;donating ability or extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation on the framework of para&#8208;boron fusing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Both compounds emit in the NIR region, with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 49 nm (0.13 eV) for PXZ&#8208;R&#8208;BN and 43 nm (0.11 eV) for BCz&#8208;R&#8208;BN in toluene. To sensitize the two NIR MR&#8208;TADF emitters in OLEDs, a new platinum complex, Pt&#8208;1, is designed as sensitizer. The PXZ&#8208;R&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensitized OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of nearly 30% with emission peak at 693 nm, and exceptional long operational stability with LT97 (time to 97% of the initial luminance) of 39084 h at initial radiance of 1000 mW sr&#8208;1 m&#8208;2. The BCz&#8208;R&#8208;BN&#8208;based OLEDs acquire EQEmax of 24.2% with emission peak at 713 nm, which sets a record value for NIR OLEDs with emission peaks beyond 700 nm.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(III) fluorides are catalytically competent, yet elusive, intermediates in cross&#8208;coupling. The synthesis of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), the first stable (isolable) CuIII&#8722;F, was accomplished via chloride addition to [CuIII(CF3)3(py)] (1) yielding [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3Cl(py)] (1.Cl), followed by treatment with AgF. The CuIII halides 1.Cl and 2 were fully characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (Sc&#8208;XRD) and elemental analysis (EA). Complex 2 proved capable of forging C&#8722;CF3 bonds from silyl&#8208;capped alkynes. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies combining probes, theoretical calculations, trapping of intermediate 4a ([PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)]) and radical tests unveil the key role of the CuIII acetylides that undergo facile 2e&#8722; reductive elimination furnishing the trifluoromethylated alkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3), which are industrially relevant synthons in drug discovery, pharma and agrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructed Bismuth Oxide through in situ Carbonation by Carbonate&#8208;containing Electrolyte for Highly Active Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalyst&#8208;reconstruction makes it challenging to clarify the practical active sites and unveil the actual reaction mechanism during the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, currently the impact of the electrolyte microenvironment in which the electrolyte is in contact with the catalyst is overlooked and might induce a chemical evolution, thus confusing the reconstruction process and mechanism. In this work, the carbonate adsorption properties of metal oxides were investigated, and the mechanism of how the electrolyte carbonate affect the chemical evolution of catalysts were discussed. Notably, Bi2O3 with weak carbonate adsorption underwent a chemical reconstruction to form the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations unveiled the formation mechanism of the heterostructure. The in&#8208;situ formed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as the highly active structure for CO2RR, achieving a formate Faradaic efficiency of 98.1% at &#8208;0.8 Vvs RHE. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the significantly tuned p&#8208;orbit electrons of the Bi sites in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 optimized the adsorption of the intermediate and lowered the energy barrier for the formation of *OCHO. This work elucidates the mechanism of electrolyte microenvironment for affecting catalyst reconstruction, which contributes to the understanding of reconstruction process and clarification of the actual catalytic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkenylation of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H alkenylation of thioamides with but&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate ester coupling partners employing thioamide directing groups is presented. The method is operationally simple and requires only mild reaction conditions, while providing alkenylated products as single regioisomers in excellent yields (up to 85%) and high enantiomeric excess [up to 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), or up to &gt;99:1 er after a single recrystallization]. Diverse downstream derivatizations of the products are demonstrated, delivering a range of enantioenriched constructs. Extensive computational studies using density functional theory provide insight into the detailed reaction mechanism, origin of enantiocontrol, and the unusual regioselectivity of the alkenylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Quadruplex Structure with a Unique Cation Dependency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA quadruplex structures provide an additional layer of regulatory control in genome maintenance and gene expression and are widely used in nanotechnology. We report the discovery of a novel tetrastranded structure formed from a native G&#8208;rich DNA sequence originating from the telomeric region of Caenorhabditis elegans. The structure is defined by multiple properties that distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes. Most notably, the formation of a stable so&#8208;called KNa&#8208;quadruplex (KNaQ) requires concurrent coordination of K+ and Na+ ions at two distinct binding sites. This structure provides novel insight into G&#8208;rich DNA folding under ionic conditions relevant to eukaryotic cell physiology and the structural evolution of telomeric DNA. It highlights the differences between the structural organization of human and nematode telomeric DNA, which should be considered when using C. elegans as a model in telomere biology, particularly in drug screening applications. Additionally, the absence/presence of KNaQ motifs in the host/parasite introduces an intriguing possibility of exploiting the KNaQ fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique shape and ion dependency and the possibility of controlling its folding by using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight ligands can be exploited for the design or discovery of novel recognition DNA elements and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Hydrogen Production by Electrochemical&#8208;assisted Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methanol steam reforming (MSR) provides an alternative way for efficient production and safe&#160;transportation&#160;of hydrogen but requires harsh conditions and complicated purification processes. In this work, an efficient electrochemical&#8208;assisted&#160;MSR reaction for pure H2 production at lower temperature (~140 &#176;C) is&#160;developed by coupling the electrocatalysis reaction into the MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis reactor. By electrochemically assisted, the two critical steps including the methanol dehydrogenation&#160;and water&#8208;gas shift reaction&#160;are&#160;accelerated,&#160;which is attributed to decreasing the methanol dehydrogenation energy and promoting the dissociation of H2O to OH* by&#160;the applied potential. Furthermore,&#160;the reduced H2&#160;partial pressure by the hydrogen oxidation and reduction process further promotes MSR. The combination of these&#160;advantages not only&#160;efficiently&#160;decreases&#160;the MSR temperature but also achieves the high rate of hydrogen production of 505 mmol H2&#160;g Pt&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;with exceptionally high H2&#160;selectivity (99%) at 180 &#176;C and a low voltage (0.4 V), and the productivity is about 30&#8208;fold&#160;than that of traditional MSR. This study opens up a new avenue to design novel electrolysis cells for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ground&#8208;State Orbital Descriptors for Accelerated Development of Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are in high demand for optoelectronics and bioelectronics. Developing RTP materials highly relies on expert experience and costly excited&#8208;state calculations. It is a challenge to find a tool for effectively screening RTP materials.   Herein we first establish ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors (&#960;FMOs) derived from the &#960;&#8208;electron component of the frontier molecular orbitals to characterize the RTP lifetime (tp), achieving a  balance in screening efficiency and accuracy. Using the &#960;FMOs, a data&#8208;driven machine learning model gains a high accuracy in classifying long tp, filtering out 836 candidates with long&#8208;lived RTP from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules. With the aid of the excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 compounds are predicted with high RTP efficiency. Impressively, experiments further confirm the reliability of this workflow, opening a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance RTP materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Engineering Mediated by Cation Conjugation in Luminescent Uranyl&#8208;Organic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of compounds of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] is reported here, wherein Ar is systematically varied between pyridine (1&#8208;X), quinoline (2&#8208;X), acridine (3&#8208;X), 2,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazine (4&#8208;X), quinoxaline (5&#8208;X), and phenazine (6&#8208;X), and X = Cl or Br. With greater conjugation in the organic cation, a larger quenching in uranyl luminescence is observed in the solid state. Supporting our luminescence experiments with computation, we map out the potential energy diagrams for the singlet and triplet states of both the [HAr]+ cations and [UO2Cl4]2&#8722; anion in the crystalline state, and of the assembly. The distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Synergistic Effect of Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites Confined on the Edge of Monolayer CuInP 2 S 6 &#160;toward Selective Photoreduction of CO 2 &#160;into Multi&#8208;Carbon Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, single&#8208;crystal, hexagonal CuInP2S6&#160;atomically thin sheets of ~ 0.81 nm in thickness was successfully synthesized for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Exciting ethene (C2H4) as the main product was dominantly generated with the yield&#8208;based selectivity reaching ~56.4%, and the electron&#8208;based selectivity as high as ~74.6%. The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8211;In dual sites confined on the lateral edge of the CuInP2S6 monolayer (ML) is mainly responsible for efficient conversion and high selectivity of the C2H4&#160;product as the basal surface site of the ML, exposing S atoms, can not derive the CO2&#160;photoreduction due to the high energy barrier for the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of CO2&#160;into *COOH. The marginal In site of the ML preeminently targets CO2&#160;conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrates to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8208;C coupling reaction into C2H4&#160;with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Moreover, ultrathin structure of the ML also allows to shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface, thus inhibiting electron&#8208;hole recombination and enabling more electrons to survive and accumulate on the exposed active sites for CO2&#160;reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Intelligent DNA nanoreactor&#160;for&#160;in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging&#160;and precise therapy</title>

         <dc:description>Nanomaterial&#8208;based&#160;in vivo&#160;tumor imaging&#160;and therapy have attracted extensive attention, however,&#160;they suffer from the unintelligent &#8220;always ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, substantial&#160;off&#8208;target effects,&#160;and&#160;high&#160;cost.&#160;Therefore, achieving in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging and&#160;precise therapy&#160;in a multi&#8208;parameter responsive and intelligent manner remains challenging. Herein, an intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) was constructed&#160;following the&#160;&#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm to address these issues. iDNR&#8208;mediated in situ&#160;deposition of photothermal substance polydopamine (PDA) can only be satisfied in tumor tissues with abundant membrane protein biomarkers &#8220;AND&#8221; hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, intelligent temperature&#8208;based in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging is realized&#160;without expensive instrumentation, and&#160;its diagnostic performance matches with&#160;that of flow cytometry, and&#160;photoacoustic imaging. Moreover, precise photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors could be achieved via&#160;intelligent heating of tumor tissues.&#160;The precise PTT&#160;of primary tumors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy suppresses&#160;the growth of distant tumors and inhibits&#160;tumor recurrence. Therefore,&#160;highly programmable iDNR is&#160;a powerful tool for intelligent&#160;biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Biochemical Characterization of Pantaphos Biosynthesis Highlights an Unusual Role for a SAM&#8208;Dependent Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pantaphos is small molecule virulence factor made by the plant pathogen Pantoea ananatis. An eleven gene operon, designated hvr for high virulence, is required for production of this phosphonic acid natural product, but the metabolic steps used in its production have yet to be established. Here, we determine the complete biosynthetic pathway using a combination of bioinformatics, in vitro biochemistry and in vivo heterologous expression. Only six of the eleven hvr genes are needed to produce pantaphos, while a seventh is likely to be required for export. Surprisingly, the pathway involves a series of O&#8208;methylated intermediates, which are then hydrolyzed to produce the final product. The methylated intermediates are produced by an irreversible S&#8208;adenosylmethione (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferase that is required to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable dehydration in the preceding step, a function not previously attributed to members of this enzyme class. Methylation of pantaphos by the same enzyme is also likely to limit its toxicity in the producing organism. The pathway also involves a novel flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that differs from homologous proteins due to its endogenous flavin&#8208;reductase activity. Heterologous production of pantaphos by Escherichia coli strains expressing the minimal gene set strongly supports the in vitro biochemical data.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;domain Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer is essential to acquire helical hierarchical superstructures from the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular materials. By taking advantage of chirality transfers at different length scales through intra&#8208;chain and inter&#8208;chain chiral interactions, helical phase (H*) can be formed from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*). In this study, chiral triblock terpolymers, polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA), and polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;P4VP&#8208;PLLA) are synthesized for self&#8208;assembly. For PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA with an achiral PEO mid&#8208;block that is compatible with PLLA (chiral end&#8208;block), H* can be formed while the block length is below a critical value. By contrast, for the one with achiral P4VP mid&#8208;block that is incompatible with PLLA, the formation of H* phase would be suppressed regardless of the length of the mid&#8208;block, giving cylinder phase. Those results elucidate a new type of chirality transfer across the phase domain that is referred as cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer, providing complementary understanding of the chirality transfer at the interface of phase&#8208;separated domains.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key task in today&#8217;s inorganic synthetic chemistry is to develop effective reactions, routes, and associated techniques aiming to create new functional materials with specifically desired multilevel structures and properties. Herein, we report an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered composite of graphene ribbon and silicate via a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot reaction, which leads to the creation of a novel carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;silicate hybrid family: carbosilicate. The graphene ribbon is in&#8208;situ formed by unzipping carbon nanotubes, while the ultrathin silicate is in&#8208;situ obtained from bulk silica or commercial glass; transition metals (Fe or Ni) oxidized by water act as bridging agent, covalently bonding the two structures. The unprecedented structure combines the superior properties of the silicate and the nanocarbon, which triggers some specific novel properties. All processes during synthesis are complementary to each other. The associated synergistic chemistry could stimulate the discovery of a large class of more interesting, functionalized structures and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Radiochemistry with Fluorine&#8208;18, Carbon&#8208;11 and Zirconium&#8208;89</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review discusses recent advances in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry for three key isotopes: fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, and zirconium&#8208;89, and their applications in positron emission tomography (PET). In the case of fluorine&#8208;18, the predominant approach involves the use of cyclotron&#8208;produced [18F]fluoride or reagents derived thereof. Light serves to activate either the substrate or the fluorine&#8208;18 labeled reagent. Advancements in carbon&#8208;11 photomediated radiochemistry have been leveraged for the radiolabeling of small molecules, achieving various transformations, including 11C&#8208;methylation, 11C&#8208;carboxylation, 11C&#8208;carbonylation, and 11C&#8208;cyanation. Contrastingly, zirconium&#8208;89 photomediated radiochemistry differs from fluorine&#8208;18 and carbon&#8208;11 approaches. In these cases, light facilitates a postlabeling click reaction, which has proven valuable for the labeling of large biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies. New technological developments, such as the incorporation of photoreactors in commercial radiosynthesizers, illustrate the commitment the field is making in embracing photochemistry. Taken together, these advances in photomediated radiochemistry enable radiochemists to apply new retrosynthetic strategies in accessing novel PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis: Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (P&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of coordination polymers, have provided novel opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, compared with the ubiquitous phosphine systems in homogeneous catalysis, heterogenization of phosphines in MOFs is still at its early stage. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the P&#8208;MOFs reported in literature. In particular, various catalytic reactions are discussed in detail in terms of phosphine ligand structure&#8208;function relationship, including the potential obstacles for future development. Finally, we discuss the possible solutions, including new types of reactions and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities and challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8208; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8211; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8211; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1b) (Ar* = 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8211; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1a and 1b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8208;5.</dc:description>

         <title>Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel Hybrid Aromatic Metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes Constructed by a Formal [10+1] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic metalla&#8208;annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal&#8208;benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten&#8208;carbon chains in a one&#8208;pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Wingtip&#8208;Flexible N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Unsymmetrical Connection between IMes and IPr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IMes (IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and IPr (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) represent by far the most frequently used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in homogenous catalysis, however, despite numerous advantages, these ligands are limited by the lack of steric flexibility of catalytic pockets. We report a new class of unique unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of rotatable N&#8211;CH2Ar bond with conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8211;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr. These ligands are highly reactive in Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes, an archetypal borylcupration process that has had a transformative impact on the synthesis of boron&#8208;containing compounds. The most reactive Cu(I)&#8211;NHC in this class has been commercialized in collaboration with MilliporeSigma to enable broad access of the synthetic chemistry community. The ligands gradually cover %Vbur geometries ranging from 37.3% to 52.7%, with the latter representing the largest %Vbur described to date for an IPr analogue, while retaining full flexibility of N&#8208;wingtip. Considering the modular access to novel geometrical space in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis, we anticipate that this concept will enable new opportunities in organic synthesis, drug discovery and stabilization of reactive metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Crucial Photosensitizing Factors to Promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitizing ability of catalytic system was closely related to the visible&#8208;light absorption ability, excited&#8208;state lifetime, redox potential, and electron transfer rate of photosensitizers (PSs), however it remains a great challenge to concurrently mediate these factors to boost CO2 photoreduction. Herein, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based PSs (Ir&#8208;1 &#8211; Ir&#8208;6) were prepared as molecular platforms to understand the interplay of these factors and identify the primary factors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Among them, less efficient visible&#8208;light absorption capacity results in lower CO yields of Ir&#8208;1, Ir&#8208;2, or Ir&#8208;4&#8208;. Ir&#8208;3 shows most efficient photocatalytic activity among these mononuclear PSs due to some comprehensive parameters. Although the Kobs of Ir&#8208;3 is ~10 times higher than that of Ir&#8208;5, the CO yield of Ir&#8208;3 is slightly higher that that of Ir&#8208;5 due to the compensation of its strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing ability. Ir&#8208;6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance due to its strongest visible&#8208;light absorption ability, comparable thermodynamic driving force, and electron transfer rate among these PSs. Remarkably, the CO2 photoreduction to CO with Ir&#8208;6 can achieve 91.5 &#956;mol, over 54 times higher than Ir&#8208;1, and the TONC&#8208;1 was optimized to 28160. Various photophysical properties of the PSs were concurrently adjusted by fine ligand modification to promote CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of a Polyketide Synthase Module After C&#8208;C Bond Formation Reveals Transient Acyl Carrier Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant assembly lines producing an impressive range of biologically active compounds. However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter&#8208;domain interactions after C&#8208;C bond formation in a chain&#8208;branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism&#8208;based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor. The crosslinked protein allowed to identify an asymmetric state of the dimeric protein complex upon C&#8208;C bond formation by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The possible existence of two ACP binding sites, one of them a potential &#8220;parking position&#8221; for substrate loading, was also indicated by AlphaFold2 predictions. NMR spectroscopy showed that a transient complex is formed in solution independent of the linker domains, and photochemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry on the standalone domains allowed to pinpoint the interdomain interaction sites. The structural insights into a branching PKS module arrested after C&#8208;C bond formation allow a better understanding of domain dynamics and provide valuable information for the rational design of modular assembly lines.</dc:description>

However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter-domain interactions after C-C bond formation in a chain-branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism-based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor. The crosslinked protein allowed to identify an asymmetric state of the dimeric protein complex upon C-C bond formation by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

NMR spectroscopy showed that a transient complex is formed in solution independent of the linker domains, and photochemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry on the standalone domains allowed to pinpoint the interdomain interaction sites. The structural insights into a branching PKS module arrested after C-C bond formation allow a better understanding of domain dynamics and provide valuable information for the rational design of modular assembly lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Ion&#8208;Induced Large Fragment Deactivation: A Different Strategy for Site&#8208;Selectivity in a Complex Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to achieve site&#8208;selectivity by lowering a selected transition state energy. We invert this strategy by raising the energy of transition states representing undesirable sites through metal ion chelation, leaving desirable ones accessible to functionalization by a potentially wide variety of electrophilic synthetic methods.







Abstract
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to react exclusively at a desired site through lowering of a select transition state energy. In this communication, we report a new, complementary strategy in which all transition states representing undesirable sites in a complex ionophore substrate are simultaneously energetically increased through the chelation of a metal ion to the large fragment we wish to neutralize. In the case of an electrophilic, radical based fluorination reaction, charge repulsion (electric field effects), induced steric effects, and electron withdrawal provide the necessary deactivation and proof of principle to afford a highly desirable natural product derivative. We envisage that many other electrophilic or charge based synthetic methods may be amenable to this approach as well.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

         <title>Dynamic Monkey Bar Mechanism of Superionic Li&#8208;ion Transport in LiTaCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning force field molecular dynamics simulations reveal the superionic Li+ transport in glassy LiTaCl6 via the dynamic monkey bar mechanism&#8211;the high density and dynamics of the vibrating Cl&#8722; ions (the dynamic bars) allow Li ions to hold on to them while moving fast through the lattice.







Abstract
The LiTaCl6 solid electrolyte has the lowest activation energy of ionic conduction at ambient conditions (0.165&#8197;eV), with a record high ionic conductivity for a ternary compound (11&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). However, the mechanism has been unclear. We train machine&#8208;learning force fields (MLFF) on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data on&#8208;the&#8208;fly and perform MLFF MD simulations of AIMD quality up to the nanosecond scale at the experimental temperatures, which allows us to predict accurate activation energy for Li&#8208;ion diffusion (at 0.164&#8197;eV). Detailed analyses of trajectories and vibrational density of states show that the large&#8208;amplitude vibrations of Cl&#8722; ions in TaCl6&#8722; enable the fast Li&#8208;ion transport by allowing dynamic breaking and reforming of Li&#8722;Cl bonds across the space in between the TaCl6&#8722; octahedra. We term this process the dynamic&#8208;monkey&#8208;bar mechanism of superionic Li+ transport which could aid the development of new solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity. Recently, it has been shown that doping with oxophilic elements can significantly alleviate these problems, with a prominent example being Mo&#8208;doped Pt alloys. Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties. Beginning with the Mo/Pt system, we demonstrate that Mo can be stabilized in the form of low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide moieties on Pt defects. The resulting structures enhance stability and activity via distinct physical processes, with the Mo moieties both directly inhibiting Pt dissolution at defects and indirectly enhancing ORR activity by generation of strain fields on surrounding Pt terraces. We then generalize these analyses to other metal dopant elements, and we demonstrate that similar low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide structures control the electrocatalytic properties through an intricate interplay of the structures&#8217; acid stability, intrinsic activity for the ORR, and ability to induce ORR&#8208;promoting strain fields on Pt.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

The reaction combines carbonyl-olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine-promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>

Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.
