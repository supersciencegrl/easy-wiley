         <title>Ni&#8208;Mediated High&#8208;Spin Iron(III) for Boosting Electrocatalytic NO to Oxime Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops an advanced electrocatalyst (pFeNiPc) featuring nickel&#8208;mediated Fe sites electronic configurations, which exhibits superior performance in electrocatalytic synthesis of oximes from NO. Because the high&#8208;spin state of Fe(III) configurations robustly supports NO adsorption and reduction. It inspires optimizing the intrinsic properties of the catalyst by mediating its electronic structure.








Abstract
Oximes serve as indispensable intermediates in synthetic chemistry, owing to their distinctive C&#9552;N&#9472;OH structure, conferring highly versatile reactivity. Synthesis of oxime via the electrochemical method has potential advantages, accompanied by the upgrading of industrialization. Herein, we propose a novel strategy by introducing nickel (Ni) mediation to obtain high&#8208;spin iron (Fe)(III) in phthalocyanine structure for synthesizing glyoxylate oxime via electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) coupling with keto acid. The optimized pFeNiPc catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 84.3% and a long&#8208;term stability for glyoxylate oxime electrosynthesis. Moreover, the oxime could be directly cyclized to synthesize a gram&#8208;level agrochemical isoxazoline molecule. The enriched amounts of high&#8208;spin Fe(III) sites promote the accumulation of NO on the catalyst surface and further accelerate reduction, which enables the efficient adsorption&#8208;conversion of NO to oxime. This work devises an innovative strategy to selectively engineer the activation of catalytic sites by tailoring electronic configuration and presents a method to facilitate NO valorization in organonitrogen synthesis.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State and Interfacial Lock in Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers Enable Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;cable polymer extends the charge&#8208;transfer state lifetime to over 3&#160;ns, boosting the efficiency of ternary organic solar cells to 20.12%. It also serves as an interfacial lock at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, significantly enhancing device stability.








Abstract
The donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) critically govern exciton dissociation and molecular diffusion, determining both efficiency and stability. Herein, we design a double&#8208;cable conjugated polymer, SC&#8208;1F, to insert into a physically&#8208;blended D/A system to optimize the interface. We have found that SC&#8208;1F spontaneously segregates to the interface through favorable miscibility and heterogeneous nucleation with the acceptor. Its long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state with a lifetime of &gt;3&#160;ns enhances charge generation efficiency in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.00% to 20.12%. More importantly, the double&#8208;cable nature of SC&#8208;1F enables it to be simultaneously miscible with donor and acceptor so as to act as the interfacial lock to prevent their self&#8208;aggregation under thermal treatment. Therefore, the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based solar cells provided a high T80 of 2175 h compared to a T80 of 530 h based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 under 65 &#176;C treatment. Notably, SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based device demonstrates exceptional storage and thermal stability, with a T80 lifetime exceeding 10&#160;000 h. These results demonstrate the superior advantage of double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers as the third component to achieve efficient and stable OSCs.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Sequential Coordination&#8211;Covalent Construction of Symmetry&#8208;Broken MN2O2 Catalytic Sites in Cobalt&#8211;Polyimide Polymers for Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction sequence control: We report the construction of symmetry&#8208;broken MN2O2 sites in coordination polymers via sequential control in one&#8208;pot coordination&#8211;covalent reactions. The coordination occurs before the covalent reaction, allowing the two reactions to be completely separated to afford molecularly precise products with near&#8208;unity coordination degrees and homogeneously dispersed single metal atoms for efficient nitrate electroreduction.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;nitrogen chelated species, MN4, have shown promise as efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction, yet the symmetric arrangement of N atoms results in suboptimal adsorption affinity toward reaction substrates and intermediates. The current approaches to breaking the symmetry of MN4 suffer from inaccuracy and inhomogeneity because of the lack of strategies stemming from molecular design aspects. Herein, we report the construction of symmetry&#8208;broken MN2O2 sites in coordination polymers via sequential coordination&#8211;covalent control in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The dehydrogenating coordination preferentially occurs prior to the covalent imide&#8208;formation reaction, allowing the two reactions to be completely separated to afford molecularly precise polymer electrocatalysts that feature near&#8208;unity coordination degree and monodispersed atomic MN2O2 species with lowered symmetry, facilitating efficient nitrate reduction. Our study provides a design rationale to integrate diverse coordination and covalent chemistries into coordination polymers for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Heavyweight Champion: Caesium Diorganophosphides Outperform Lighter Congeners in the Catalytic Hydrophosphination of Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heavier, the better! We report that the caesium congener is the most active and versatile catalyst amongst a full group set of well&#8208;defined crown ether supported alkali metal diphenyl phosphides for catalytic hydrophosphination of various substrates and phosphines including aryl and alkyl phosphines. Furthermore, methods to generate P&#8208;chiral products, unsymmetrical ethylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphines, and alkene isomerization are presented.








Abstract
We present a study of the ability of our recently reported well&#8208;defined crown ether&#8208;coordinated alkali metal phosphides 1AM to catalyze hydrophosphination (HP) of alkynes and alkenes. In a comparative study including reaction monitoring by 1H NMR spectroscopy, we show that the activity of caesium compound 1Cs greatly exceeds that of its lighter congeners, enabling us to solve some reported challenges of catalytic hydrophosphination. Through the rarely used application of dialkyl phosphines, we were able to produce trialkyl phosphines from HP of styrene derivatives and activated as well as non&#8208;activated alkynes by catalytic HP with nBu2PH and tBu2PH. Using tBuPhPH, P&#8208;chiral products were obtained, still in racemic mixtures showcasing this system's potential. We also proved the method is suited for preparing unsymmetrical ethylene&#8208;bridged bisphosphines by HP of Ph2P(vinyl) isolable in high yields. These advances hint that well&#8208;defined organocaesium compounds could make a long&#8208;term impact in chemistry.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Driven Conformational Switching of Binaphthalene&#8208;Based Tetraimidazolium Macrocycles to Enhance Sequence&#8208;Selective Recognition of Dinucleotides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media using binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycle as artificial host is reported. The macrocycle undergoes reversible conformational switching with temperature, transitioning from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;conformation. This temperature&#8208;driven switching enhances binding with d(TpA) and achieves high sequence selectivity (Krel &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K) in water, demonstrating its potential for developing temperature&#8208;sensing optical devices for detecting DNA or RNA fragments with specific nucleotide sequences.








Abstract
Developing artificial hosts with temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching behaviors facilitates our understanding of the temperature&#8208;dependent allostery and adaptation mechanisms in natural recognition systems. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of three pairs of water&#8208;soluble, enantiomeric binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycles (SS/RR&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; &#8211; SS/RR&#8208;3&#8226;4Cl&#713;) as artificial hosts for exploring sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media. Owing to the reversible rotational conformation of axially chiral binaphthyl units, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; demonstrates the conformational switching, converting from cis&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1cis) to trans&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1trans) by increasing temperature, thereby causing the recognition cavity to transition from a closed to an open state. Given its ability for temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; exhibits temperature&#8208;cooperative enhanced binding behavior with d(TpA), with association constants (Ka) increasing to &#8764;106&#160;M&#8722;1 at 323&#160;K, up from &#8764;104&#160;M&#8722;1 at 288&#160;K. In contrast, its affinity for other dinucleotides, including d(ApT), d(GpC), and d(CpG), decreases to varying extents with increasing temperature. As a result, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713;, with an ability of temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, achieves an unexpected sequence&#8208;selective recognition for the sequence&#8208;complementary dinucleotide pair d(TpA) and d(ApT), with high sequence selectivity factors (Krel&#160;=&#160;Ka[d(TpA)]/Ka[d(ApT)]) reaching up to &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K, in water.

         <title>Tailoring the Magnetic Properties of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Networks by Harnessing the Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the engineering of the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanoarchitectures at interfaces. To this aim, we tailored the coordination environment adjusting the linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal stoichiometry. The on&#8208;surface synthesized networks exhibit distinct magnetic behaviors, transitioning from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to in&#8208;plane antiferromagnetism, while keeping the same oxidation state and spin quantum number (3/2).








Abstract
Achieving magnetic ordering in low&#8208;dimensional materials remains a key objective in the field of magnetism. Herein, coordination chemistry emerges as a powerful discipline to promote the stabilization of magnetism at the nanoscale. We present a thorough study of exemplary two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic nanoarchitectures synthesized on a Au(111) substrate, which are rationalized by using surface&#8208;science techniques and theoretical calculations. By tuning the stoichiometry, two distinct phases based on the same molecular linker coordinated with Co atoms are obtained, though featuring a different coordination sphere. Remarkably, our combined experimental and theoretical results suggest that for one phase the Co centers have an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antiferromagnetic ground state, whereas for the other the Co atoms display in&#8208;plane antiferromagnetism. These results pave new avenues for designing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic magnets and tailoring their inherent magnetic properties.

         <title>Tellurium&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Support Boosting Platinum Catalysis in High&#8208;Efficiency Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) and nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were introduced into graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC) to support small Pt nanoparticles (average size of 3.2&#160;nm) with uniform high loading (40 wt%), yielding the Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC catalyst. Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediated electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt enhanced high&#8208;voltage stability and the catalytic activity of Pt, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells necessitates optimization of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under high&#8208;voltage conditions through improved Pt catalysis. This study introduces an electrocatalyst that uniformly anchors a high loading (40 wt%) of small Pt nanoparticles (3.2&#160;nm) on a novel support: tellurium and nitrogen co&#8208;mediated graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC). The strong metal&#8211;support interactions arise from Pt&#9472;Te and Pt&#9472;N bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediation enhances the high&#8208;voltage oxidation resistance of Pt via electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt. Consequently, the Pt valence state in Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC increases by only +0.085 from open&#8208;circuit potential to 1.5&#160;V, resulting in exceptional durability over 100&#160;000 high&#8208;voltage cycles (1&#8211;1.5&#160;V) with negligible morphological aggregation. Moreover, the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, enabling Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC to achieve outstanding activity (0.7&#160;V at 1.26 A cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;air conditions). This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high&#8208;voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high&#8208;efficiency fuel cells.

The Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2&#8314; on surface trench&#8208;like structures of high lattice distortion MnOx, by inducing *OH generation/enrichment and electron transfer respectively, drive furoic acid (FA) dehydrogenation to carbon&#8208;centered FA radical (FA*), then reduce FA* to FA carbanion (FA&#8722;), completing Csp2&#9472;H bond activation. Under supercritical conditions (390&#160;K, 8&#160;MPa), solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 accelerates carboxylation of FA&#8722; to FDCA&#8722;, achieving 95.8% FDCA selectivity.








Abstract
Developing the efficient C&#9472;H bond activation carboxylation processes for furoic acid (FA) represents a critical technological challenge in achieving atom&#8208;economical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Despite notable advancements in this field, the inherent contradiction between the high reactivity of furan rings and the chemical inertness of C&#9472;H bonds poses substantial technical bottleneck for achieving controllable C&#9472;H carboxylation under mild conditions. Herein, we report a high lattice&#8208;distorted MnOx catalyst with surface trench&#8208;like structures, wherein the Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2+ cooperatively drive FA dehydrogenation and carbon radical reduction, inducing the free radical evolution process (FA&#8594;carbon&#8208;centered FA radical&#8594;FA carbanion), then coupled with solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 to accelerate the carboxylation process. This approach achieved an FDCA selectivity of 95.82% under mild reaction conditions (&#8804;390&#160;K), providing novel insights into mild activation and conversion of biomass&#8208;derived inert chemical bonds.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Dual&#8208;Anchor Design Enables Extreme&#8208;Condition Lithium Metal Batteries Through Solvation Reconstruction and Cathode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a cyclic borate molecule&#8208;based dual&#8208;interface stabilization strategy that achieves interfacial stabilization by anchoring anions to modulate the solvation structure and interfacial composition. This approach successfully enables stable cycling of lithium metal batteries under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have emerged as the most promising candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the inability of conventional carbonate electrolytes to simultaneously stabilize the lithium metal anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode interfaces, particularly under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we present a transformative molecular design using 3,5&#8208;difluorophenylboronic acid neopentyl glycol ester (DNE), which uniquely integrates dual interfacial stabilization mechanisms in a single molecule. Unlike conventional additives, DNE's Lewis acidic B&#9472;O bonds chemically anchor PF6&#8722; anions, reconstructing the Li+ solvation sheath to enable a lithium fluoride&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase that suppresses dendrites and lithium dendrite growth. Simultaneously, its cyclic borate ester undergoes in situ polymerization on the cathode surface, forming a transition metal ion&#8208;trapping network that optimizes the cathode electrolyte interphase and mitigates structural degradation in NCM811 cathodes. This synergistic dual&#8208;action mechanism endows Li||NCM811 cells with exceptional cycling stability under extreme conditions (4.7&#160;V, 60 &#176;C, and 5 C). Furthermore, a 1 Ah pouch cell with an energy density of 331&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 maintains 98.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles. This dual&#8208;interface molecular anchoring strategy establishes a design paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance LMBs suitable for operations in extreme conditions.

         <title>Bullvalene&#8208;Containing Molecular Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalenes (BVs) undergo rapid pericyclic rearrangements between a network of constitutional isomers with a variety of different shapes. Their inherent covalent disorder lends them to form molecular glasses. We find that their inclusion in the structures of glass&#8208;forming materials results in an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient.








Abstract
Organic molecular glasses are attractive matrices to disperse active ingredients in pharmaceuticals or electronic devices. Typically, they i) have lower glass transition temperatures than inorganic or polymeric glasses, making them easier to process, and ii) are less prone to phase segregation from other organic active materials. However, there is a dearth of functional groups that are known to induce glass formation in preference to crystallization. We have investigated the relationship between the shapeshifting isomerism of heterodisubstituted bullvalenes (BVs) and their properties as amorphous molecular glasses. Substituting a constitutionally dynamic BV unit in place of the 1,4&#8208;phenylene motif in the molecular structures of two well&#8208;known liquid crystal mesogens, 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;butylbiphenyl, produces materials that readily form glasses. The properties of the two glasses are compared to analogous glasses with fixed constitutions. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), we show that, unlike the fixed&#8208;structure glasses, the BV&#8208;containing molecular glasses fracture at low temperatures, which is indicative of them having larger thermal expansion coefficients. This article highlights the capability of shapeshifting building blocks to induce glass formation and to alter the physical properties of the resulting molecular materials, producing macroscopic effects that are observable by eye.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Crystalline Zinc&#8211;cAAC Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of an amidinate&#8208;stabilized zinc iodide with KC8 in the presence of cAAC affords a crystalline zinc&#8211;cAAC radical. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal the radical's properties, and reactivity studies demonstrate its zinc&#8208;centered radical behavior toward diverse substrates. 








Abstract
Reaction of LAmZnI [LAm&#160;=&#160;tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] with KC8 in the presence of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) affords a stable radical complex [LAmZn(cAAC)]&#8226; (3). Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis of 3 shows a short Zn&#9472;C bond and concomitant elongation of C&#9472;N bond within the cAAC ligand, indicating a significant &#960;&#8208;backbonding from the metal to the cAAC ligand. EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that the spin density is mainly localized on the carbenic carbon atom, with a small portion on the zinc center. Complex 3 exhibits zinc&#8208;centered radical reactivity as demonstrated by reactions with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy, iodobenzene, trimethylsilyl azide, and [FeCp(CO)2]2, all of which occur at the zinc center and yield the corresponding Zn(II) complexes.

         <title>Inverting the Rhodamine Paradigm: Closed&#8208;Form Fluorescence with 280 nm Stokes Shift Drives Plastic Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work inverts rhodamine photophysics by activating fluorescence in the traditionally dark lactone form via intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) reversal. The new dyes show record properties: &gt;280&#160;nm Stokes shift, &gt;25% solid&#8208;state quantum yield (&#966;), and dual plastic tracing/infrared (IR) encryption capabilities, enabling sustainable plastic circularity.








Abstract
Rhodamine derivatives exhibiting inverted open&#8208;closed form fluorescence behavior redefines conventional photochemical paradigms while illuminating new structure&#8211;property relationships and fascinating application potentials. Herein, we report a donor&#8211;acceptor engineering strategy that activates closed form emission in rhodamines, achieving unprecedented Stokes shifts (&gt;280&#160;nm) while overcoming aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The new class of rhodamines with inverted open&#8208;close form emission behavior are created through simultaneous substitution of N,N&#8208;diethyl groups with indole (donor) and conversion of spiro&#8208;lactam to benzene sulfonamide (acceptor). The closed structure was verified by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intramolecular spatial steric hinderance increased after indole substitution, which avoids exciton coupling and leads to bright fluorescence in solid state (absolute quantum yield&gt;25%). Density functional theory calculations confirmed inverted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) characteristics of the synthesized dyes versus rhodamine B, where moderate ICT gives higher fluorescence and strong ICT quenches fluorescence. Leveraging the unique photophysical properties of the novel rhodamines, a closed&#8208;loop plastic recycling scheme is proposed, where the dye in closed state is used for fluorescence tracing and the labelled unrecyclable plastics are utilized as encryption ink after acid treatment (open state). This finding highlighted a new insight for engineering fluorescence of rhodamine dyes and contributes to plastics sustainability.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Assisted Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient TADF Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.








Abstract
Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron&#8208;withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4tCzCN&#8208;pXT and 4tCzCN&#8208;pTXT, with multiple 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed.

&lt;p&gt;Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron-withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;CzCN-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;XT and 4&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;CzCN-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;TXT, with multiple 3,6-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed. They own increased molecular vibrations, which promote intrinsic RISC process and enable multi-channel transitions via vibronic coupling of high-lying triplet states. Consequently, they exhibit fast RISC rates of up to 1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, being one order of magnitude higher than that of the symmetric control molecule. They can perform as luminescent materials in OLEDs, providing outstanding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.2% and 35.8% in non-doped and doped devices, respectively, with very small roll-offs. The OLEDs using them as sensitizers for multi-resonance emitters achieve remarkable EQEs over 40%, and extraordinary operational stability with &lt;i&gt;LT&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; of 24974&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating their great potentials in OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Flow Photocatalysis Boosting C&#9472;N Coupling for Sustainable High&#8208;Efficiency Formamide Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A continuous flow photocatalytic platform for formamide synthesis via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of methanol and ammonia over the Pd clusters decorated TiO2 catalyst has been developed. The system has achieved a record formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 with 50 h stability in a Taylor flow reactor, which is significantly superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules.








Abstract
The construction of C&#9472;N bonds from simple precursors under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge in green chemistry, especially when it comes to avoiding energy&#8208;intensive protocols. Here, we present a continuous flow photocatalytic platform that enables the efficient coupling of C&#9472;N bonds between methanol and ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure. By synergistically engineering a Pd clusters&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst (1Pd/TiO2) and a mass transfer&#8208;enhanced gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid Taylor flow reactor, the system achieves a remarkable formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (6.83&#8208;fold enhancement compared to batch reactors) with less than 10% decay in production rate over 50 h of continuous operation, which is remarkably superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules. Distinguishing from the conventional simultaneous bimolecular one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway, a mechanistic study has shown that the precisely tailored Pd clusters on TiO2 induce charge polarization to drive methanol dehydrogenation toward critical *CH2O intermediates, enabling direct nucleophilic NH3 attack for C&#9472;N bond formation, thereby circumventing thermodynamic/kinetic barriers inherent to asynchronous radical generation in prior systems. This work establishes a paradigm for the sustainable, efficient synthesis of formamide via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling by bridging nanoscale photocatalyst engineering with macroscopic reactor design.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles dramatically change the performance of hydrazone photoswitches. Basic rings cause rapid thermal isomerization via tautomerization, while ones that can participate in H&#8208;bonding lower switching efficiencies. With this knowledge, new heterocyclic hydrazones were developed having higher photostationary states, better quantum yields, and red&#8208;shifted activation versus phenyl&#8208;based predecessors.








Abstract
The fine&#8208;tuning of the (photo)physical properties of molecular photoswitches remains an active area of research, and recently, the incorporation of heterocycles into photoswitch scaffolds has emerged as an effective strategy in this vein. To assess the influence that heterocyclic rings have on hydrazone&#8208;based systems, we synthesized a series of photoswitches and examined the impact that heterocycles have on the switching efficiency. TD&#8208;DFT calculations and structure&#8211;property analyses revealed that heterocycles with basic nitrogen and secondary hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites (e.g., imidazole) show poor switching efficiency and undergo thermal back&#8208;isomerization via an unusual mechanism involving tautomerization followed by rotation, resulting in fast thermal isomerization rates (i.e., half&#8208;lives of seconds to minutes). In contrast, less basic heterocycles such as benzoxazole and benzothiazole favor an inversion pathway, leading to improved bistability. Hydrazones lacking secondary hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites, on the other hand, exhibit significantly enhanced photostationary states, improved quantum yields, and red&#8208;shifted activation wavelengths compared to their 1st&#8208;generation phenyl&#8208;based analogs. These results showcase the importance of heterocycle basicity and electron&#8208;donating ability, in addition to secondary H&#8208;binding sites on photoswitching efficiency, features that are not fully elaborated on in other heterocycle&#8208;containing switches. These findings, based on the 2nd generation hydrazone switches, establish key design principles for tuning the bistability and efficiency of such photoswitches.

         <title>Controlling the Regioselectivity of Topochemical Reduction Reactions Through Sequential Anion Insertion and Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction reactions allow the preparation of metastable materials containing low&#8208;valent transition&#8208;metal cations. By adopting a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regioselectivity of these reactions can be modified, allowing the connectivity of the transition&#8208;metal coordination polyhedra in the resulting materials (1D vs. 2D) to be controlled.








Abstract
Topochemical reduction of the n&#160;=&#160;2 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide, LaSr2CoRuO7, yields LaSr2CoRuO5.3, a phase containing (Co/Ru)O4 squares which share corners to form 1D infinite double&#8208;chains. In contrast, fluorination of LaSr2CoRuO7 yields the oxyfluoride LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5, which can then be reduced to form LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5. This reduced oxyfluoride is almost isoelectronic with LaSr2CoRuO5.3, but LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 has a crystal structure in which the (Co/Ru)O4 squares are connected into 2D infinite sheets. Thus, by following a fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce reaction scheme, the regiochemistry of topochemical reduction reactions can be modified, and compounds with different transition&#8208;metal&#8208;centre interconnectivity can be prepared. Both LaSr2CoRuO5.3 and LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5 adopt glassy magnetic states at low temperature, but the magnetic interactions present in LaSr2CoRuO5.3 appear to be significantly stronger than those in LaSr2CoRuO4.5F1.5, attributable to the differing dimensionality of the transition&#8208;metal connectivity. The structural features of LaSr2CoRuO5.5F3.5 that modify the regioselectivity of the topochemical reduction reaction appear to be common to many fluorinated Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxides, suggesting this fluorinate&#8208;then&#8208;reduce strategy could be used to prepare a range of &#8220;infinite&#8208;layer&#8221; reduced phases which cannot be made by direct reduction of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide precursors.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Membrane&#8208;Bound Compartment for Precise Regulation of Enzyme Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, we report a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment composed of photoisomerizable phenylazothiazole lipids and phospholipids, which enables reversible and graded regulation of enzyme activity. This biomimetic strategy operates without enzyme modification and mutagenesis, offering a versatile and biocompatible platform applicable to a broad range of enzymes.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive systems provide a powerful tool to reversibly regulate enzyme activity. However, inhibitor&#8208;based strategies, though widely used, are often restricted to specific enzymes. Noninhibitor strategies, such as enzyme surface modification or genetic mutation, often compromise structural integrity or residual activity. Inspired by the gating mechanisms of biological membranes, we reported a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment system constructed from phenylazothiazole gated lipids and phospholipids. In this design, phenylazothiazole lipids undergo reversible isomerization between trans and cis configurations under alternating purple and green light, generating continuous nanomechanical motions that transiently enhance membrane permeability. This dynamic gating behavior enables substrate diffusion across the membrane under light exposure and allows the activity of encapsulated enzymes to be switched on and off in a noninvasive, temporally defined manner. This system requires no chemical modification or mutagenesis, thus preserving the native structure and activity of encapsulated enzymes. Beyond binary regulation, precise modulation of the irradiation pattern permits graded control over enzyme activity, offering an advanced level of functional tunability. Using carbonic anhydrase, catalase, and glucose oxidase as models, we demonstrate that enzyme activity can be reversibly and quantitatively regulated via programmable light inputs. This strategy offers a broadly applicable and biocompatible platform for spatiotemporal enzyme regulation.

     alt="Visible Light-Driven Membrane-Bound Compartment for Precise Regulation of Enzyme Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nature, we report a visible light-driven membrane-bound compartment composed of photoisomerizable phenylazothiazole lipids and phospholipids, which enables reversible and graded regulation of enzyme activity. This biomimetic strategy operates without enzyme modification and mutagenesis, offering a versatile and biocompatible platform applicable to a broad range of enzymes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-responsive systems provide a powerful tool to reversibly regulate enzyme activity. However, inhibitor-based strategies, though widely used, are often restricted to specific enzymes. Noninhibitor strategies, such as enzyme surface modification or genetic mutation, often compromise structural integrity or residual activity. Inspired by the gating mechanisms of biological membranes, we reported a visible light-driven membrane-bound compartment system constructed from phenylazothiazole gated lipids and phospholipids. In this design, phenylazothiazole lipids undergo reversible isomerization between &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configurations under alternating purple and green light, generating continuous nanomechanical motions that transiently enhance membrane permeability. This dynamic gating behavior enables substrate diffusion across the membrane under light exposure and allows the activity of encapsulated enzymes to be switched on and off in a noninvasive, temporally defined manner. This system requires no chemical modification or mutagenesis, thus preserving the native structure and activity of encapsulated enzymes. Beyond binary regulation, precise modulation of the irradiation pattern permits graded control over enzyme activity, offering an advanced level of functional tunability. Using carbonic anhydrase, catalase, and glucose oxidase as models, we demonstrate that enzyme activity can be reversibly and quantitatively regulated via programmable light inputs. This strategy offers a broadly applicable and biocompatible platform for spatiotemporal enzyme regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin Frustration Determines the Stability and Reactivity of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Triangular Iron(III)&#8211;Oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard DFT fails to capture the spin&#8208;frustrated ground state of triangular Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to distorted geometries and incorrect binding predictions. Using flip&#8208;spin DFT, we identify the true ground state of MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and show how magnetic frustration governs temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding, underscoring the need to treat spin effects accurately.








Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) is the standard approach for modeling MIL&#8208;101(Fe) and related Fe&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks, typically assuming a ferromagnetic high&#8208;spin configuration. However, this widely adopted approach overlooks a key electronic feature: Spin frustration in the triangular Fe3(&#956;3${\rm Fe}_{3}(\mu _{3}$&#8208;O) nodes. Using flip&#8208;spin, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT, we identify the true ground state as an antiferromagnetic 2S+1=6$2S+1=6$ state that standard DFT fails to capture. We demonstrate that neglecting spin frustration in MIL&#8208;101(Fe) leads to structural distortions, incorrect energetics, and misleading predictions of stability and reactivity. By explicitly accounting for spin frustration, we recover the correct structure and rationalize the temperature&#8208;dependent N2${\rm N}_{2}$ and CO binding. Spin frustration enhances N2${\rm N}_{2}$ fixation at room temperature, while its loss upon partial FeIII${\rm Fe}^{\mathrm {III}}$ reduction suppresses this activity but promotes CO adsorption via &#960;$\pi$&#8208;backbonding. These findings challenge current computational conventions and highlight spin frustration as a critical electronic feature in these&#160;frameworks.

         <title>On&#8208;Target Photoassembly of Pyronin Dyes for Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of diaryl ether and diaryl silane compounds bearing hydrazone substituents that, upon irradiation, cyclize to a fluorescent (silicon&#8722;)pyronin dye. After optimizing their photophysical properties, we introduced reactive tags into their structure for biological labeling, and demonstrated their utility in STED, PALM, and MINFLUX super&#8208;resolution microscopy.








Abstract
Controlled photoactivation is an auspicious and emerging approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy, offering virtually zero background signal from the marker prior to activation. Pyronins are well&#8208;established fluorophores, but due to their inherent intercalating tendency towards nucleic acids, their use has been mostly avoided in super&#8208;resolution microscopy. Here, we describe a new class of diaryl ether and diaryl silane molecules that upon photoactivation close into fluorescent (silicon&#8722;)pyronins and term them Pyronin Upon Light Irradiation (PULI). This concept exploits the outstanding photophysical properties of pyronins (bright, photostable, and optimal spectral features for standard microscopes), while overcoming their major drawback (intrinsic affinity of accumulating in the nucleus and around RNA) for the design of fluorescent markers for imaging applications. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that this approach is applicable to their Si&#8208;bridged analogues, extending this family of photoactivatable molecules to the far&#8208;red regime. The versatility of our approach was also highlighted by tagging diverse biological targets in cells and visualizing them using advanced super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques, such as PALM, STED, and MINFLUX.

         <title>Wavelength Selective Single Molecule Photobase/Photoacid Generator Enabling Dynamic Control of Soft Matter Materials Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzophenazine&#8208;based photocleavable platform enables wavelength&#8208;selective, sequential release of a base (TMG) and an acid (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) by blue and UV light irradiation, respectively. The photochemical reaction system can be applied in wavelength selective ligation and degradation of a polymer crosslinked structure.








Abstract
Photoremovable protecting groups (PRPGs) enable precise spatiotemporal control over molecular release and functional activation. Recent advances have introduced wavelength&#8208;selective systems for sequential deprotection, broadening applications in drug delivery, material synthesis, and photopolymerization. In parallel, PRPGs play a crucial role in photobase generators (PBGs) and photoacid generators (PAGs), enabling oxygen&#8208;tolerant, spatially controlled polymerization and depolymerization through light&#8208;induced base and acid release. Herein, we present a novel benzophenazine&#8208;based photocleavable system capable of the sequential, wavelength&#8208;selective release of both a base and an acid. This design integrates 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine (TMG) and p&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid functionalities, which are independently uncaged upon irradiation with blue (&#8805; 410&#160;nm) and UV (&#8805; 310&#160;nm) light, respectively. We demonstrated the versatility of this dual&#8208;responsive system in modulating soft matter properties, including wavelength&#8208;selective polymer crosslinking, degradation, and debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand adhesives. This work establishes a new platform for advanced photochemical control over polymeric transformations, with broader implications in responsive soft matter engineering.

         <title>MitoSiege&#8208;Driven Catalase Collapse: A GSH&#8208;Responsive, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted COF Prodrug for Amplified Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of mitochondria&#8208;targeted nanomedicine is achieved by incorporating into COFs a prodrug, which is a catalase inhibitor and a Fenton&#8208;like reaction copper complex linked by a disulfide bond. These findings confer organelle&#8208;specific targeting properties to COF materials for efficient delivery of therapeutic drugs and enhanced cancer dynamic therapy.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), leveraging Fenton reactions to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) from intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), offers a promising cancer treatment strategy due to its high specificity and low systemic toxicity. However, the targeted delivery of &#8226;OH&#8208;producing prodrugs using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a mitochondria&#8208;targeted COF&#8208;based nano prodrug, COF&#8208;31@P, designed for enhanced CDT efficacy. COF&#8208;31@P is composed of a Fenton&#8208;like copper complex and the hydrogen peroxide enzyme inhibitor 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole (3&#8208;AT), linked via disulfide bonds that are selectively cleaved by tumor&#8208;specific glutathione (GSH). This cleavage triggers the release of active components, resulting in robust &#8226;OH generation and effective eradication of cancer cells. The platform demonstrates precise mitochondrial targeting, high therapeutic efficiency, and excellent biocompatibility in vivo. By combining organelle targeting and multi&#8208;synergistic &#8226;OH generation production, our COF&#8208;31@P represents a significant advancement in CDT and holds strong potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Truxenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework/Carbon Nanotube Composite for High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode exhibits excellent sodium storage performance at low temperature with high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries face great challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Redox covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with porous structures provide a viable solution to accelerate the ionic diffusion and reaction kinetics at low temperatures. However, the applications of COFs in low&#8208;temperature batteries are still at their infancy stage. Here, a composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The truxenone&#8208;based COF possesses high ratio of active centers and enables high theoretical capacity; while the CNTs guarantee the accessibility of the active sites, the charge transfer efficiency, and the fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the composite electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 365 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 (295 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution). Notably, it offers excellent low&#8208;temperature performance that maintains a high discharge capacity of 263.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (203 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) at 0 &#176;C, which represents 74% of the capacity at room temperature. Even under extreme weather of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the capacity maintains 156.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (119 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 97%. This work illustrates the synergistic effect of the fast ionic diffusion of truxenone&#8208;based COF and the excellent charge transfer of the CNTs, offering a feasible way to realize low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature rechargeable batteries face great challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Redox covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with porous structures provide a viable solution to accelerate the ionic diffusion and reaction kinetics at low temperatures.

         <title>Hydrogen Radical Mediated Concerted Electron&#8722;Proton Transfer in 1D Sulfone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework for Boosting Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen radical&#8208;mediated concerted electron&#8722;proton transfer strategy was employed for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production using 1D&#8208;COF. The planar dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone units in the 1D skeleton edge enables efficient hydrogen radical production, thereby promoting the photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction to produce H2O2. 








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Despite their advantages, the reported COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts suffer insufficient photocatalytic H2O2 efficiency due to the mismatched electron&#8208;proton dynamics. Herein, we report three one&#8208;dimensional (1D) COF photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production via the hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) mediated concerted electron&#8722;proton transfer (CEPT) process. The DOTh&#8208;COF which features dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DOTh) moieties in the 1D skeleton edges achieves a high H2O2 production rate of 10.87&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 13.5% at 420&#160;nm in a biphasic water/benzyl alcohol system. The fs&#8208;TAS and in&#8208;situ EPR analyses demonstrate the DOTh moieties facilitate the charge separation, proton affinity, and exciton dissociation, enabling enhanced H&#8226; production. Mechanistic studies reveal that the H&#8226; reacts with O2 with high rate through both one&#8208;step and two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; pathways, thereby achieving efficient photosynthesis of H2O2. This work provides an effective design strategy for COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts and highlights the significance of H&#8226; mediated CEPT process in artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Considerations in Pursuing Reaction Scope Generality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods that are applicable to a broad range of substrates are sought after, owing to their utility in industrial settings. This minireview describes considerations associated with how chemists define and identify general methods, especially with the emergence of modern analytical, high&#8208;throughput, and data science tools in chemistry, and gives the reader an overview of workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.








Abstract
The term &#8220;generality&#8221; has recently been popularized in synthetic chemistry, owing largely to the increasing use of high&#8208;throughput technology for producing vast quantities of data and the emergence of data science tools to plan and interpret these experiments. Despite this, the term has not been clearly defined, and there is no standardized approach toward developing a method with a diverse (general) scope. This minireview will examine different emerging strategies toward achieving generality using selected examples and aims to give the reader an overview of modern workflows that have been used to expedite this pursuit.

A 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZNU&#8208;30) is assembled from 1D coordination polymers and demonstrates efficient separation of trace water vapor from C1&#8208;C3 alkene/alkanes and CO2. The cover image symbolizes the capability of ZNU&#8208;30 to capture trace H2O molecules (the orange&#8208;red fish) from CH4 (the larger yellow fish) by a combination of hydrogen bonding and molecular sieving effect. Further details are reported by Banglin Chen, Yuanbin Zhang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202515257).

         <dc:description>
Optical microscopy is commonly used to observe simple turn&#8208;on/off phenomena in chemical reactions. A method is presented for the real&#8208;time monitoring of diverse reaction pathways at the single&#8208;molecule level using optical microscopy. This technique enables detailed kinetic and dynamic studies to be performed, providing new insights into catalyst design and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Investigation of the fundamental microscopic processes occurring in organic reactions is essential for optimising both organocatalysts and synthetic strategies. In this study, single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was employed to study the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction catalysed by a first&#8208;generation MacMillan catalyst, providing direct insights into its kinetic dynamics. This reaction proceeds via a series of reversible processes under equilibrium conditions (S &#8644; IM1 &#8644; IM2 &#8594; P, IM1 and IM2: N,O&#8208;acetal and iminium ion intermediates, respectively). The individual reaction trajectories of single molecules were directly observed in real&#8208;time, and the kinetic transitions between the different states were quantitatively analysed using a hidden Markov model, thereby enabling precise determination of the kinetic rate constants and transition probabilities at the single&#8208;molecule level. In particular, the unique structural features of the MacMillan catalyst were probed to reveal how specific interactions stabilise the reaction intermediates and influence their kinetic behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of organic reactions and guiding the rational design of more effective catalysts.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxyalkynylation of &#945;&#8208;Unfunctionalized Alcohols with Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxyalkynylation of &#945;&#8208;unfunctionalized alcohols: A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical deoxyalkynylation of &#945;&#8208;unfunctionalized alcohols with terminal alkynes has been achieved, offering a versatile platform for the synthesis of diverse alkynes. The development of an N,N,N&#8208;ligand and selection of a suitable oxidant are pivotal in steering the reaction pathway and suppressing competing side reactions.








Abstract
Despite the widespread utility of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings in organic synthesis, the coupling of unactivated alkyl electrophiles remains challenging due to sluggish oxidative addition and competing side reactions. Here, we describe a general and practical copper&#8208;catalyzed radical deoxyalkynylation of &#945;&#8208;unfunctionalized alcohols through a synergistic combination of Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation and copper&#8208;catalyzed radical cross&#8208;coupling. Key to the success of this method lies in not only the development of rigid anionic multiple N,N,N&#8208;ligand to exert remarkable selectivity of highly reactive unactivated alkyl radicals, but also the selection of one suitable oxidant to suppress Glaser homocoupling and other side products. This method provides a complementary approach for the cross&#8208;coupling of unactivated alkyl halides, which face notable difficulties in reaction initiation and bond formation under mild thermal conditions, especially the tertiary variants. This protocol not only exhibits a broad scope with respect to both coupling partners, covering alkyl&#8208; and (hetero)aryl alkynes, as well as &#945;&#8208;unfunctionalized primary&#8208;, secondary&#8208;, and tertiary&#8208; alcohols with good functional group compatibility, but also facilitates the late&#8208;stage functionalization of a series of important natural and bioactive complex molecules.

         <title>High Performance Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Battery Electrolytes Regulation Mechanism: A Review</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulatory mechanism of sulfur&#8208;based solid electrolytes was reviewed in detail. Based on the problems of thermodynamic and kinetic instability and failure that exist, the mechanism of the regulation strategy was explored from aspects such as the soft&#8211;hard&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and the glass structure theory. It provides an important reference for the future development of sulfur&#8208;based SEs with both air stability, high ionic conductivity, and good contact performance.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) exhibit excellent ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties, but their poor air stability and solid&#8211;solid contact performance seriously hinder the wide application of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Herein, this paper reviews the history and the major breakthroughs in the development of sulfide SEs. The theories of hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and glass structure theory, as well as several strategies to improve the chemical stability of sulfide SEs, are discussed emphatically. In addition, this paper also explores its thermal runaway mechanism and reaction mechanism from the aspects of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, providing a reference for the research on improving stability and electrical conductivity. Finally, we summarized the challenges that still need to be addressed at present, as well as the research directions and prospects of sulfide SEs for ASSBs in the future.

         <title>Changing Self&#8208;Assembly Through Degradation: Phenyl Vinyl Ketone Polymer Nanoparticles Under Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodegradable nanoparticles with sphere, worm, and vesicle morphologies are created via PISA using photo responsive PVK and non&#8208;responsive HPMA blocks. Under UV light, worms quickly transform into spheres, while spheres and vesicles retain their shapes despite chain scission. Degradation also tailors surface properties and enables controlled release, offering promising applications in smart coatings, responsive materials, and targeted delivery systems.








Abstract
Photodegradable nanoparticles with sphere, worm, and vesicle morphologies were synthesized following polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), incorporating a photoresponsive phenyl vinyl ketone (PVK) block and a nonphoto responsive 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylamide (HPMA) block. The photodegradation of nanoparticles under UV revealed that the initial shapes of sphere and vesicle particles are retained even until 7&#160;h and after 24&#160;h of photo&#8208;induced degradation, respectively, despite a significant reduction in molecular weight (Mn). This could be due to the assembly of degraded PVK fragments in the hydrophobic region, maintaining the relative hydrophilic to hydrophobic ratio. However, worm nanoparticles exhibited a fast morphology reversal after 2&#160;min of degradation, yielding sphere nanoparticles. Therefore, photo responsive PVK nanoparticles with morphology and conversion&#8208;dependent degradation behavior were explored. Furthermore, undegraded and degraded nanoparticle coatings exhibited different surface properties, determined by contact angle measurements, with both morphology and degradation impacting the surface properties. Finally, the PVK nanoparticles could encapsulate molecules and release them upon degradation. Therefore, this study can ultimately be applied to numerous fields due to the potential uses of degradable polymers in various material systems, especially for the controlled release of agrochemicals, cleaning agents, or antifungal agents, as well as to enable surface modifications upon degradation.

         <title>Asymmetric Electronic Distribution at Mn&#8211;Cu Dual Atomic Sites Promoting Electrochemical Conversion of N2 to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatomic Mn&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst is designed for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3. The asymmetric electron distribution at the synergistic dual atomic Mn&#8211;Cu site simultaneously facilitates N2 adsorption and activation, where Cu acts as a co&#8208;catalyst. The DA&#8211;MnCu/NC catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 67.8% (&#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE) at ambient condition.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of ammonia (NH3) is a promising green alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. Here, we report the synthesis of a heteroatomic metal&#8211;metal bonded dual atomic (DA) Mn&#8211;Cu catalytic site embedded within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) matrix for high&#8208;performance electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3. The asymmetric electronic distribution localized at the dual atomic sites synergistically enhances the adsorption and activation of N2, facilitating the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Compared to single atomic (SA)&#8211;Mn/NC, DA&#8211;MnCu/NC exhibits a fourfold increase in nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance, achieving a higher Faradaic efficiency of 67.76&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7% and 88.34&#160;&#177;&#160;3.6&#160;&#181;g mgcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.15&#160;V (versus RHE) in 0.5&#160;M NaBF4 medium. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates long&#8208;term stability, retaining its performance over extended operation. This work presents valuable insights into the design of dual atomic catalysts and highlights the critical role of the localized electronic distribution at the catalytic sites in enabling sustainable NH3 synthesis.

Neuromelanin is a pigment in the brain and an effective metal chelator. It is likely a crucial factor in the viability of neurons, which has sparked interest in MRI biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In their Research Article (e202509102), Harald E. M&#246;ller and co&#8208;workers demonstrate remarkable complexity of the binding of Fe and Cu to synthetic neuromelanin analogues, with different binding sites, competition, and intricate magnetic properties, all of which affect the proton relaxation of surrounding water, the main contrast mechanism in MRI.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentagonal&#8208;heptagonal rings act like &#8220;water droplets&#8221; falling into the carbon layers, inducing a water&#8208;like ripple effect in the carbon atomic layers. Consequently, it renders electrons to exhibit a water&#8208;ripple&#8208;like enrichment phenomenon, greatly enhancing sodium storage capability, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202512725).

         <title>Programmable Vertical Expansion of Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Frameworks via Molecular Pillar Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving &#197;ngstrom&#8208;precise interlayer control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains elusive. We demonstrate water&#8208;based engineering of bilayer SOFs using length&#8208;tunable bipyridine pillars (L2/L3). Coordination&#8208;driven assembly with a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF yields crystalline bilayers with thicknesses of 5.4&#160;and 6.7&#160;nm&#8212;validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This pillar&#8208;length&#8208;to&#8208;spacing correlation enables sub&#8208;nm precision, opening avenues for tailored interlayer environments.








Abstract
Achieving quantitative control over interlayer spacing in multilayer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a&#160;molecular pillar engineering strategy&#160;enabling programmable vertical expansion of bilayer architectures. By designing elongated bipyridine pillars&#160;L2/L3&#160;(3.0/4.4&#160;nm) with hydrophilic side chains, we transform a Zn&#8208;porphyrin/CB[8] monolayer SOF (ml&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF, 1.8&#160;nm) into bilayers with&#160;precision&#8208;tuned&#160;thicknesses:&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;2&#160;(5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm) and&#160;bl&#8208;2D&#8208;SOF&#8208;3&#160;(6.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nm). Synchrotron small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) lattice imaging, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirm structural regularity with&#160;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level accuracy&#160;in layer spacing. Crucially, we establish a&#160;linear correlation between pillar length and interlayer distance, while multivalency&#8208;driven assembly ensures&#160;&gt;93% bilayer selectivity. This work pioneers quantitative 3D engineering in 2D SOFs, opening avenues for tailored nanoconfined environments.

         <title>Interfacial Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL&#8208;125@ZIF&#8208;8 catalyst, featuring asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfacial sites, enables photocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and N2. At the Zn sites, CO2 is reduced to *CO species, while N2 is activated at the Ti sites to form *NH&#8211;NH intermediates. The asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfaces facilitate the coupling of *CO with *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urea photosynthesis.








Abstract
Urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 has profound environmental and energy implications. However, the simultaneous activation of CO2 and N2, along with the promotion of C&#9472;N bond formation, remains a major challenge. Herein, the asymmetric interfacial sites (Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti) were engineered by building oxygen atom bridges between ZIF&#8208;8 and MIL&#8208;125 to enable efficient photocatalytic urea synthesis. The optimized Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interface structure achieves a urea yield of 130&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water and an apparent quantum yield of 5.52% at 350&#160;nm, outperforming most materials reported for urea photosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Zn sites catalyze the conversion of CO2 to *CO species, while Ti sites adsorb and activate N2 to generate *NH&#8211;NH species. The asymmetric interfacial sites lower the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby promoting urea photosynthesis. This work provides significant insights into designing interfacial asymmetric sites to facilitate photosynthetic organic chemicals for upgrading the nitrogen cycle.

&lt;p&gt;The MIL-125@ZIF-8 catalyst, featuring asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfacial sites, enables photocatalytic urea synthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. At the Zn sites, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to *CO species, while N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is activated at the Ti sites to form *NH&#8211;NH intermediates. The asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfaces facilitate the coupling of *CO with *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urea photosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urea photosynthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has profound environmental and energy implications. However, the simultaneous activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, along with the promotion of C&#9472;N bond formation, remains a major challenge. Herein, the asymmetric interfacial sites (Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti) were engineered by building oxygen atom bridges between ZIF-8 and MIL-125 to enable efficient photocatalytic urea synthesis. The optimized Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interface structure achieves a urea yield of 130&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water and an apparent quantum yield of 5.52% at 350&#160;nm, outperforming most materials reported for urea photosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Zn sites catalyze the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to *CO species, while Ti sites adsorb and activate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate *NH&#8211;NH species. The asymmetric interfacial sites lower the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates, thereby promoting urea photosynthesis. This work provides significant insights into designing interfacial asymmetric sites to facilitate photosynthetic organic chemicals for upgrading the nitrogen cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transient Induction of Chirality from an Activated Carboxylic Acid to a Zinc Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;controlled induction of chirality on a Zn2+ metal complex is achieved by means of an enantiomerically pure activated carboxylic acid (ACA). Such chirality induction is due to the interaction between the Zn2+ cation and the carboxylate group of the ACA conjugate base that acts as a ligand. As the decarboxylation proceeds, the complex becomes racemic again with no enantiomeric/diastereomeric excess of any chemical species present in solution. 








Abstract
Enantiomerically pure activated carboxylic acids (ACAs), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acids, are exploited to program the induction of chirality onto a zinc metal complex over time. NMR analysis shows that binding of the enantiopure ACA conjugate base to the Zn2+ center breaks the symmetry of the complex and induces the formation of a single diastereoisomeric metal complex. Such a diastereoisomer is present only as long as the ACA is found in solution, and the ACA loading determines the time interval in which it persists in solution. At the end of the dissipative ACA cycle, no diastereoisomeric/enantiomeric excess is present anymore in the mixture. For the first time, a coordination process involving an ACA, more precisely its conjugate base, instead of an acid&#8211;base reaction, is exploited to drive a dissipative system.

Mechanochromic mechanophores function as force&#8208;reporting molecules in polymer materials. In their Research Article (e202510114), Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#160;al. demonstrate the first hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on [2.2]paracyclophane. Polyurethane films covalently incorporating the mechanophore exhibit excimer&#8208;dominant emission in the force&#8208;free state. Upon mechanical activation, force&#8208;induced separation of the associated fluorophores leads to a change in fluorescence color from excimer&#8208;dominant bright yellow to monomer&#8208;dominant blue&#8208;green.

         <title>Atorvastatin&#8208;Loaded Mineralized Vaccine Reprograms Endosomal Trafficking to Amplify STING&#8208;Driven Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralized nanovaccine (OVA&#8208;ATV@MnO&#8322;) spatiotemporally co&#8208;delivers and releases tumor antigen, atorvastatin, and Mn adjuvants in dendritic cells. Atorvastatin reprograms endosomal trafficking to delay lysosomal degradation, enhancing antigen cross&#8208;presentation via MHC&#8208;I, while Mn2+ activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying dendritic cell maturation and antitumor T&#8208;cell responses. This dual&#8208;action strategy achieves potent tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable anticancer immunity.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;targeted nanovaccines offer great promise for cancer immunotherapy but are severely limited by premature lysosomal degradation of antigens, which reduces cross&#8208;presentation efficacy. Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA&#8208;ATV@MnO&#8322;) that co&#8208;delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO&#8322; matrix. The ATV&#8208;mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC&#8208;I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO&#8322; framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn2&#8314; ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T&#8208;cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity. By synergistically rewiring intracellular antigen trafficking and amplifying STING&#8208;mediated immune activation, this mineralized vaccine platform provides a transformative strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy.

Ionic liquid&#8208;confined triazine&#8208;COF nanopores in the Z&#8208;scheme COF/BiVO4 nanocomposites serve as efficient nanoreactors for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Its excellent performances stem from the Z&#8208;scheme promoted charge&#8208;separation for increasing electron density in the nanoreactor. Moreover, the nanoconfinement effects enable directed interfacial electron transfer, and enhanced CO2 capture/activation through in situ ionic liquid redistribution.








Abstract
The topological nanopores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show promise as spatially confined nanoreactors for solar CO2 photoconversion. However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro&#8208; and mesoporous triazine&#8208;COFs were in situ grown on amino&#8208;modified BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL&#8208;confined COF mesopore&#8208;nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38&#8208;fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH4 in pure water under UV&#8208;vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z&#8208;scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi&#8208;hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM]+ cations, ii) promoted CO2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM]+ cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>

A novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate additive that can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is developed, which enables kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction, thereby promoting the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface and excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Unconventional Fast Room Temperature Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Single Crystals Unveiling Precise Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a fast, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline, highly fluorinated 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). We achieved the growth of 3&#8208;micron&#8208;long COF rods, enabling the precise study of their mechanical properties and aggregation states. The crystallization process was computationally elucidated, revealing the critical roles of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in promoting Schiff base bond formation and improving COF crystallinity. This study offers new insights into the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs, with implications for their use in a range of advanced materials applications.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a special kind of crystalline polymers produced by the polycondensation reaction of organic linkers. However, the polymerization is often uncontrolled and conventionally yields polycrystalline powders. For that reason, the development of new methods to obtain single&#8208;crystalline COFs is an urgent need. Herein, we report a modulated, room&#8208;temperature, and fast synthesis of a highly fluorinated COF where the reaction conditions were systematically analyzed to yield single&#8208;crystalline rods of around three microns. The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF. This study reveals new insights into the crystallization of high&#8208;quality 2D COFs.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dearomatization of Pyridines and Quinolines Enabled by the Carbodication Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly 1,4&#8208;selective reduction of pyridines and quinolines is described enabled by the carbodication Lewis acid. Most notably, the pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the C2 positions can be selectively reduced for the first time.








Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are valuable compounds in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. The most straightforward pathway for preparing 1,4&#8208;DHPs is the direct 1,4&#8208;reduction of pyridines and quinolines. However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long&#8208;standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with &#8208;CN and &#8208;ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4&#8208;DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4&#8208;DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5&#8208;bromination, C5&#8208;trifluoromethylation, C5&#8208;deuteration, and C4&#8208;deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4&#8208;DHPs as key intermediates.

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction Efficiency Through Improved Interaction Enabled by a Decorated Covalent&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF was prepared and used for the photoreduction of CO2. Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF achieves a CO production rate of 30.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2&#160;h. The small pore size of the host increases the local pressure, reduces diffusion of the adsorbed CO2, shortens the distance for photoelectron transfer, and favors CO2 activation and conversion.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 is often hindered by the sluggish kinetics for its activation. Refinement of host&#8211;guest interactions is an effective strategy to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the immobilization of active Co(II) sites within a covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain structure, Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF, which demonstrates a remarkable CO generation rate of 30.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2&#160;h for CO2 photoreduction at room temperature. The pore size of Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF is comparable to the diameter of CO2, which allows simultaneous interaction of a single CO2 molecule with the two Co(II) sites. The enhanced interaction result in increased local CO2 pressure, limited CO2 diffusion after adsorption, shortened distance for photoelectron transfer, and reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 reduction, promoting CO2 activation and conversion. This work opens a new way to design efficient catalysts by optimizing the pore size of the host.

The small pore size of the host increases the local pressure, reduces diffusion of the adsorbed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, shortens the distance for photoelectron transfer, and favors CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is often hindered by the sluggish kinetics for its activation. Refinement of host&#8211;guest interactions is an effective strategy to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the immobilization of active Co(II) sites within a covalent-organic framework (COF) with a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure, Co-PyPDA-COF, which demonstrates a remarkable CO generation rate of 30.5&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2&#160;h for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction at room temperature. The pore size of Co-PyPDA-COF is comparable to the diameter of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which allows simultaneous interaction of a single CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule with the two Co(II) sites. The enhanced interaction result in increased local CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, limited CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion after adsorption, shortened distance for photoelectron transfer, and reduced energy barrier for the rate-determining step in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and conversion. This work opens a new way to design efficient catalysts by optimizing the pore size of the host.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intercalation Chemistry Awakens Transition Metal Hydroxide for Boosted and Sustained Electrocatalytic Sulfion Oxidation</title>

MoO42&#8722; intercalated Co(OH)2 nanosheet array is engineered for promoted electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation. Combined experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO42&#8722; intercalation can strengthen mass transfer, and impressively, manipulate electronic structure to weaken HS&#8722; and S8 binding, and decrease |&#916;Gs*|, consequently awakening Co(OH)2 for remarkably boosted and sustained SOR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) is a sustainable approach to treat sulfion&#8208;rich sewage for S recovery. Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S&#8208;containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH)2 as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, MoO42&#8722; intercalated Co(OH)2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29&#160;V versus RHE to attain 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a record Tafel slope of 27.7&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and stable operation for 192&#160;h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO42&#8722;&#8208;intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO42&#8722; intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH)2 with downshift of d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS&#8722; and S8, and decreasing the |&#916;Gs*|, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake&#8208;up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Packing Mode Variations and Chirality Inversion in Short Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports subtle pH&#8208;dependent chirality inversions through designed amphiphilic peptides. The underlying mechanism is revealed to be closely related to the protonation state of the hydrophilic His residue. The protonated His promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing and left&#8208;handed fibril assembly, whereas the deprotonated His facilitates parallel packing and right&#8208;handed fibril assembly, driven by interstrand His&#8211;His interactions.








Abstract
Precise control of structures and morphologies in peptide self&#8208;assembly has been challenging. We report the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptides I3H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C&#8208;terminal histidine&#8208;based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self&#8208;assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH&#8208;dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of &#946;&#8208;strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH&#8208;dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I3GH assembly maintaining this effect while I3GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual &#946;&#8208;sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side&#8208;chain interactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer of Ag(II) CF2X Carboxylates: Quantum Yield and Electrophotocatalytic Arene Fluoroalkylation Tuned by X</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylation methods beyond CF3 incorporation are less common but highly desirable. Herein, we leverage Ag(II) ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to achieve catalytic installation of CF2X moieties onto (hetero)arenes directly from abundant fluoroalkyl carboxylates. Furthermore, the isolation of a series of well&#8208;defined Ag(II) CF2X carboxylate compounds allows for the study of how LMCT quantum efficiency is modulated by the X substituent.








Abstract
Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X&#160;=&#160;F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.

A metal&#8208;free ethynylsulfone&#8208;based phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization enables the synthesis of stereoregular poly(&#946;&#8208;aryloxylvinylsulfone)s (PAVSs) with tunable Z/E&#8208;regularity and distinct thermal/mechanical properties. The PAVS platform further supports unique stimulus&#8208;induced transformations, including catalyst&#8208;free degradation, C&#9552;C bond cleavage, and photoinduced fluorescence enhancement, highlighting its potential for advanced smart material applications. 








Abstract
We reported a metal&#8208;free ethynylsulfone&#8208;based phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization for the efficient synthesis of stereoregulated poly(&#946;&#8208;aryloxylvinylsulfone)s (PAVSs), a new class of polymers exhibiting inherent responsiveness to multiple stimuli. This polymerization exhibits superior reactivity, yielding high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers whose stereochemistry (Z/E configuration) can be precisely modulated by catalysts, monomer concentration, and solvents. The resulting Z&#8208; and E&#8208;enriched PAVSs demonstrate distinct thermal and mechanical properties, highlighting the impact of stereochemical control on material performance. Furthermore, new stimulus&#8208;induced transformations have been developed on the PAVS platform. A catalyst&#8208;free amine exchange reaction enables both precise polymer degradation and direct polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion under mild conditions. Moreover, an unprecedented C&#9552;C bond cleavage reaction between PAVSs and N,N'&#8208;diethylethylenediamine affords methylated products, representing a rare example of alkene bond scission via simple diamine treatment. A photoinduced rearrangement reaction has also been established, leading to significant fluorescence enhancement upon UV irradiation. This photochemical behavior underpins potential applications in secure information encoding and encrypted communication.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Featuring Multipathway Charge Transfer for High&#8208;Efficiency BT.2020&#8208;Compliant Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters were developed through the construction of multipathway charge transfer characteristics. OLEDs employing the optimized molecule as the terminal emitter and as a sensitizer exhibit high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, achieving EQEs of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, with corresponding CIE&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.








Abstract
BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are in high demand to achieve a wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we report deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters featuring a unique donor1&#8208;donor2&#8208;acceptor (D1&#8208;D2&#8208;A) molecular configuration in which C1&#8208;N linked carbazole derivatives serve as dual&#8208;function donors and an oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron unit acts as the acceptor. The new design strategy focuses on constructing excited states with multipathway charge transfer characteristics&#8212;including multiresonance, through&#8208;bond, and through&#8208;space charge transfer&#8212;by precisely tuning the relative electron&#8208;donating strengths of the D1 and D2 units. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO&#8208;BTC, achieves a well&#8208;balanced trade&#8208;off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio. Consequently, OLEDs using BO&#8208;BTC as the terminal emitter or as the sensitizer for &#957;&#8208;DABNA achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophenes from Pyridines Using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophenes can be disconnected to pyridines through a novel formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] treatment of Zincke ketones with elemental sulfur. In situ ring&#8208;opening of the &#960;&#8208;deficient heteroarene gives an extended diene, which undergoes simple reaction with octasulfur to give the &#960;&#8208;excessive thiophene.








Abstract
We describe a skeletal editing of pyridines to afford thiophenes through a formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] reaction using elemental sulfur. 2&#8208;Arylpyridines are converted to ring&#8208;opened aza&#8208;triene Zincke ketone structures, followed by simple treatment with sulfur to give 2&#8208;aroylthiophene products directly. The amphiphilic character of octasulfur enables smooth reaction with the Zincke dienamine, affording the cyclized products under mild and neutral conditions. We illustrate this new disconnection with a synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug suprofen from a pyridine starting material.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkyl Displacement of Thioethers for Streamlined Trideuteromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach has been developed for late&#8208;stage direct trideuteromethyl incorporation into thioethers by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source. Mechanistic studies showed that the sulfonium salt generated in situ is the key intermediate. Control experiments revealed that in situ generation of the sulfonium and its subsequent reduction at the cathode is the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.








Abstract
Deuterated compounds exhibit significant pharmacokinetic advantages and have been widely applied in drug discovery. Trideuteromethyl&#8208;containing compounds represent a substantial portion of both approved deuterated drugs and those in development. Traditional approaches to incorporate trideuterated methyl group with trideuterated methyl sources (such as iodomethane&#8208;d3, dimethyl sulfate&#8208;d6) require preactivated synthetic precursor, limiting the application for the late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl group incorporation of pharmaceutical molecules. Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram&#8208;scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in&#8208;situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate. A series of control experiments reveals that alkanes as the departing moiety are the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Release of a Dual Payload from a &#946;&#8208;Lactam Mechanophore with a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane device operates as a logic AND gate to release a single or dual cargo payload upon application of force in the absence or the presence of water, respectively. This concept was demonstrated with the release of a ketene and varied drugs, paving the way for precision release applications.








Abstract
The force&#8208;controlled release of functional molecules has attracted interest due to its potential use in drug delivery and self&#8208;healing applications. Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane&#8208;based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.

The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a &#946;-lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Diffusion&#8208;Reaction Coupling Strategy for CO2 Reduction on Copper Surface in Acidic Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong dipole moment unit, azulene, is used to polarize sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen&#8208;enriched polymer and further enhance CO2 adsorption and transporting on catalytic polycrystalline copper surface. A remarkable Faradaic efficiency of nearly 84% for C2 products has been achieved at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 40&#160;h in acid, reaching the record for CO2 reduction in acidic media.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C2+) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single&#8208;pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong&#8208;polarized layer&#8208;covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp3&#8208;N)&#8208;enriched azulene&#8208;based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO2&#8208;diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84%&#160;C2 Faradaic efficiency at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and demonstrates long&#8208;term stability over 40&#160;h, which is the record for CO2RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene&#8208;polarized sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment can increase the local CO2/H2O ratio at electric double&#8208;layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop&#8208;bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong&#8208;polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO2RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong&#8208;polarized polymers.

         <title>Ligand Type Guided Keto&#8208;Arylation Enables Modular Total Synthesis of Polycyclic CBS Xanthones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand type concept guided a central aromatic keto&#8208;arylation in the first total syntheses of CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100. Davis oxidation with catalytic base and late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the route. This strategy provides modular, concise and high&#8208;yielding access to uncharted polycyclic xanthones. Meanwhile, ligand types emerge as a powerful design tool in sophisticated cross couplings.








Abstract
The first total synthesis of the potent polycyclic xanthone antibiotics CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100 was accomplished by a modular strategy featuring a very demanding intermolecular aromatic keto&#8208;arylation. Central to the solution was a recently&#8208;developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high&#8208;yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Nondestructive Patterning of Upconverting and Down&#8208;Shifting Luminescent Nanoparticles for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the nondestructive patterning of both upconverting and down&#8208;shifting luminescent nanoparticles by rationally designing the chemical structure of a three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G). The 3G&#8208;based patterning method enables the fabrication of arbitrary patterns with high fidelity, high resolution (down to nanoscale), and fully preserved structural and optical properties. The ability of this method to sequentially pattern different luminescent nanoparticles offers a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid&#8208;state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C&#9472;H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2, in stark contrast to 200&#8211;500&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2 for diazirine&#8208;based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G, and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G&#8208;based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;layer structures for dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system&#8208;level devices.

This cover shows how two stimuli, force and water, are necessary to unlock the release of various drugs from a rotaxane molecular device. Mechanical force is used to break a &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophore with the help of a rotaxane actuator illustrated by a pillar[5]arene macrocycle threaded onto a rope. The scission of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring reveals an imine, which is subsequently hydrolysed in the presence of water to unlock the release of drug molecules, as reported by Guillaume De Bo et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202512698).

With great respect for bears, which, in the past, were used to harvest their bile containing ursodeoxycholic acid &#8211; a key building block in this study &#8211; we developed a flexible and unsymmetric coordination ligand L. L reacts with salts of shiny palladium forming helical Pd6L8 and Pd12L16 cages via flexibility&#8208;aided orientational self&#8208;sorting. The cages undergo structural transformations induced by changing reaction conditions and exhibit toxicity in vitro using spheroids of hepatic cells HepG2. Details of the study are reported by Ond&#345;ej Jur&#269;ek et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202513902).

A tetraphenylethylene&#8208;conjugated poly(L&#8208;cysteine) vesicle was engineered to execute a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;to&#8208;&#946;&#8208;turn conformational transformation driven by reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation, as reported by Mingming Ding et&#160;al. (e202503875). The transition boosted fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence, enabling dual&#8208;modal tracking of conformational changes, and mediated a full color&#8208;reportable drug release, allowing efficient imaging and treatment of tumors.

In their Research Article (e202503322), Takanori Iwasaki, Kyoko Nozaki, and Ryo Mandai realized a stable tetraarylborate anion, BBcat, which exhibits strong Lewis acidity. Its Ir complex exhibited high efficiency in the hydrogen isotope exchange of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted arenes by cooperative catalysis of the Ir complex and the Lewis&#8208;acidic sites on BBcat. BBcat and the Ir complex are symbolically associated with mythological Genbu and Suzaku. Genbu, a tortoise entwined with a snake, reflects BBcat's dual nature.

         <title>Electron Spin Resonance at the Single&#8208;Molecule Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides an overview of the four electron&#8208;spin&#8208;resonance techniques with single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, relying on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. After introducing underlying common concepts, it reviews the working principles, experimental conditions and key achievements.








Abstract
Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a widely employed spectroscopic technique for studying systems with unpaired electron spins, such as molecular radicals. Typically, many billions of spins are required to get a detectable ESR signal, which is subject to extensive ensemble averaging. Downscaling ESR to a single molecule allows studying the signatures of each individual molecule separately, applicable to biomolecules in their native environment, for example. Single&#8208;molecule ESR offers several novel research avenues, such as in quantum sensing with a single molecule. Over the last decades, four different single&#8208;molecule ESR approaches have been developed, which rely on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. An introduction into these four approaches including their deployment in pioneering works will be provided.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Molecular Tools in Precise Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted single&#8208;molecule drugs, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs have become important molecular tools in tumor therapy. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in molecular tools for mitochondria&#8208;targeted precision tumor therapy, providing valuable references to facilitate the clinical translation of precision medicine.








Abstract
Precise therapy for tumors faces challenges associated with traditional methods, such as low targeting efficiency, substantial side effects, and drug resistance. As the core regulators of cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, mitochondria exhibit considerable advantages through targeted molecular tools that precisely deliver drugs, interfere with key pathways, and activate immune responses. This article reviews the latest advancements in mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools for precision tumor therapy. Modifying molecular structures or designing functionalized carriers, small molecular drugs, metal complexes, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs can be precisely enriched in mitochondria, disrupting the mitochondrial membrane, interfering with the respiratory chain, or activating immune pathways, thereby significantly enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. However, further optimization of the design of mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools is required, and their synergistic potential with immunotherapy metabolic regulation, and mitochondrial DNA targeting warrants further exploration. The rational design of mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools holds great promise for achieving precise, personalized, and low&#8208;toxicity tumor therapy.

         <title>Radical C&#9472;H&#8208;Aroylation of Allenes via Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and photoredox catalysis for C&#9472;H benzoylation and esterification of allenes is presented. This reaction proceeds through the cross&#8208;coupling of in situ generated ketyl and allyl radicals.








Abstract
This study demonstrates the use of cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis for sp2 C&#9472;H acylation of allenes. The cascade comprises oxidative generation of an allene radical cation from an allene, its nucleophilic trapping to the corresponding allyl radical and highly regioselective cross coupling by a concomitantly reductively generated NHC&#8208;derived ketyl type radical. Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenes can be obtained in good yields through such a cascade. Mechanistic studies&#8212;including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching&#8212;support the proposed mechanism. Moreover, follow&#8208;up chemistry is conducted to demonstrate the synthetic value of the cascade products.

         <title>Engineering Peripheral Metal&#8208;Oxide Catalysis: Interparticle Spacing in Cu/ZrO2 Catalysts for Methanol Synthesis by CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytically active periphery around oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles is key in reactions featuring marked metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. For Cu/ZrO2 CO2 hydrogenation catalysts, a Cu interparticle spacing of &#8764;15&#160;nm optimizes methanol production rate and selectivity. This spacing maximizes the surface density of formate intermediates on peripheral ZrO2 which are dynamically turned over, marking a shift in the reaction's kinetic control.








Abstract
The periphery surrounding oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15&#160;nm. Operando modulation&#8211;excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface&#8208;bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal&#8208;specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroboration of Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers, achieving fourfold regioselectivity (1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;) with high selectivity. This includes the first 4,1&#8208;selective example and expands asymmetric hydroboration to previously inaccessible trisubstituted and oxygen&#8208;substituted dienes.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well&#8208;established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom&#8208;substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac)2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;hydroboration products in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labeling, kinetic, and UV&#8211;vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co&#8211;H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late&#8208;stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Dizygotic Atomic Platinum and Palladium on Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Ethanol and Methanol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been explored to maximize Pt utilization, but they struggle to efficiently activate the C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds in alcohols. Multi&#8208;metallic dizygotic&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), which incorporate multiple metal atoms in dispersed active sites, offer a promising alternative by enhancing catalytic activity through metal synergy. Pt and Pd, with similar electronic properties, can work synergistically in DASCs to improve alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation efficiency. 








Abstract
Dizygotic&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), consisting of multi&#8208;atomic dispersed catalytic centers, perform well in several reactions but have poor electrocatalytic activity toward alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation. In this study, DASCs of atomically dispersed platinum and palladium on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (Pt1Pd1/NCNC) are successfully synthesized using an impregnation&#8211;adsorption method. The Pt1Pd1/NCNC catalyst has higher mass activity toward ethanol and methanol oxidation than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. In contrast, Pt or Pd single&#8208;atom catalysts on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages are virtually inert. Ethanol and methanol on Pt1Pd1/NCNC are electro&#8208;oxidized to acetate ion and CO2 as the final product, respectively. Pt1Pd1/NCNC exhibits long&#8208;term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate. Ab initio simulations show that Pt1Pd1/NCNC optimizes the ethanol oxidation pathway thanks to a lower energy barrier and onset potential than individual single Pt or Pd atom catalysts on NCNC. This study opens a new path to developing advanced DASCs for alcohol oxidation.

Ethanol and methanol on Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/NCNC are electro-oxidized to acetate ion and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the final product, respectively. Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/NCNC exhibits long-term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate. Ab initio simulations show that Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/NCNC optimizes the ethanol oxidation pathway thanks to a lower energy barrier and onset potential than individual single Pt or Pd atom catalysts on NCNC. This study opens a new path to developing advanced DASCs for alcohol oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Individual Virus Detection by Peptide&#8211;Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Assembled Artificial Binder</title>

Developing a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB) platform provides new opportunities for replacing antibodies in the diagnostic field. We demonstrated that PEGNAB, composed of gold nanoclusters and polymeric peptides, can densely bind to the surface of virions, leading to signal amplification. The universal nature of the PEGNAB model was demonstrated by the successful detection of a single influenza A virus.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection is urgently required for viruses with high infectivity and lethality rates. In this study, we developed a direct detection platform, a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB), in which antigen&#8208;binding polymeric peptides are modified on a single gold nanocluster. This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500&#8211;800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1&#8211;100&#160;copies per well. A PEGNAB&#8208;based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity. In a double&#8208;blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrate that different PEGNAB&#8208;based target binding modes can be readily adapted to various pathogens by altering the peptide sequence.

The proposed TCN&#8208;engineered cell strategy enables cell engineering via carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic &#946; cells without the need for chemical modification, while the TiOx quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound&#8208;responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from &#946; cells, which features cell packaging and functionalization through the use of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanocomposites.








Abstract
Engineered cell&#8208;based therapy is an emerging approach for treating intractable diseases, in which the remote control of cellular behavior necessitates robust physical input&#8208;sensing&#8208;response systems. Nanomaterials represent promising tools to enable&#160;wireless remote control of cells. To achieve this, the precise anchoring of nanomaterials to target cells is crucial for nanomaterial&#8208;engineered cells to prevent undesired effects such as endocytosis and diffusion. Herein, we describe a general cell engineering strategy using nanomaterials to achieve remote&#8208;controlled and sustained insulin release from the engineered pancreatic &#946; cells. The prepared nanocomposite, termed TCN, is composed of defect&#8208;rich titanium oxide quantum dots with ultrasound&#8208;electric conversion effect and fibrous carbon substrate. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the TCN enables cell surface engineering through carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic &#946; cells without chemical modification, while the TiOx quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound&#8208;responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from &#946; cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subcutaneous implantation of TCN&#8208;engineered &#946; cell complexes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice enables the restoration of normoglycemia by ultrasound stimulation, establishing a nanomaterials&#8208;enabled controlled cell therapy paradigm for diabetes.

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma Using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modular protein engineering, we generate targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil domain and RGD peptides, we increase micelle size, drug loading capacity, and cancerous uptake. In vivo, TMPA preferentially accumulates in intracranially implanted glioblastoma tumors in mice.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3&#8208;fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution&#8208;phase (short&#8208;phase) half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination&#8208;phase (slow&#8208;phase) half&#8208;life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early&#8208;phase kinetics likely due to tumor&#8208;associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration&#8208;time curve (AUC) in tumor&#8208;bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR&#8208;TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.

         <title>Stable Yet Strongly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Anions Enabling Cooperative Catalysis with Cationic Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable tetraarylborate anion, BBcat, possessing strong Lewis acidity was synthesized. BBcat serves as a weakly coordinating counteranion for the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex, and its Ir complex exhibited up to 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than the common counteranion BArF in the hydrogen isotope exchange of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted arenes by cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex and the Lewis&#8208;acidic counteranion.








Abstract
Ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes play a crucial role as catalysts in organic transformations. Their counteranions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Br&#248;nsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis&#8208;acidic anion, BBcat, based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis&#8208;acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition&#8208;metal catalysis to recognize Lewis&#8208;basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu4N&#8211;BBcat, 31P NMR chemical shift of O&#9552;PEt3 significantly lower&#8208;shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX&#8208;BBcat exhibited an 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX&#8208;BArF consisting of the non&#8208;coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis&#8208;basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis&#8208;basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#9472;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis&#8208;basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal center and the counteranion.

In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, &lt;b&gt;BBcat&lt;/b&gt; resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. &lt;b&gt;Ir/PHOX-BBcat&lt;/b&gt; exhibited an 8.2-fold higher reaction rate than &lt;b&gt;Ir/PHOX-BArF&lt;/b&gt; consisting of the non-coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis-basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis-basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#9472;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of &lt;b&gt;BBcat&lt;/b&gt; with the Lewis-basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition-metal center and the counteranion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycoconjugated Metallohelices Eliminate Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells via Modulating G&#8208;Quadruplex Surrounding Transcriptional Start Site of Sox2 Gene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

Glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) targeted G&#8208;quadruplex surrounding the transcriptional start site of Sox2 gene to eradicate breast cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs) by inhibiting cell viability and stemness.








Abstract
As an important pluripotency transcription factor, Sox2 plays key roles in the stemness maintenance of cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs). Here, we found that a highly conserved G&#8208;rich region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of Sox2 gene can form G&#8208;quadruplex (Sox2G4) both in vitro and in cells. More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) rather than &#923;&#8208;f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that &#916;&#8208;f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes of pluripotency genes can regulate the fates of CSCs. Our work provides a new way to target CSC gene and eradicate cancer stem cells.

         <title>Visual &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;to&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Turn Transition in Luminescent Polymeric Vesicles for Color&#8208;Reporting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#946;&#8208;turn in luminescent poly(L&#8208;cysteine) vesicles. These vesicles not only allow real&#8208;time monitoring of the conformational transition process through changes in fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also exhibit oxidation&#8208;responsive and color&#8208;reporting drug release behaviors for efficient imaging and therapy of tumors in vivo.








Abstract
The secondary structures of polymers significantly influence their properties; however, understanding and modulating polymer conformations remain substantial challenges. Particularly, the &#946;&#8208;turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#946;&#8208;turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual&#8208;modal approach to real&#8208;time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation&#8208;mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Sulfide Separation from Carbon Dioxide Achieved by Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids for Natural Gas Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient separation of H2S from CO2 remains a pivotal challenge in natural gas upgrading. This work pioneers a cascade H2S sorption mechanism enabled by carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids, achieving unprecedented H2S capacity and record&#8208;high H2S/CO2 selectivity, which sets a groundbreaking benchmark for H2S/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H2S from CO2, another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H2S from CH4, the selective removal of H2S from CO2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H2S, departing from conventional acid&#8208;base interaction&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H2S. Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H2S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H2S into [HS]&#8315; species. The unique cascade H2S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H2S, endowing the [6ca]&#8208;derived ILs with unprecedented high H2S capacities and record&#8208;breaking H2S/CO2 selectivities (67&#8211;89 at 1.0&#160;bar and 229&#8211;319 at 0.1&#160;bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy&#8208;efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H2S/CO2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.

         <title>Small Molecule Promoters of Endogenous Lipid Droplet Accumulation Drive Lysophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;fat diets and fatty acids are traditionally used to induce lipid droplet formation in cells and animals. The authors developed a new high&#8208;content imaging platform and identified functionally superior novel small&#8208;molecule lipid droplet inducers. They report the activation of lysophagy, a unique cell death pathway, upon abrupt accumulation of lipid droplets in cancer cells.








Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are central in regulating metabolism in stress&#8208;induced conditions, including one triggered by nutrient deprivation. Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high&#8208;fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule&#8208;based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.

Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to boost alkaline HER activity of Ru via hydroxyl and hydrogen spillover effects activated by the constructed Ru@Mn3O4 heterointerface. Under alkaline condition, water dissociation occurs on Mn3O4 and through spillover processes, OH* and H* migrate to the Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bridge and Ru sites at the interface, respectively. OH* can rapidly desorb from the Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn sites, and H2 is produced from Ru sites.








Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 30&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100&#160;mV in 1.0&#160;M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.

         <title>Directional Depolymerization of Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) with High Monomer Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The directional depolymerization of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) to &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) is achieved in solution through confined catalyst design strategy. The formation of CL&#8208;dimer can be effectively inhibited by the confined pocket formed by the (BisSalen)Al complexes, resulting in a clear boost in monomer selectivity (&gt;99%) and yield (93%), thus to realize the closed&#8208;loop recycling of PCL.








Abstract
Chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the most attractive method for achieving the closed&#8208;loop usage of polymers, in which polymers are recycled back to their starting monomers and then used to produce new polymers without loss of the virgin material properties. However, during the CRM process, the depolymerized products are usually accompanied by the formation of byproducts (e.g., cyclic oligomers) in addition to monomers. Therefore, the directional depolymerization to monomer through catalyst design is significant. Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) to &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (&gt;99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.

         <title>Understanding Optical Properties and Electronic Structures of High&#8208;Entropy Alloyed Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy perovskite (HEP) nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized and their anomalous optical and electronic signatures are characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical measurements, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. Despite the smaller size of HEP NCs than the Bohr diameter of pristine NCs, they possess wider bandgaps and featureless band structures due to the formation of shallow states. In situ luminescence analysis further demonstrates the superior photostability of HEP NCs thin films.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloying (HEA) has emerged as a prominent strategy to modulate physiochemical properties of nanomaterials. Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high&#8208;entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B&#8208;site elements (Pb2+, Sr2&#8314;, Ca2&#8314;, Cd2&#8314;, and Mg2&#8314;). High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr3 NCs (&#8764;7&#160;nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band&#8208;edge shallow states. We show that these HEA&#8208;induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.

         <title>Complex Multistate Photophysics of a Rhodanine Photoswitch</title>

Slow switching. A novel photoswitch is observed by ultrafast experiment to have unusually slow excited state dynamics. The pathway is resolved by quantum chemical calculation.








Abstract
Development of new and improved photoswitches for molecular photonics and photo&#8208;pharmaceutics is an increasingly important research objective. Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck&#8211;Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub&#8208;picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck&#8211;Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate n&#960;* state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright &#960;&#960;* state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Ligation of Four Different Alcohols at One Silicon Center: Methodology Development and Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) was developed as a tetrachlorosilane surrogate for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center to generate fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.








Abstract
While critical and indispensable in diversified areas, organosilicon compounds are not naturally occurring and all rely on chemical synthesis. The de novo synthesis of them via quadruple substitutions of tetrachlorosilane was one of the most straightforward and common practices but confronted over&#8208;substitution challenges for heteroleptic silanes, especially the ones with four different substituents. Although selective and iterative substitutions at silicon have achieved notable achievements, methods for fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes are still lacking. Herein, we established the key dephenylative etherification reaction coupling phenylsilanes and alcohols to alkoxysilanes and then developed triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) as the surrogate to tetrachlorosilane for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamic framework is introduced, based on process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to study A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation in reactions between MAX phases and molten salts. By capturing the effects of salt concentration, competing pathways, and temperature, we explain key experimental trends and provide a transferable approach for predicting 2D material synthesis via molten salt etching.








Abstract
Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to&#160;Ti3AlC2, V2AlC, and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials&#8212;defined here by the Al&#8208;to&#8208;Zn exchange&#8212;of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Cumulene&#8208;Linked Stone&#8208;Wales Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional polymers featuring Stone&#8208;Wales defects and cumulene linkages is demonstrated via thermally and light&#8208;induced reactions on Au(111). STM, nc&#8208;AFM, and Raman spectroscopy, complemented by theory calculations, reveal their chemical structure with a non&#8208;planar geometry, and a distinct electronic bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, underscoring the impact of nonbenzenoid motifs in tuning the properties of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene&#8208;based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well&#8208;known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp2&#8208;hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone&#8208;Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene&#8208;based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional SW&#8208;based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW&#8208;based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene&#8208;bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon&#8208;based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>From Spiropyran to a Circadian&#8208;Responsive Photochromic Supramolecular System for Sustainable Crop Protection: Enhanced Photostability, Biofilm Disintegration, and Foliar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional supramolecular bactericidal material, SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], was fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of the bioactive spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), exhibiting circadian rhythm responsiveness. This smart supramolecular system effectively disrupts Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) biofilms while demonstrating enhanced foliar affinity, thereby offering a promising strategy for combating bacterial plant diseases.








Abstract
Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single&#8208;structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm&#8208;eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV&#8208;induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], a self&#8208;assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day&#8211;night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%). This work establishes a paradigm for developing light&#8208;responsive supramolecular agrochemicals that combine structural dynamism with enhanced functionality, offering sustainable solutions against plant pathogens.

Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) coordination enhanced dual&#8208;functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for both Zn&#8208;ion storage and deposition control in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual&#8208;functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni&#8211;DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni&#8211;DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathodes and Ni&#8211;DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g&#8722;1. These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting aqueous secondary batteries.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Transport in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Through Nanoconfined Triple Phase Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a new paradigm for leveraging CTBP&#8208;COFs to decouple the competing interactions at the catalyst/PFSA&#8208;ionomer interface, effectively mitigating the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups while enhancing oxygen transport. The strategic incorporation of COFs not only improves catalytic utilization but also reduces interfacial resistance, paving the way for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance fuel cells with significantly reduced platinum loading. 








Abstract
In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple&#8208;phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well&#8208;defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple&#8208;phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen&#8208;enriched transport channels. Under low&#8208;platinum loading conditions (&#8722;0.05&#160;mgPt&#160;cm&#8722;2) in a H2&#9472;O2 PEMFC, the COF&#8208;modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.

         <title>Multiaxial Aromatic&#8208;Based Photoferroelectric Induced by Synergistic Intermolecular Interactions for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium)2PbBr4, through synergistic noncovalent interactions between hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. The polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior, demonstrating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics coupling spontaneous polarization and remarkable semiconductor attributes have emerged as promising candidates for self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 (4Br2FBZ = 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Notably, the aromatic cations rotate driven by synergistic molecular interactions to form a T&#8208;shaped stacking architecture, resembling interlocking puzzle pieces. This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48&#160;&#181;C cm&#8722;2 and a high Curie temperature of 408&#160;K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), and exceptional detection stability. Strikingly, the polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits excellent self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior due to its biaxial ferroelectricity, indicating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.

         <title>Discharge Rate&#8208;Driven Li2O2 Growth Exhibits Unconventional Morphology Trends in Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is investigated using a polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte. Contrary to liquid systems, larger Li2O2 particles form at higher discharge rates due to space charge layer effects and heterogeneous interfaces. An optimal discharge rate is identified to balance ORR/OER efficiency, side reactions, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) are known for their enhanced safety, higher electrochemical stability, and improved energy density compared to liquid&#8208;state LOBs. However, the investigation of solid&#8208;state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li2O2) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li2O2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li&#8314; transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte&#8211;cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site&#8208;selective Li2O2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade&#8208;off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge&#8208;driven processes in solid&#8208;state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high&#8208;energy battery systems.

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectrosynthesis platform is devised for electrochemical control of cellular signaling under physiological conditions. The system allows on&#8208;demand, selective generation of signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite (NO2&#8722;) ions using Cu2MoS4&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This approach enables independent, electrochemical modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;sensitive ion channels expressed in genetically engineered cells. 








Abstract
Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3) from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.

         <title>Exposure of Au Atom on Au(111) in Metal Nanoclusters for pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exposed Au atom on Au(111) in Au52 nanoclusters and as&#8208;formed surface/interface environment were constructed by introducing nonaromatic ligand. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed the activation of CO2 and the accelerated protonation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water by the surface/interface modification, leading to pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysis with high activity, selectivity, and durability.








Abstract
The control of surface and interface structures in nanocatalysts is a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic performance, but significant challenges persist in achieving precisely designed active sites or environments on the surface/interface of fully protected metal nanoclusters. In this study, we report the construction of an exposed Au atom on Au(111) and the formation of a unique surface/interface environment on the Au52 cluster via a cyclopentanethiol&#8208;etching strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared adsorption spectroscopy reveal that the exposed Au atom facilitates CO2 activation, while the tailored surface/interface environment promotes the accumulation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, which can be validated by the molecular dynamic simulation, thus enhancing proton transfer and suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the surface/interface&#8208;modified Au52 cluster showcases high activity, selectivity, and durability across pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral, and alkaline) electrolytes, providing new insights for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic level.

         <title>&#8220;Strong Assisting Weak&#8221; Effect for Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Host&#8211;Guest&#8208;Doped Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; was proposed, wherein 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) serves as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest. The host, possessing a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect, is capable of effectively triggering the phosphorescence of the guest that exhibits weak intersystem crossing (ISC). Moreover, the relatively long lifetime of the guest is preserved.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, with long lifetime, large Stokes shift, and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, have great potential in numerous fields. And now, the host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79&#160;s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5&#160;s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long&#8208;lived RTP materials.

         <title>Atomic Metal&#8210;Nonmetal Catalytic Pair Cooperatively Drives Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic Mn&#9472;S catalytic pair for driving efficient enzyme&#8208;like catalysis is reported. Poisoning experiments and theoretical calculations reveal a metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperative mechanism, in which the S site not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn metal center to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also directly participates in the catalytic process by stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximum atom utilization and well&#8208;defined coordination environments are promising alternatives to natural enzymes. However, their catalytic performance in enzymatic reactions is intrinsically restricted by the scaling relations, which impose an inherent trade&#8208;off between substrate adsorption/activation and product desorption. Here we report atomically dispersed manganese&#8210;sulfur (Mn&#9472;S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn&#9472;S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy. This work establishes a paradigm for the rational design of highly efficient artificial enzymes through catalytic pair engineering.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Molecular Wires for Membrane Potential Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully water&#8208;soluble fluorescent rosamine&#8208;based amphiphilic molecular wires were developed for imaging membrane potentials. The performance of the probes was evaluated in single cardiomyocytes, murine pituitary gland, and islets of Langerhans.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;sensitive probes based on donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, whose fluorescence is modulated by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in response to changes in membrane potential, are known as PET molecular wires. PET wires have been widely used in cultured cells; however, their applications in tissue&#8208;level imaging have been hampered by their inadequate aqueous solubility, necessitating pre&#8208;dissolution in organic solvents that potentially can cause toxic effects. Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water&#8208;soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water&#8208;soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose&#8208;stimulated murine islets of Langerhans. The new molecular wires make up a useful addition to the toolkit of optical reporters for membrane potential imaging.

         <title>Harnessing Pyridinic N Vacancy Defect in Microporous Structures to Induce the Pre&#8208;Adsorption of Oxygen and Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study confirms the role of O2 pre&#8208;adsorption on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs, a mechanism previously only predicted by theoretical calculations. The results show that the interaction between O2 molecules and pyridinic N vacancy defects shifts the d&#8208;band center of the central Fe atom away from the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the ORR kinetics.








Abstract
Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen&#8208;doped catalysts (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs). However, overlooking the O2 pre&#8208;adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules results in the d&#8208;band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules on Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Design of Polymeric Semiconductor Nanomotors with Multichannel Sensitive 3D Motion for Microorganism Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

A novel class of light&#8208;driven nanomotors based on polymeric semiconductor phenolic resins achieves precise 3D motion under multiwavelength light, guided by rational molecular design. The enhanced mobility and antimicrobial activity, originating from the high photocatalytic efficiency of phenolic resins, provide an innovative material platform for environmental and biomedical applications.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible&#8208;light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light&#8208;driven nanomotors. Among them, the m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine&#8208;quinoid structure with a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (1.90&#160;eV). These nanomotors feature broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H2O2 concentration, enabling precise control over in&#8208;plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light&#8208;driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.

         <title>Homoleptic and Heteroleptic Polyoxotungstate&#8211;Organic Cages for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heteroleptic polyoxometalate&#8211;organic cages have been constructed and shown to be efficient catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. The construction and transformation between {SiW9Ni4}&#8208;based homoleptic and heteroleptic cages may be rationalized by the analyses of bite angles, which are indicative of cage strains and hence their relative thermodynamic stability.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic cages with polyoxometalate (POM) clusters as nodes are an emerging frontier of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, but they have been limited to homoleptic cages, which are composed of only one type of organic ligands. We show here that, in the construction of POM&#8211;organic cages with Keggin&#8208;type {SiW9Ni4} cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self&#8208;assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel LC, in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (LA or LB), allows the integrative self&#8208;sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM8LA/B4LC4 (3 or 4) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic LC can also alter the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process by acting as a non&#8208;coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM8LD6 (5) to POM8LD5 (6). These octa&#8208;Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production; for 4, in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5&#160;h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Feglymycin Using Umpolung Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A total synthesis of the antiviral feglymycin is described, leveraging enantioselective umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS). The strategic use of UmAS to prepare the aryl glycine&#8208;rich tridecapeptide reduced hazardous amide coupling agents by 50%, and replaced asymmetric synthesis reliant on toxic transition metals by organocatalysis.








Abstract
The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process&#8208;intensive components were simplified to a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea&#183;hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution&#8208;phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.

         <title>Simultaneous Modulation of Mesoporosity and Al Siting for Superior Performance Zeolite Catalyst in Ethylene Dehydroaromatization to Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the construction of hierarchical zeolites with selective removal of &#8764;60% of channel&#8208;located Al, revealing that Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) at channel intersections exhibit a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, 13 times higher than those within the channels. This leads to a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in ethylene conversion turnover frequency (TOF), enhanced aromatic selectivity, and superior stability at 973 K.








Abstract
Porosity and Al siting are key levers for optimizing zeolite catalysts, yet they are often addressed independently due to the lack of effective integrated tuning strategies. Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (ZF) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al&#8208;rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (ZP). Remarkably, &#8764;60% of the framework channels&#8217; Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections&#8217; Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), ZF exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than ZP during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site&#8208;specific 31P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h&#8722;1). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to ZP. These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high&#8208;performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Protein Engineering Enable Efficient, Scalable Production of Teleocidin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we reported a scalable chemoenzymatic platform enabling efficient and divergent synthesis of 13 structurally diverse teleocidin B congeners and derivatives (2&#8211;14). Meanwhile, we validated its industrial scalability through pilot&#8208;scale fermentations, yielding 430&#160;mg indolactam V (2), 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1 (9), and 300&#160;mg of teleocidin derivatives (12, 13, and 14). 








Abstract
Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), a class of bioactive natural products, are highly valued in drug development for their unique pharmacological activities. Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self&#8208;sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. Additionally, we established a dual&#8208;cell factory co&#8208;expressing engineered hMAT2A&#8208;TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430&#160;mg indolactam V, 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1, and 300&#160;mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Carbon Dots&#8208;Induced Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Traps in RHO Zeolite: Mechanistic Insights and Superior Flue Gas Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) were introduced into RHO zeolite to construct hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps, which can selectively capture and condense CO2 to enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity during dynamic separation process and promote the CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Zeolites stand out as promising materials for flue gas separation, however, it poses a significant challenge to conduct pore interior modifications to improve the separation performance. Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps in a small&#8208;pore RHO zeolite by embedding carbon dots (CDs), thereby to regulate pore microenvironment and enhance the separation ability of CO2/N2. The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1H&#8208;1H DQ&#8208;SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO2. As a result, the CDs&#8208;containing zeolite (R&#8208;500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO2 adsorption (90.40 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 298K and 1&#160;bar) and CO2/N2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm3 g&#8722;1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO2/N2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R&#8208;500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO2/N2 separation in flue gas.

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), in which DNAzymes are used to sequence&#8208;specifically nick or cleave superhelical plasmids, with help from assisting single&#8208;stranded DNAs. The DANDA system can be used for PCR&#8208;free site&#8208;directed mutagenesis on plasmids to create mutations on difficult targets such as repetitive sequences.








Abstract
Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Photoregulated Peptidase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule light&#8208;activated peptidase (SLAP) enzyme mimic featuring a glucose&#8208;linked photoswitch&#8208;imidazole triad has been created, where the peptidase activity can be controlled by light by tuning the distance between the basic imidazole residue, the reaction center, and the sugar moiety. The cis&#8208;isomer exhibited a significant increase in catalytic activity compared to its trans&#8208;counterpart.








Abstract
Proteases and peptidases play crucial roles in numerous biological processes. These enzymes bind to protein substrates and hydrolyze peptide bonds, resulting in the cleavage of proteins and peptides into smaller fragments. This study reports on a small&#8208;molecule light activated peptidase (SLAP) enzyme mimic featuring a glucose&#8208;linked photoswitch&#8208;imidazole triad, where peptidase activity can be controlled by light by tuning the distance between the basic imidazole residue, the reaction center, and the sugar moiety, that provides a binding site for the substrate and also takes a role in stabilizing the transition state. The cis isomer exhibited a &#8764;300&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to its inactive trans counterpart with a model amide&#8208;substrate. Catalytic hydrolysis was studied with small molecules, FRET&#8208;based substrates, and large cellular proteins. The light&#8208;controlled peptidase activity opens new possibilities for protein degradation in biological systems.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution From Ultra&#8208;Stable Cu&#8208;Zr/Hf Heterobimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

Crystal engineering and facet engineering were concurrently employed to develop a series of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M'&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for record&#8208;high photocatalytic hydrogen production in pristine MOFs. The high performance and crystal&#8208;facet dependent behaviors were investigated to provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of pristine MOFs for efficient photocatalysis.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting for hydrogen production over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is particularly attractive yet remains a challenge. Here, we report a series of ultra&#8208;stable heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M&#8242;&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for photocatalytic hydrogen production, in which, the Cu(I) species act as the active center, whereas Zr(IV)/Hf(IV) plays an essential role in stabilizing the framework. Uniform MOF crystals with distinct morphologies were obtained, showing a rare crystal facet&#8208;dependent photocatalytic behavior. The octahedral MOF crystals denoted as Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O with the exposure of only {101} and {011} facets exhibit a record&#8208;high hydrogen production rate (49825.71&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among pristine MOF photocatalysts. The exceptional performance of Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O can be primarily attributed to its superior photogenerated carrier transfer ability and abundant active sites exposed on the crystal surface. This study provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of MOFs for highly efficient photocatalysis, highlighting the promising future of pristine MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#949;&#8208;Lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;C Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;C bond activation of non&#8208;activated aminocyclopropanes has been developed. This method not only represents an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy method for chiral &#949;&#8208;lactam synthesis via an enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation process but also set up a new strategy for enantioselective transformation of dialkyl&#8208;substituted transition&#8208;metal intermediates.








Abstract
&#949;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry, but a fully enantioselective synthesis without byproduct formation represents a challenge that has attracted significant research interest. Herein, we report an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic synthesis of chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation of aminocyclopropanes. The catalytic C&#9472;C bond activation enables a directed generation of chiral rhodacyclobutanes that circumvents &#946;&#8208;hydride decomposition. Subsequent enantioselective cycloaddition of the alkene unit and then fragmentation generates chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams. A range of enantioenriched &#949;&#8208;lactams have been obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, which can undergo several stereospecific transformations. Theoretical calculations are performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Photocatalyzed Radical Anellation of Nitroalkanes with Alkenes or Alkynes for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a Cu(II)&#8208;photocatalyzed method that employs commercially available nitroalkanes for the synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazoles from alkenes and alkynes, respectively. Detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that the broad substrate scope, encompassing both activated and unactivated alkenes and alkynes, is attributable to a radical pathway involving &#945;&#8208;nitro alkyl radicals.








Abstract
The visible light&#8208;mediated copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazoles from readily available ethyl nitroacetate or phenyl nitromethane is reported. The developed protocol eliminates the need for substrate preactivation or additives, and offers an extensive scope of activated and unactivated alkenes and alkynes as coupling partners. Key intermediates for this formal [3&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition are &#945;&#8208;nitro radicals generated via photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation of nitronates, contrasting the generation of such radicals via Cu(I)&#8208;photocatalysis by a reductive pathway, which shows a different reaction pattern in the coupling with alkenes.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a Thallium Borohydride Stabilized by Coordination to Bis(diisopropylamino)Cyclopropenylidene (BAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong donor ability of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) helps stabilize the first reported thallium borohydride, [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane). According to density functional theory, its hydride resonance is calculated to exhibit a 3.9 downfield shift due to spin&#8211;orbit (SO) effects from the adjacent Tl center. This SO shift is evidence for Tl(6p)&#8208;H(1s) orbital mixing.








Abstract
Reaction of Tl(OTf) with 2 equiv of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)2(OTf)] (1) in moderate yields. Subsequent reaction of 1 with [K][H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN] ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 (3), also in moderate yield. Complex 3 is the first reported thallium borohydride. We attribute its thermal stability to the strong donor ability of the BAC co&#8208;ligand. Both 1 and 3 exhibit trigonal pyramidal geometries about Tl+ in the solid&#8208;state, indicative of the presence of stereochemically active lone pairs. The hydride environment in 3 is calculated to exhibit a 3.9&#160;ppm downfield shift attributed to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the adjacent Tl center.

&lt;p&gt;The strong donor ability of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) helps stabilize the first reported thallium borohydride, [Tl(BAC)(&#956;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-9-BBN]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9-boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane). According to density functional theory, its hydride resonance is calculated to exhibit a 3.9 downfield shift due to spin&#8211;orbit (SO) effects from the adjacent Tl center. This SO shift is evidence for Tl(6p)-H(1s) orbital mixing.

         <title>Ketenimine Multicomponent Strategy for Multifaceted Amidine Functionalization of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent strategy compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis leverages ketenimines for the direct installation of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine motifs into peptides. This method unlocks a range of on&#8208;resin transformations, including side chain editing, macrocyclization, drug/fluorophore/functional&#8208;scaffold conjugation, and aromatic group insertion, streamlining access to functionally enhanced peptide architectures.








Abstract
The amidine group and its derivatives serve as proteolytically stable bioisosteres of the peptide bond, and their selective incorporation into peptides attributes significant chemical and biological features. This study introduces an efficient synthesis of amidine&#8208;containing peptides by a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;compatible multicomponent reaction (MCR), leveraging ketenimine intermediates that are generated in situ. Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on&#8208;resin synthesis of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug&#8208;peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform. Our results underscore the synthetic versatility and functional applicability of ketenimine&#8208;based MCRs for advanced peptide modification, expanding the chemical space of peptide medicinal chemistry and therapeutics.

         <title>Heterointerface Anchored Ir with Localized Strong Orbital Coupling for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validity of strong anchoring strategies via heterophase homojunction is uncovered in Ir&#8208;supported catalysts. These localized strong anchoring dramatically improves the operational stability through the controlled microscopic bonding enhancement, and the increased micro&#8208;support interaction generated by the heterointerface optimizes the reactivities of key intermediate species, thus promoting efficient and durable water electrolysis.








Abstract
The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface&#8208;engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb&#8208;TiO2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic&#8208;scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir&#9472;Osupport bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity&#8208;stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrOx/m&#8208;Nb&#8208;TiO2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mgIr cm&#8722;2), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72&#160;V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm&#8722;2, coupled with unprecedented durability with &lt;1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.

         <title>A Molecular Staircase Built from Hydrazide&#8208;Linked Pyridines as an Artificial Proton Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide&#8208;bridged pyridine moieties have been used to generate a staircase&#8208;shaped artificial proton channel that exhibits excellent proton transport performance. The proton channel shows an EC&#8325;&#8320; value of 0.33 mol% relative to lipids while demonstrating exceptional selectivity over Na&#8314; and K&#8314; ions, with selectivity values of 90.5 and 160.3, respectively.








Abstract
Artificial proton channels exhibiting high selectivity remain largely unexplored, with only two such systems recently reported. Inspired by the DNA duplex's iconic helical structure, we present here a novel strategy for designing a molecular&#8208;scale staircase configuration. The resulting molecular staircase (MS), predominantly linear in shape, consists of pyridine units linked by hydrazide groups, with backbone rigidity enhanced by intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. This MS incorporates up to five proton&#8208;transporting motifs, demonstrating remarkable efficacy as a proton&#8208;conducting channel within lipid bilayer membranes. Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC50 of 0.31&#160;mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K+, 90.5 for Na+, and 3.5 for Cl&#8315;. These results underscore the potential of the MS and its variants as a highly selective and efficient proton channel, advancing the field of artificial ion transport systems.

         <title>Hinge&#8208;Like Mechanochromic Mechanophores Based on [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophores utilizing [2.2]paracyclophane have been developed. In the force&#8208;free state, the rigid [2.2]paracyclophane forces two luminophores into proximity, leading to excimer&#8208;dominant photoluminescence. Stretching the polyurethane films into which the mechanophores are covalently incorporated results in the structures of the mechanophores changing to more open forms, which leads to monomer&#8208;dominant emission being observed.








Abstract
A hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and two excimer&#8208;forming 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophores is presented. Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue&#8211;green monomer&#8208;dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress&#8211;strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.

The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress&#8211;strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge-like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring a Fast Ion&#8208;Conducting Substrate with Competitive Adsorption for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a Li15Si4/Li3N&#8208;based 3D host enables competitive adsorption at dual&#8208;phase interfaces, dynamically reconstructing the solvation sheath and reducing Li+ desolvation barriers by 33%. The integrated design promotes uniform ion transport, suppresses polarization, and achieves 5000&#160;h symmetric cycling and 107% capacity retention over 2000 cycles in full cells, offering a new strategy for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes.








Abstract
The desolvation behavior of Li+ is widely regarded as primarily governed by the electrolyte composition, while the dynamic decoupling mechanism between the electrode interface and solvation structure has received limited attention. Herein, a competitive adsorption&#8208;driven, fast&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting host was innovatively developed based on the Li15Si4/Li3N microrods. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was revealed for the first time that the dual&#8208;phase interface exhibits competitive adsorption interactions with solvent molecules and anions within the solvation sheath. This unique interfacial interaction triggers dynamic reconstruction of the solvation structure at the interface, significantly reducing the Li+ desolvation barrier by 33%. Benefiting from the integration of these multifunctional advantages, the symmetric cell delivers an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of over 5000 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 with an exceptionally low overpotential of 13 mV. Moreover, the full cell coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes achieves an impressive cycling stability of 2000 cycles at 5 C, with a capacity retention of 107%. This work unveils a substrate&#8208;mediated solvation structure decoupling mechanism, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes with 3D architectures.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer on Cu(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(111) nanosheets enable highly selective electrocatalytic alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) via a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism, bypassing conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways. The catalyst delivers&#160;&gt;&#160;98% selectivity and efficiently removes trace alkyne impurities from alkene feedstocks. Mechanistic studies reveal that planar intermediates and linearly hydrogen&#8208;bonded interfacial water synergistically suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation during PCET&#8208;mediated EASH.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis. However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over&#8208;hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve&#160;&gt;&#160;98% selectivity for electrochemical semi&#8208;hydrogenation of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene to 4&#8208;vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor. The Cu nanosheets can also efficiently remove 1%&#8211;8% alkyne impurities in alkene and exhibit broad substrate scope, stereoselectivity, as well as operational stability. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET&#8208;mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation. Interfacial K+&#8208;structured and linearly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation. Radical scavenging and kinetic isotope effect studies, along with theoretical calculations, corroborate a PCET&#8208;dominated mechanism on Cu(111) surface. This work establishes a PCET&#8208;driven paradigm for selective hydrogenation beyond the conventional HAT pathways.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Offering Zero&#8208;Order Sulfur Redox Kinetics for High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that asymmetric coordination in Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts profoundly alters sulfur redox kinetics. The Ni&#8208;NPG elevates the Ni d&#8208;band center, facilitates bidentate Li2S4 adsorption, and shifts the sulfur redox reaction to zero&#8208;order kinetics, enabling a concurrent conversion pathway. This asymmetric&#8208;coordinated metal center moves the rate&#8208;determining step from the difficult solid&#8208;solid conversion (Li2S2 &#8594; Li2S) to a more favorable liquid&#8208;solid transformation (Li2S4 &#8594; Li2S2), thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Accelerating the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics through electrocatalysis has been regarded as one of the key factors to achieve Li&#8211;S batteries of cell&#8208;level energy densities exceeding 600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Though single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M&#8208;N4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li&#8211;S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric&#8208;coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics&#8212;from first&#8208;order (concentration&#8208;dependent) behavior in the symmetric&#8208;coordinated SACs&#8212;to zero&#8208;order (surface&#8208;saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom&#8208;based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d&#8208;band center, enabling a monodentate&#8208;to&#8208;bidentate Li2S4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate&#8208;limiting step from sluggish solid&#8208;solid transformation (Li2S2 &#8594; Li2S) to a more favorable liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2S4 &#8594; Li2S2), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li&#8211;S cells employing Ni&#8208;NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni&#8208;N3P1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4&#160;C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2&#160;C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables Over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based isomeric Lewis bases are designed to provide dual functionality in perovskite solar cells by enabling deep&#8208;level defects passivation and efficient charge extraction. This synergy reduces interfacial recombination losses, resulting in improved device efficiency and operational stability. Devices incorporating with planar configure molecule show consistent performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols, demonstrating their effectiveness in long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability.

     alt="Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables Over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thio-pyridine-based isomeric Lewis bases are designed to provide dual functionality in perovskite solar cells by enabling deep-level defects passivation and efficient charge extraction. This synergy reduces interfacial recombination losses, resulting in improved device efficiency and operational stability. Devices incorporating with planar configure molecule show consistent performance under ISOS-L-2 protocols, demonstrating their effectiveness in long-term applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-thiosumanene-functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep-level defects (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration-functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep-level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT-modified n-i-p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS-L-2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial-related issues for high-performance PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Driven Efficient Ammonia Synthesis by Facilitating *NOOH Formation and Balancing *H Supply</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pulsed electrocatalysis, a Janus Cu@Co/NC catalyst achieves highly efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply. Specifically, the Cu sites can activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites can facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction emerges as a promising approach for ammonia generation; however, its efficiency is hindered by the sluggish hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates and limited active hydrogen supply at constant applied potentials. Driven by the pulsed electrocatalysis, in this work, efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion is realized by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply on a Janus Cu@Co/NC electrocatalyst. In detail, the Cu sites could activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites could facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials. Promoted by the pulsed electrocatalysis technique, a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 98.32% with NH3 yield rate of 12.75 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 is attained, and the scaled&#8208;up pulsed electrosynthesis at industrial current densities is also achieved. This work underlines the feasibility of pulsed electrolysis for regulating intermediate hydrogenation, offering a promising approach for the synthesis of ammonia or other important chemicals.

         <title>Surface Engineered 2D&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine Covalent Organic Framework for Superior Dechlorination via Hybrid Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the escalating global water shortage, hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) offers a cost&#8208;effective desalination approach dependent on advanced electrode materials. We developed a redox&#8208;active COF&#8208;based anode that achieved exceptional chloride removal (up to 89&#160;mg g&#8722;1) with high selectivity, stability, and the highest reported performance for COF&#8208;based HCDI systems.








Abstract
To prevent a global water shortage crisis, we must innovate to desalinate seawater. Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy&#8208;efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl&#8722;), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na+ capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based redox&#8208;active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl&#8208;RC) of 71.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 1300&#160;ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl&#8722; RCR) of 1.85&#160;mg g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl&#8722; over other anions present in real&#8208;seawater samples with Cl&#8208;RC of 89&#160;mg g&#8722;1, implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Dissolution Relay for Deep Progression of Active Sites Toward Efficient and Ultralong&#8208;Life Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering competitive bonding in the medium&#8208;entropy NiCoCu hydroxides, we provide theoretical and experimental understandings of how the Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay happens for initiating deep activation of the active network. The resulting ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) &#947;&#8208;oxyhydroxide nanodomains enable in situ &#8220;self&#8208;rescue&#8221; of reactivity, demonstrating a considerable capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 after 150&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides serve as efficient aqueous cathode materials but suffer from the challenge of structure degradation during long&#8208;term cycling applications. Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100&#160;000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p&#8208;band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As&#8208;incorporated Co vacancies favor the &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;&#947; phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 was achieved after 150&#160;000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiCo&#8208;based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Biohybrid Polymer Networks Using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical method is developed to transform raw biomass, such as whole&#8208;cell algae,&#160;into strong and ductile plastics by combining it with synthetic components. These biohybrid materials can be adapted, remolded, or depolymerized over multiple cycles due to the underlying dynamic covalent polymer network.








Abstract
Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust biohybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole-plant biomass from non-agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole-cell spirulina, a green-blue algae, into robust biohybrid algae-polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae-based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all-synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Restructured Three&#8208;Coordinated Ni&#9472;Se Catalytic Sites for Enhanced Cross&#8208;Condensation of Methanol and Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;doping reconstructs the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites that effectively catalyze MeOH and EtOH conversion to aldehyde intermediates while suppressing further decomposition, thus significantly promoting their cross&#8208;condensation to C5+ higher alcohols.








Abstract
The cross&#8208;condensation of methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) offers a promising, carbon&#8208;neutral pathway for the production of higher alcohols (HAS) from both CO2 and biomass resources. However, this process is often hampered by the low efficiency of C5+ alcohol (C5+OH) synthesis, high catalyst production costs, and limited water tolerance. Here, we report for the first time a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C5+OH) in the cross&#8208;condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross&#8208;condensation to C5+OH.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Enantioselective Olefin&#8211;Aldehyde Cross&#8208;Couplings Toward Acyloin Isosteres</title>

         <dc:description>
Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with 3D motifs (oxetanes/azetidines) unlocks novel chemical space with enhanced pharmacokinetics. Asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters near these strained 3D frameworks remains underdeveloped. Here, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling of aldehydes/heterocyclic alkenes delivering &#945;&#8208;hydroxy bioisosteres was reported, which enables broad tolerance and offers a platform for stereodefined bioisosteres.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motifs, such as oxetanes and azetidines, has emerged as a powerful tool in molecular design, enabling access to novel chemical space with improved pharmacokinetic profiles. However, general methods for the asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters adjacent to these strained, 3D frameworks remain scarce. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aldehydes and four&#8208;membered heterocyclic alkenes to construct &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones bioisosteres with high efficiency and selectivity. Guided by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, the reaction proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, affording enantioenriched products in yields of up to 94% and an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of 99.8:0.2. The protocol is particularly amenable to the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy difluoromethylene alkanes. Mechanistic investigations revealed how strain&#8208;enabled reactivity and ligand control govern chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale preparation and diverse downstream derivatizations, offering a versatile platform for accessing previously elusive classes of stereodefined bioisosteres.

Abstract
Chiral aldehyde catalysis has emerged as an efficient and step&#8208;economical protocol for constructing unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and related esters. Herein, we report the application of a half&#8208;sandwich chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium complex featuring an aldehyde group as a versatile asymmetric catalyst with remarkably broad scope. Direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H functionalization of N&#8208;unprotected glycine esters with four types of electrophiles (51 examples, all&#160;&gt;91% ee) has been successfully realized for accessing structurally diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and successful catalyst recovery underscored the practicability and application potential of the present asymmetric aldehyde catalysis.

         <title>A Bambusuril Receptor Binds Charge Diffuse Anions in Water at Picomolar Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a bambusuril macrocycle with unprecedented binding affinity for several charge diffuse anions, including iodide, perchlorate, nitrate, and perrhenate, in neutral phosphate buffer is reported. The macrocycle exhibits selectivity for charge diffuse over charge dense anions exceeding seven orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Anionic pollutants are widespread in the environment and pose risks to human health. Due to the typically low concentrations of these species, the development of efficient receptors for their detection and removal from aqueous solutions is highly desirable. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a bambusuril receptor with markedly enhanced anion&#8208;binding affinity in water, achieved by introducing trifluoromethyl electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The resulting fluorinated receptor is, to date, the most potent known receptor for several charge diffuse anions in aqueous media. The most stable 1:1 host&#8211;guest complex in water was observed with iodide, exhibiting a relative dissociation constant of 59&#160;pM. This complex is over three orders of magnitude more stable than any previously reported complex between an artificial receptor and inorganic anion in water.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Stable Porous Organic Salts via Suppressed Proton Integration Using Fluorinated Tetrazole Tectons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts featuring hydrophobic channels and minimal hydrogen bonding were constructed using a fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra&#8208;substituted imidazole precursor lacking active protons as the base. These materials exhibited exceptional robustness and structural integrity under both aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions, maintaining their stacking mode and crystal structure even at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid&#8211;base neutralization (e.g., &#9472;SO&#8323;H and &#9472;NH&#8322;) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water&#8208;lean environments.

     alt="Constructing Water-Stable Porous Organic Salts via Suppressed Proton Integration Using Fluorinated Tetrazole Tectons"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous organic salts featuring hydrophobic channels and minimal hydrogen bonding were constructed using a fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor lacking active protons as the base. These materials exhibited exceptional robustness and structural integrity under both aqueous and water-lean conditions, maintaining their stacking mode and crystal structure even at elevated temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid&#8211;base neutralization (e.g., &#9472;SO&#8323;H and &#9472;NH&#8322;) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water-lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single-crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation&#8211;anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water-lean conditions is confirmed by X-ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C&#8211;F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites.

         <title>Structural Insights Into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we found that O vacancies play a critical role in governing the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition during the synthesis process of sodium layered cathode materials. These structural insights broaden synthesis strategies and enhance practical feasibility. As a result of the expanded Mn redox range and the stabilization of oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the synthesized P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrates prominent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performances of layered cathodes&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P&#8242;2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over &#8764;40&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C, maintaining &#8764;93&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P&#8242;2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.

         <title>Electron/Proton Transport Engineering in Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COF, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, integrates benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups to enhance the electron donor&#8208;acceptor effect, optimize light absorption and O2/H2O adsorption, and particularly improve proton transfer. This synergy boosts charge separation and surface reactions, achieving record high H2O2 production of 10.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.12%.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a vital industrial chemical extensively utilized in textiles, pharmaceuticals, and disinfection. Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O2 reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H2O2 synthesis from O2 and/or H2O, offering a low&#8208;energy and simple&#8208;operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone&#8208;linked 2D COF, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, was prepared from benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b':5,6&#8208;b'']trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor&#8208;acceptor effect in COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, optimizes the light&#8208;harvesting and adsorption capacities to O2 and H2O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH achieves an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 10.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H2O2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next&#8208;generation photocatalysts.

TOC: First demonstration of an electroresponsive multistable switch in a supramolecular circuit showing three distinct conductance states under bias voltages without chemical additives, enabling richer logic encoding, achieving an exceptional switching ratio of approximately 1.25&#215;103 (one of the highest reported to date), and revealing the mechanism for the formation of molecular trimer junctions promoted by the applied electrical field.








Abstract
Efficiently manipulating charge transport at the molecular level is critical to developing multifunctional and responsive molecular electronic devices. Here, we report the first electroresponsive tristate switch in a supramolecular circuit, overcoming the binary limitation and enabling richer logic encoding, governed solely by a bias voltage (electric field). At low electric fields, p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high&#8208;conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low&#8208;conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio GH/GL of &#8764;1.25&#215;103, which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio. These findings provide new insights into the design of molecular circuits with tunable conductance, paving a way for the design of molecular computation, memory devices, and sensors.

Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable plastic recycling. This study systematically elucidates the catalytic pathway of PET biodegradation, from enzyme adsorption and substrate recognition to ester bond cleavage. A rational enzyme design principle is proposed to balance catalytic activity and stability, providing guidelines for developing efficient plastic&#8208;degrading biocatalysts.








Abstract
Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has garnered considerable interest in plastic recycling efforts. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase&#8208;catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid&#8208;liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET&#8208;binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.

         <title>Unraveling the Mode of Action of a Neuron&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe, NeuO: Intracellular Phosphorylation Through PAK6 Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NeuO, a small molecule fluorescent probe, selectively stains live neurons across species. Despite wide use and commercial availability, its neuron&#8208;specific mechanism has remained elusive. This work shows that NeuO is phosphorylated intracellularly by the kinase PAK6. This phosphorylation enhances fluorescence and probe accumulation in neurons.








Abstract
NeuO is an intriguing molecular probe capable of selectively labeling live neurons within a heterogeneous population of brain cells. The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkoxylation of Alkynylnitriles to Access (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;Alkoxyvinylnitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, we present the first example of manganese&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydroalkoxylation of alkynylnitriles, accessing both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkoxyvinylnitriles from the same set of starting materials. This method features high functional group tolerance and outstanding chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity, highlighting the potential of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in the selective functionalization of unsaturated compounds.








Abstract
Precise stereocontrol over functionalized alkenes remains a central challenge in organic synthesis. In particular, catalytic methods enabling flexible and stereodivergent synthesis of both trans&#8208;selective and cis&#8208;selective useful enol ethers are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, ligand&#8208;controlled hydroalkoxylation of alkynylnitriles with alcohols under mild conditions. Through metal&#8211;ligand cooperation, a range of (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkoxyvinylnitriles were obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity by simply tuning the steric properties of PNP&#8208;pincer ligands: bulkier tBuPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst favored Z&#8208;selectivity, while less hindered iPrPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst led to E&#8208;selectivity. This method features a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance and exceptional chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Z&#8208;products are initially formed in both cases, with the iPrPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst further promoting isomerization to the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;isomers.

         <title>Ordered Copper Triangular Atomic Sites for Industrial&#8208;Grade Electromethanation of CO2 via Self&#8208;Regulated Adsorption of Reactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered copper triangular atomic site motifs loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI) were synthesized via a precise ion exchange strategy. Cu TAS/PHI enables enhanced CO2 coverage and activation with balanced proton supply through self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, as well as unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, achieving an FECH4 of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an FECD4 of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown considerable potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methane but face constraints of low selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities (&gt;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and limited economic viability. Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;60% across 100&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, it enables CO2 deuteration to high&#8208;value methane&#8208;d4 with an FE of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an estimated annual return on investment of 425.35%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as balanced proton supply via self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO2RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO2RR at industrial&#8208;grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce high&#8208;value deuterated chemicals.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Neopentyl Sodium: A Hydrocarbon&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Controlled Sodiation of Non&#8208;Activated Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Displaying strong controlled metalating power, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble sodium neopentyl can deprotonate challenging non&#8208;activated arenes and alkenes, with sodiated intermediates successfully undergoing onward functionalisation reactions. By characterising key reaction intermediates, and running computational studies on models, insight has been gained on the structure, bonding, and special reactivity of this promising new reagent.








Abstract
While recent studies have shown that organosodium reagents can offer excellent promise in organic synthesis, their widespread applications can be hindered by their limited solubility in organic solvents, lack of stability, and uncontrolled reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Displaying strong controlled metalating power, hydrocarbon-soluble sodium neopentyl can deprotonate challenging non-activated arenes and alkenes, with sodiated intermediates successfully undergoing onward functionalisation reactions. By characterising key reaction intermediates, and running computational studies on models, insight has been gained on the structure, bonding, and special reactivity of this promising new reagent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recent studies have shown that organosodium reagents can offer excellent promise in organic synthesis, their widespread applications can be hindered by their limited solubility in organic solvents, lack of stability, and uncontrolled reactivity. Improving this immature area, here we report the structure of unsolvated neopentyl sodium, which exhibits a unique discrete tetrameric motif and good solubility in hexane. Combining spectroscopic and crystallographic studies with computational bonding analysis, key insights into its constitution and stability have been gained. Expanding its synthetic potential, supporting neopentyl sodium with Lewis donor PMDETA (&lt;i&gt;N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&lt;/i&gt;-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) allows for the direct metalation of challenging non-activated arenes and alkenes, including the regioselective &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-functionalisation of selected 1,3-disubstituted alkyl arenes. Shedding light on sodium-mediated metalation protocols, key organometallic intermediates have been isolated and structurally defined, which can subsequently be intercepted with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or a boron electrophile to be directly used in Pd-catalysed Suzuki cross coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials for Amplification and Dynamic Modulation of Chiral Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral bimetallic cluster aggregates were synthesized using a simple methodology. The introduction of both chiral and achiral additives during synthesis resulted in reversed and amplified chiroptical responses, along with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission. A remarkably high absorption and emission dissymmetry factor of (&#177;)0.05 was achieved, opening newer avenues in the field.








Abstract
Chiral metal clusters have garnered significant research interest in recent years due to their unique photophysical and chiroptical properties. Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)&#8211;silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster&#8208;assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology&#8208;dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (&#177;)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited&#8208;state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light&#8208;emitting materials.

         <title>In Situ Sulfur Modification Enables Electrochemical Selective Deuterated Thiol&#8211;Yne Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An&#160;in situ&#160;sulfur modification strategy is reported to convert a commercial NF cathode into a NiSx&#8208;modified electrode through lattice infiltration of electrochemically generated S2&#8315;. The in situ formed electrode enables the electrochemical deuterothiolation of alkynes with disulfides (RSSR) and D2O, affording D&#8208;labeled vinyl sulfides with up to 98% alkene selectivity and 99% deuterated ratios. The RSSR serves a dual purpose by supplying RS&#8315; and S2&#8315; simultaneously.








Abstract
The deuterated thiol&#8211;yne reaction using D2O represents an attractive strategy for simultaneously introducing pharmaceutically relevant C(sp2)&#9472;D bonds and vinyl sulfide motifs. However, achieving high deuterium (D) incorporation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report an electrochemical deuterated thiol&#8211;yne reaction that delivers D&#8208;containing vinyl sulfides with up to 98% alkene selectivity and 99% D incorporation, employing disulfides (RSSR) and D&#8322;O over an&#160;in situ&#160;sulfur&#8208;modified nickel foam (NF) electrode. Mechanistic studies reveal a reductive cleavage of RSSR to RS&#8315; intermediates, which subsequently form surface nickel sulfide (NiSx) species through R&#9472;S bond cleavage. In situ&#160;and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterizations confirm the NiSx formation and its role in reducing alkene adsorption, thereby suppressing its overreduction. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability across terminal and internal alkynes, as well as aromatic and aliphatic disulfides, furnishing 30 diverse examples of D&#8208;labeled vinyl sulfides.

         <title>Fully Exposed Silver Clusters Enabling Highly Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed silver clusters were successfully anchored on poly(heptazinimide), demonstrating exceptional photocatalytic activity toward H2O2 generation in pure water from O2. Systematic evaluation revealed that it also exhibited significantly enhanced performance compared to their single&#8208;atom counterpart due to superior electronic properties and synergetic effect between adjacent Ag atoms.








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of H2O2 in pure water holds great potential for sustainable industry. However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H2O2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent&#8208;reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron&#8208;rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H2O2. Interestingly, its Ag single&#8208;atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H2O2 into &#183;OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H Coupling of Arylacetamides and Sulfoxides: An Interrupted Pummerer/[2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic Rearrangement Sequence</title>

A two&#8208;step formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts and provides an alternative to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation. The protocol is showcased in a short synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator.








Abstract
Arylacetamides are important structural motifs found in many bioactive compound classes. Given their significance, the selective decoration of arylacetamides by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has attracted considerable attention. Here, we report a two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides that proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts; the amide motif &#8220;catches&#8221; the sulfoxide partner prior to its delivery to the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic ring by rearrangement of a sulfur ylide intermediate. The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations. This protocol has allowed the synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator without recourse to the use of transition metals.

         <title>Chemically Cross&#8208;Linked Polybenzimidazole Membranes with Ion&#8208;Conductive Sub&#8208;Nanometer Channels for Zinc&#8211;Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we constructed cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole (CL&#8208;PBI) membranes with charged sub&#8208;nanochannels via in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. Guided by &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism associated with steric effects and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions, the as&#8208;prepared CL&#8208;PBI membranes enable fast and selective ion transport under confinement through the precise control of channel size and channel chemistry.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer micropores are essential in various separation processes and energy&#8208;related devices. However, the absence of molecular&#8208;level insights into ion transport behavior in sub&#8208;nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom&#8208;scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub&#8208;nanometer channels. Based on &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion&#8211;pore wall interactions facilitate low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc&#8211;iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next&#8208;generation ion&#8208;selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Diboration of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective diboration of dihydropyridines is described that provides an inroad for the construction of substituted piperidine motifs. Insight into the reaction mechanism was gained by DFT experiments, and the reaction products were applied in the construction of relevant heterocyclic intermediates.








Abstract
Dihydropyridines undergo enantioselective 1,4&#8208;diboration in the presence of a chiral Pt&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting diboryl piperidines can undergo diverse stereospecific cross&#8208;couplings, allowing the construction of an array of different substituted chiral piperidines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into a plausible diboration pathway that involves a platinum&#8208;centered reaction between coordinated B2L2 reagent and the diene to furnish an intermediate &#960;&#8211;allyl platinum complex.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Ion Transport Homogenization in 3D Hierarchical MOF for Ultrastable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical pore channels of MIL&#8208;100 confine LiI to form a conductive ionic network, while its triple&#8208;level cross&#8208;linked multi&#8208;stage porous restricts TFSI&#8315; anion mobility, enabling rapid Li&#8314; transport and uniform deposition by optimizing ion flux and suppressing space charge effects.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion&#8208;transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL&#8208;100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF&#8208;HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm) of MIL&#8208;100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size&#8208;selective sieving but also enable continuous Li&#8314; transport through tunable host&#8211;guest interactions between the Lewis&#8208;acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI&#8208;embedded composite (E&#8208;LiI) exhibits a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.88 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li&#8314; plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen&#8208;dependent desolvation energetics and Li+ transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E&#8208;LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention &#8764;100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi&#8208;scale ion&#8208;conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery systems.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent interaction between La and Bi atoms in the intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;block cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;, similar to but larger than that in XeF2, is revealed based on quantum chemistry and valence band X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy.








Abstract
Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#9472;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8211;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.

         <title>The Design of Interfacial Organic&#8208;Riched Phase by Molecular Interlocking for Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode surface by introducing sodium anthraquinone&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) into electrolyte. The zincophilic &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anode. Simultaneously, low&#8208;polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone groups are emerged on the top surface of the AQS layer, attracting more AQS and EG molecules by the molecular interlocking effect to construct the ORP layer. This ORP layer will effectively inhibit the side reactions on Zn anodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic&#8208;riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low&#8208;polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H2O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG&#8208;riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H2O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V2O5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Artificial Seawater Electrolyte Catalyzed by Strong&#8208;Acid/Base&#8208;Resistant MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF with strong acid/base resistance can be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale preparation with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g&#8722;1 and enables highly efficient CO2 electroreduction using artificial seawater electrolyte. This work addresses a critical challenge of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts for sustainable energy applications.








Abstract
NaCl, a primary component of seawater, is a cost&#8208;effective alternative electrolyte for CO2 electroreduction; however, suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge for efficient CO2RR. Herein, a novel Zn&#8208;MOF {[Zn5(tz)6(HCOO)4]&#183;2H2O}n (1, Htz&#160;=&#160;1,2,3&#8208;triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5&#160;M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. 1 could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9&#160;M HCl and 2&#160;M NaOH solutions. 1 achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 94.4% under &#8722;1.5&#160;V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FECO in treated natural seawater under &#8722;0.8&#160;V, maintaining performance over 20&#160;h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H2O in [Na(H2O)5]+ to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405&#160;g&#8722;1, showing promising industrial potential in CO2RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engineered Sub&#8208;10 nm Surface Fluorination Enables Ultraselective Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface fluorination of PDMS&#8208;coated hollow fiber membranes via CF4 plasma engineering achieves sub&#8208;10&#160;nm nanoscale modification, simultaneously enhancing chain rigidity and narrowing pore size distribution. The optimized membrane demonstrates record gas separation performance with industrial&#8208;scale stability, surpassing the 2019 perfluoropolymer upper bounds and conventional polymeric hollow fiber membranes.








Abstract
While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance&#8208;selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) plasma to engineer a sub&#8208;10&#160;nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)&#8208;coated Matrimid&#174; HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3&#8208;fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine&#8208;induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra&#8208;micropore filling. The optimized HFM&#8208;50W&#8208;65Pa&#8208;500s membrane exhibits record&#8208;breaking He/N2 and He/CH4 selectivities of 1202 &#177; 13 and 1790 &#177; 12 with 170 &#177; 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (&#945;(He/CO2) = 56 &#177; 2.2, &#945;(He/H2) = 4.1 &#177; 0.2) for pure&#8208;gas and attractive ternary He/(CO2+CH4) selectivity of 1005 &#177; 20 under 40&#8208;bar mixed&#8208;gas conditions while maintaining 720&#8208;h operational stability. This plasma&#8208;engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Hydrofluorination of Alkynes at Room Temperature Promoted by a Fluoride Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an air and moisture tolerant platinum&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination system that gives selectively (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Experimental and computational investigation on the mechanism allowed for the identification of catalytic species. The hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF, resulting into BF3, PF5 and HF serving as fluoride shuttles.








Abstract
Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic &#223;&#8208;fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF3, HF as well as PF5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer&#8208;sphere fluorination of the metal&#8208;bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.

         <title>Feedstock&#8208;Derived Thiophene Radical Anions Exhibiting Redox Stability at Extreme Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although organic redox systems are emerging as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, stability at high cell voltage is often achieved at the expense of synthetic accessibility. Here, we isolate and characterize a feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anion bearing simple ester groups. Despite a minimalist design, the radical and its derivatives are stable at extreme potentials, enabling their use as readily accessible electrolytes for electron storage.








Abstract
Organic radicals that are both readily synthesized from commodity chemicals and stable at extreme redox potentials are rare, yet highly desirable for applications in energy storage and organic electronics. Herein, we report feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anions bearing ester functionalities that undergo galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge redox cycling at potentials below &#8722;2&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+ (Fc&#160;=&#160;ferrocene). Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low&#8208;cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced &#8220;quinoidal&#8221; thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.

         <title>Chloromethoxytrityls: Tuning the SOMO Level of Stable Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use chlorine and methoxy groups to control the singly occupied molecular orbital level of triarylmethyl radicals within a wide range of 1.8&#160;eV and establish structure&#8208;properties relationships between the substituents and photophysical properties of triarylmethyl radicals.








Abstract
Luminescent radicals are of significant recent interest because of the unique quantum properties of the doublet excited state. Control of the energy level of the singly&#8208;occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open&#8208;shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron&#8208;poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of &#8211;5.7 to &#8211;3.9&#160;eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one&#8208;electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO &#8804; &#8208;4.5&#160;eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled&#8208;cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open&#8208;shell species.

         <title>General Base&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction via Electrophilic Substitution Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is an indispensable tool for carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Here, a base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction was explored and enabled by a conceptually different electrophilic substitution transmetalation mechanism, supported by theoretical and experimental studies. The generality and efficacy of this method were exemplified by broad substrate scope and pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMC) reaction of organoboron nucleophiles with aryl (pseudo)halide electrophiles is a reliable method for carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. This reaction generally requires the use of an exogenous base to promote transmetalation process, which limits the substrate scope of the reaction due to undesired protodeboronation and functional group incompatibilities. Here, we established a base&#8208;free SMC reaction via a conceptually different electrophilic substitution transmetalation (EST). This transformation is applicable to a wide range of base&#8208;sensitive and sterically hindered organoborons. Key to this advance is the formation of a stable cationic palladium(II) or nickel(II) intermediate via experimental and theoretical investigations. In a broader context, this research further expands the synthetic boundary of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry.

         <title>Monodisperse Regulation of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Via Dipole Molecules for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong dipole molecules are employed to regulate the monodispersity of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) micelles and coverage distribution of the resulting SAM films, achieving an efficiency of 26.58%.








Abstract
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly drives the enhancement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460&#160;nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160&#160;nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (aperture area of 14.40&#160;cm2) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T90 of 11,259&#160;h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 condition. This work highlights the great potential of SAMs micelle regulation for achieving efficient and stable PSC.

         <title>Recyclable Side&#8208;Chain Azobenzene&#8208;Based Semicrystalline Polymer Films with Outstanding Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity and Photoresponsive Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond network along the polymer chain through reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, side&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and easy recyclability/reprocessability were developed.








Abstract
Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity (&#955;) of 0.1&#8764;0.5&#160;W/(m&#183;K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and easy recyclability/reprocessability were developed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;) of 0.1&#8764;0.5&#160;W/(m&#183;K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high-power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring &#8220;high-efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low-resistance interfacial connections&#8221; was constructed.

Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain-boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous-crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency.

         <title>Functionalized Calix[4]Nanocones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present a synthesis of a nanocone based on a calix[4]arene, which has additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Due to its rigid structure in combination with alkoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution. It exhibits high selectivity for binding Na+ over Li+ and also K+ in CDCl3.








Abstract
The interest in synthesizing conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) and nanocones has increased recently. Although a number of various structures have been achieved, almost none have additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Based on a calix[4]arene, a functionalized calix[4]nanocone was synthesized. Due to its rigid structure in combination with methoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution by NMR measurements. The nanocone shows a high selectivity for binding Na+ in favor of Li+ and K+ in CDCl3. By comparing the nanocone with a related but structurally flexible methoxy calix[4]arene, the impact of structural rigidity on selectivity is clearly demonstrated.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Stable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Efficient Hexafluoroethane Purification</title>

Efficient C2F6 purification from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture is realized by a stable and easily scalably&#8208;synthesized hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with matching electrostatic potentials and appropriate pore sizes.








Abstract
Developing stable, efficient and easily scalably&#8208;synthesized adsorbents for removal of hydrofluoroethanes to obtain high purity hexafluoroethane (C2F6) is of great importance to the electronics industry. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TDBB) which exhibits statically as well as dynamically preferential hydrofluoroethanes (CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2) adsorption and achieves efficient one&#8208;step C2F6 purification from CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture. At 298&#160;K, 11.7&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 of high&#8208;purity C2F6 can be obtained by HOF&#8208;TDBB from 5/5/90 CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture. Additionally, excellent stability endows HOF&#8208;TDBB with good separation ability under various harsh conditions. For example, the separation performance can be well maintained within the dozens of consecutive separation experiments. Even at 338&#160;K, 5.7&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 of pure C2F6 can also be collected. More importantly, this material can be rapidly synthesized with a large scale by simple rotary evaporation. Combined with excellent separation performance, high stability and scalable synthesis, HOF&#8208;TDBB has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Catalytic Dearomative Coupling of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dearomative dimerization of N&#8208;heteroarenes has been developed to construct pyridine&#8208;fused bridged polycyclic scaffolds via an intertwined EnT/SET pathway. By the regulation of additives, the catalytic dearomative cross&#8208;coupling of two different quinolines has also been realized.








Abstract
Naturally occurring dimeric products have attracted considerable attention from both chemists and pharmacologists. The construction of pseudo&#8208;dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N&#8208;heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo&#8208;dimers of N&#8208;heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.

         <title>Flexibility&#8208;Aided Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting and Transformations of Bioactive Homochiral Cuboctahedron Pd12L16</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking concave morphologies found in nature, we have introduced flexible, unsymmetric, tridentate ligand (L) which undergoes coordination self&#8208;assembly into highly organized chiral Pd6L8 or Pd12L16 cages that can undergo interspecific transformations. The cages, being based on natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate high cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations.








Abstract
The rational design and selective self&#8208;assembly of flexible and unsymmetric ligands into large coordination complexes is an eminent challenge in supramolecular coordination chemistry. Here, we present the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of natural ursodeoxycholic&#8208;bile&#8208;acid&#8208;derived unsymmetric tris&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L) resulting in the selective and switchable formation of chiral stellated Pd6L8 and Pd12L16 cages. The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self&#8208;sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right&#8208;handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.

&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Pd&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; cages. The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self-sorting of &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right-handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyridine Nitrogen Decorated Carbon Support for High&#8208;Performance Seawater Electrolyte&#8208;Based Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support loaded Fe single&#8208;atom sites to improve the oxygen reduction reaction performance in seawater electrolyte. The study reveals that the pyridinic nitrogen in situ constructs a localized negatively charged interface during the reaction process, which effectively blocks the attack of Cl&#8315; from seawater on both the carbon support and active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic stability.








Abstract
Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl&#8722; in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst [Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential (Eonset) and halfwave potential (E1/2) of 1.174 and 0.907&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (Eonset: 0.972&#160;V, E1/2: 0.848&#160;V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 800&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl&#8722; adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.

         <title>Selective Scission of Orthogonal Bonds in Four&#8208;Membered Ring Mechanophores upon Activation by a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane actuator controls bond scission&#8212;perpendicular or parallel to the axle&#8212;based on bulky group orientation in a 4&#8208;membered ring. This allows diverse functional molecules to be released from a single core structure, expanding the molecular variety obtainable from new or existing mechanophores.








Abstract
Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4&#8208;membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.

         <title>Dual Co Sites in n&#9472;n Type Heterojunction Enable Selective Electrochemical Co&#8208;Valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

Dual Co sites and built&#8208;in electric field in CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C were used for selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C n&#9472;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12&#160;V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#9472;to&#9472;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#160;h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#9472;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#9472;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi&#8208;functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Controlled Crystallization Kinetics via Conjugated Organic Spacers Enables Ordered Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy is innovatively developed to regulate tin&#8208;based perovskite crystallization kinetics by constructing two&#8208;dimensional growth template for reducing lattice orientational mismatch through energetically unfavorable pathway, yielding desirable facet orientation. Ultimately, the resulting device delivers the highest power conversion efficiency of 14.03% with outstanding reproducibility by two&#8208;step sequential deposition.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced &#960;&#8208;conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)&#8208;dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI2 to pre&#8208;form NEA2SnI4, which subsequently converts to NEA2FASn2I7 and ultimately FASnI3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Consequently, the NEAI&#8208;based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04&#160;cm2) and 12.44% (1&#160;cm2), representing the record performance for two&#8208;step deposited tin&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin&#8208;based perovskite films, paving the way for high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin-based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out-of-plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi-epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced &#960;-conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)-dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to pre-form NEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which subsequently converts to NEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FASn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and ultimately FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long-term stability. Consequently, the NEAI-based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 12.44% (1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), representing the record performance for two-step deposited tin-based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin-based perovskite films, paving the way for high-performance lead-free perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of a Diterpene Synthase for Chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E from Chryseobacterium Joostei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bacterial diterpene synthase CjCS for chryseojoostenes was mechanistically characterised through labelling experiments, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and conversion of substrate analogs with blocked reactivity. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to minor enzyme products, including chryseojoostene E, whose biosynthesis involves a long&#8208;range hydrogen shift that is also relevant to its EIMS fragmentation.








Abstract
A diterpene synthase from Chryseobacterium joostei was characterised and produces the five unique compounds chryseojoostenes A&#8211;E. Chryseojoostenes D and E were produced in too low amounts for isolation from the wildtype enzyme, but extensive site&#8208;directed mutagenesis resulted in an enzyme variant in which the production of these compounds was enhanced. The biosynthesis of the enzyme products was investigated in detail through a combined experimental and computational approach, indicating a complex hydrogen scrambling during terpene cyclisation and a long&#8208;range proton shift towards chryseojoostene E. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that a similar long range hydrogen shift is involved in the formation of an even fragment ion (m/z 216), characterising the unique chemistry of the chryseojoostene skeleton. Further insights into the cyclisation mechanism were obtained by enzymatic conversion of two substrate analogs with reduced reactivity.

         <title>Tunable Multistate Mechanoresistance in a Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Incorporating Energy&#8208;Dissipative Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded sacrificial unit exhibits enhanced mechanoresistive behavior. The sacrificial conformational transition can be achieved through the regulation of intramolecular dispersion forces, while realizing multiple stable electrical signals as the junction is compressed and stretched, laying the foundation for constructing multimodal mechanical molecular switches at the molecular level.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive molecular devices are capable of exhibiting dynamic responses to external mechanical stimuli, enabling applications in smart materials, nano&#8208;devices, and flexible electronics. However, energy conversion induced by mechanical stimuli requires efficient energy dissipation mechanisms. Traditional methods often involve bond breaking or incomplete energy release, which can lead to device failure during continuous operations. Therefore, ensuring the mechanical stability of molecular devices under cyclic external forces remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a pillar[6]arene&#8208;like cyclophane (PLC) as an energy&#8208;dissipative structure to construct a programmable multistate mechanoswitching at the single&#8208;molecule level. We observed that, compared to rigid molecules with low energy dissipation, PLC&#8208;based macrocyclic molecular devices not only withstand mechanical stretching up to 6&#160;&#197; but also exhibit three stable states during the mechanical stretching/compressing processes. Combined with theoretical calculations, we confirm that these three distinct states are related to the charge transport pathways and the strength of the electrode&#8208;molecule interface coupling. This work establishes energy dissipation as a core design principle for multistate mechanoelectronic devices.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable and Tunable Polyolefin&#8208;Like Multiblock Copolymer Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock copolymer adhesives with tunable cohesion and adhesion. By controlling crystallinity, ester content, and block structure, these materials achieve up to &#8764;80% stronger adhesion than EVA, while enabling depolymerization, reuse, and multilayer deconstruction&#8212;offering a sustainable and high&#8208;performance HMA platform.








Abstract
Adhesives are important in creating multilayer products, such as in packaging and construction. Most current hot&#8208;melt adhesives such as poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) (EVA) and polyurethanes lack chemical recyclability and do not easily de&#8208;bond, complicating recycling. Here, we achieved tunable adhesive properties of chemically recyclable polyolefin&#8208;like multiblock copolymers through regulating the incorporation of crystalline hard blocks, amorphous soft blocks, and ester content highlighted by adhesive strengths up to 6.80&#160;MPa. We further demonstrated applications of these adhesives in multi&#8208;layer films and showed that the adhesives can be readily de&#8208;bonded, recovered, and chemically recycled. Overall, this study into structure&#8211;property relationships, including effects of crystallinity, soft&#8208;block incorporation, and ester content of the multiblock copolymers on adhesive properties, has resulted in a modular hot&#8208;melt adhesive platform that exhibits chemical recyclability for virgin&#8208;quality adhesive re&#8208;generation, reprocessability for repeated reuse of the recovered adhesive, and tunability for designing adhesives with a wide range of low to high (up to &#8764;80% stronger than EVA) adhesion strengths.

         <title>Antiferroelectric SnO2 Network with Amorphous Surface for Electrochemical N2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study report the utilization of antiferroelectric dipole configurations to engineer oriented electric fields to synergistically couple N2 adsorption. Building on this foundation, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surface was engineered to maximize N2 adsorption efficiency and active site accessibility. As a result, this design achieves one of the highest performance and efficiency reported to date for aqueous electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation&#8208;a sustainable pathway for converting abundant N2 into NH3 using renewable energy&#8208;holds transformative potential for revolutionizing artificial nitrogen cycles. Nevertheless, even the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems also suffer from inadequate N2 adsorption capacity, which critically limits ammonia production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this bottleneck, we strategically leveraged the antiferroelectric properties of SnO2 to establish dipole&#8211;dipole interactions with N2 molecules, synergistically enhancing both N2 adsorption and activation kinetics. Building on this foundation, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous SnO2 network with unsaturated amorphous surfaces. Both experiment and first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that all the exposed antiferroelectric surfaces could effectively adsorb N2, enhancing the N2 adsorption ability and maximizing active sites accessibility. The optimized catalyst delivers exceptional performance, achieving an NH3 production rate of 57.38&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1mg&#8722;1cat and a FE of 33.26%, representing one of the highest reported values among aqueous&#8208;phase ammonia synthesis catalysts. These breakthroughs not only establish a universal design framework for gas&#8208;involving electrocatalysts but also pioneer an integrated strategy to elevate nitrogen utilization efficiency in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Engineered Anion Regulation Enables Fast&#8208;Charging Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;engineered ZIF&#8208;8 separators with preferential (110) exposure enable directional Li+ flux by anchoring TFSI&#8722; anions at unsaturated Zn sites, suppressing lithium dendrite growth and stabilizing the interface. The microporous architecture further regulates lithium plating, supporting high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle lithium metal batteries under practical conditions.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) offer exceptional energy density and output voltage. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish ion transport and uncontrolled lithium dendrite formation, particularly under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, we report a facet&#8208;engineered anion&#8208;regulating separator based on zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with preferentially crystal&#8208;exposed (110) facets. The coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers on this surface serve as Lewis acid sites that selectively anchor bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions (TFSI&#8722;), inducing directional Li+ flux and suppressing dendritic growth. Concurrently, the microporous framework facilitates spatial lithium confinement, mitigating local current density and enhancing interfacial stability. As a result, the engineered separator enables ultra&#8208;stable cycling of Li||Cu cells for over 1400 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7%. In full&#8208;cell configurations, LiFePO4 (LFP) cells exhibit 99.9% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles at 5 C, while high&#8208;loading Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 12.30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cell retains 84.4% of its capacity after 135 cycles. Furthermore, a Li||LFP pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 19.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 demonstrates robust cycling over 170 cycles. These findings establish facet&#8208;engineered separators based on framework materials as a versatile and scalable strategy for advancing stable and fast&#8208;charging metal batteries.

         <title>Quantitative Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of On&#8208;Origami DNA Conformation and Reactivity Under Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging method based on DNA origami frameworks to quantify electric field effects on DNA conformation and hybridization properties at the single&#8208;molecule level. The regulation patterns of applied potential and scanning duration on the activity of DNA probes are determined and electric field&#8208;induced structural relaxation in DNA frameworks is revealed.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled DNA nanostructures have been popularly used to develop DNA&#8208;based electrochemical sensors by exploiting the nanoscale positioning capability of DNA origami. However, the impact of the electric field on the structural stability of the DNA origami framework and the activity of carried DNA probes remains to be explored. Herein, we employ DNA origami as structural frameworks for reversible DNA hybridization, and develop a single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging method to quantify electric field effects on DNA conformation and hybridization properties at the single&#8208;molecule level. Through single&#8208;molecule temporal kinetic analysis of hybridization events occurring on individual DNA origami, we systematically determine the regulation patterns of applied potential and scanning duration on the activity of DNA probes. Optical super&#8208;resolution reconstruction of probe sites reveals electric field&#8208;induced structural relaxation in DNA frameworks. This approach not only provides insights into electrochemical DNA sensing devices, but also lays the foundation for developing hybrid electrical&#8211;optical analysis at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Cost Lacunary Metal&#8208;Oxo Framework Enables Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework, BSiW9, serves as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs, resulting in not only a remarkable PCE but also outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture usually exhibit decent efficiency due to the easily tunable energy levels of organic interfacial layers (ILs). However, their operational lifetime is limited by the morphological instability of organic ILs especially the electron&#8208;transporting layer (ETL) that shows strong self&#8208;aggregation tendency. Besides, organic ETLs are confronted with significant challenges including large batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations and high costs. Herein, we develop an inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. The resultant molecule, BSiW9, not only shows ultralow cost but also leads to significantly enhanced electron extraction in OSCs. Moreover, the redox activity of BSiW9 allows reinforced electrical conductivity by using a hydroquinone&#8208;derivative dopant, HQ. The doping strategy finally results in a remarkable PCE of 20.5% in p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSC, largely outperforming that using organic ETLs. Meanwhile, an outstanding long&#8208;term stability is obtained in this champion device, with 92% of original efficiency maintained after a maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking for 1250&#160;h, among the longest lifetimes of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing rationally tailored low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;oxo framework as ILs for more industrially compatible OSCs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimulus Programmed Multiphase Separation and Organization in Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimulus programmed coacervate transformation system is developed. The sequential application of pH and salt concentration induces transition of membrane&#8208;less coacervates into nested multiphase coacervates and, ultimately, into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates. This transition endows selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, and facilitates the spatial orchestration of enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive (multiphase) coacervates deserve significant attention as cell&#8208;like entities that can adapt to their environment and undergo morphological reconfiguration. In this study, a tandem&#8208;triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single&#8208;phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid&#8208;labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane&#8208;less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single&#8208;phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem&#8208;triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate&#8208;based protocells.

         <title>Emphasizing a&#8208;parameter Expansion in Lattice Distortions of Disordered Rock Salt Li3V2O5: From Crystallographic Design to Feasible Large&#8208;Scale Chemical Lithiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study identifies lithium naphthalene as a lithiation agent for the large&#8208;scale preparation of disordered rock&#8208;salt Li3V2O5, investigates the impact of chemical lithiation on electrochemical behavior, and decouples lattice distortion modes using DFT calculations. A one&#8208;step synthesis method produces materials with an elongated a&#8208;axis, enhancing rate capability and providing a solid theoretical basis for industrialization.








Abstract
Disordered rock&#8208;salt Li3V2O5 (DRX&#8208;LVO) anode exhibits distinctive 3D Li+ percolation transport networks, which offers the unique advantage for ultra&#8208;charging. However, the existing chemical lithiation preparation routes not only pose safety risks due to the use of highly reactive reagents but also inevitably result in products with poor crystallinity. Investigating the origin, impact, and strategies for crystallinity degradation is pivotal for advancing the industrialization of chemical lithiation. To address the safety issue, different lithiation reagents were evaluated from the perspective of lone electron activity, and lithium naphthalene was identified as an ideal reagent balancing safety and efficiency. Through DFT calculations, the mechanism underlying different types of distortions in the DRX system was decoupled while the distinct effects of a/b/c&#8208;axis variations on migration energy barriers were elucidated. Guided by theoretical insights, the a&#8208;axis was nominated as the critical parameter for enhancing electrochemical performance, leading to the development of Li3V2O5 with elongated a&#8208;axis dimensions that exhibit significantly improved rate capabilities (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1). This study elucidates the distortion mechanisms via exploring the correlation among chemical lithiation feasibility, lattice tuning and kernel parameter confirmation, as well as fast&#8208;charging behavior, shedding light on precise crystallographic design on high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging anode.

Guided by theoretical insights, the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis was nominated as the critical parameter for enhancing electrochemical performance, leading to the development of Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with elongated &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis dimensions that exhibit significantly improved rate capabilities (80 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This study elucidates the distortion mechanisms via exploring the correlation among chemical lithiation feasibility, lattice tuning and kernel parameter confirmation, as well as fast-charging behavior, shedding light on precise crystallographic design on high-performance fast-charging anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure Reconfiguration of Zn&#8208;NxB4&#8208;x Sites for Enhanced Fenton&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;introducing electronically reconfigures the inert Zn2+ 3d10 center into active Zn&#8208;NxB4&#8331;x sites (Zn&#8208;NBC), endowing the catalyst with a 26&#8208;fold boost in Fenton&#8208;like pollutant degradation by strengthening PDS adsorption and promoting &#183;O2&#8722; and 1O2 generation.








Abstract
Despite growing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for Fenton&#8208;like reactions, zinc (Zn)&#8208;based SACs remain unexplored due to the inherent inertness of Zn2+, whose fully occupied 3d10 electronic configuration limits redox activity. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing boron (B) atoms to reconfigure the electronic structure of Zn&#8208;N4 coordination sites, yielding an activated catalyst denoted as Zn&#8208;NBC. This electronic modulation transforms inert Zn&#8208;N4 sites into catalytically active centers (Zn&#8208;NxB4&#8208;x), enabling significantly enhanced Fenton&#8208;like activity. Compared to the unmodified Zn&#8208;N4 catalyst (Zn&#8208;N4C), Zn&#8208;NBC exhibits a 26&#8208;fold increase in the rate of organic pollutant degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results reveal that Zn&#8208;N4C and Zn&#8208;NBC exhibit distinct PDS adsorption behaviors, with B incorporation tuning both adsorption strength and electronic interactions at the Zn center. Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis further demonstrates that the Zn&#8208;NBC facilitates the activation of the S&#9472;O bonds in peroxydisulfate (PDS), promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species, including peroxide radicals and singlet oxygen. These findings establish a new paradigm for activating electronically inert metal centers and position Zn&#8208;NBC as a promising platform for efficient and sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Locked Polymeric STING Nano&#8208;Agonist/Sonosensitizer Augments Spatiotemporally Controlled Cancer Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
STING agonists offer enormous prospects in cancer immunotherapy. Nonetheless, controllable delivery of STING agonists remains elusive. Here, we report sono&#8208;enzyme dual&#8208;triggered polymeric nanoplatform for precision delivery of STING agonist MSA&#8208;2 and sonosensitizers. This paradigm demonstrates superior competence in augmenting antigen&#8208;specific immunity, which combines with sonodynamic therapy, yielding remarkable therapeutic outcomes and well&#8208;tolerated safety in a murine preclinical tumor model.








Abstract
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a central target in cancer immunotherapy, but current STING agonist therapies lack precision control, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes and systematic adverse effects. Herein, we engineered a dual&#8208;locked immuno&#8208;polymeric nanoplatform (IPN) with precise spatiotemporal control over the release of STING agonists to enhance cancer immunotherapy. This platform, constructed from biocompatible poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters) (PBAE), incorporates the STING agonist (MSA&#8208;2) covalently linked via ester bonds, which is co&#8208;assembled with a sonosensitizer. Upon activation by ultrasound and natural esterase enzyme, IPN significantly enhances the localized release of MSA&#8208;2 within the tumor. Alongside, this platform augments the generation of toxic radicals, leading to the spread of tumor antigens and immunogenic biomolecules, subsequently initiating a high magnitude of antigen&#8208;specific T cells for tumor eradication. The multifaceted advantages of ultrasound and enzymes synergistically enhance the physical contact and spatial organization of immune&#8208;related reactants as well as chemical bioprocesses. This dual&#8208;locked IPN platform demonstrates an eight fold greater tumor inhibition compared to single&#8208;locked counterparts and a four fold enhancement over the summation effect, highlighting a safer and more effective paradigm for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Catalysis of Radical Coupling Reaction via Synergistic Action of Oriented External Electric Field and Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free C&#9472;N radical coupling reaction in a single&#8208;molecule junction is demonstrated. After the molecule is excited by ultraviolet irradiation, the oriented external electric field synergistically facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms and triggers the radical coupling reaction by lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Radical coupling reactions have been widely used in the synthesis of complex organic molecules, materials science, and drug research. However, restricted conditions or special catalysts are required to overcome the energy barrier and trigger the coupling reaction efficiently. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that the C&#9472;N radical coupling reactions can be significantly accelerated by an oriented external electric field (OEEF) under synchronous UV irradiation without a catalyst. By repeatedly forming thousands of single&#8208;molecular junctions with reactant molecules in nonpolar solvents under a bias voltage, a new conductance plateau was observed upon UV irradiation, which was completely absent in polar solvents owing to the electrical shielding effect. This finding indicates that the radicals generated under light irradiation can timely participate in the coupling reaction under the in situ action of OEEF, leading to the high&#8208;efficiency generation of the C&#9472;N radical coupling product, which was confirmed by the measured electron paramagnetic spectrum and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. With the assistance of theoretical calculations, the underlying mechanism was further revealed, i.e., OEEF can significantly decrease the reaction barrier and facilitate the intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This study provides a catalyst&#8208;free paradigm for high&#8208;efficiency radical reactions.

         <title>Engineering Covalent and Noncovalent Interface Synergy in MXenes for Ultralong&#8208;life and Efficient Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the ANF&#8208;mediated thermal reconstruction, we achieved the deep modification of MXene with synergistic noncovalent/covalent interaction toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off between the reactivity and stability for energetic pseudocapacitive storage chemistry. The unique synergistic interface effects trigger a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180, 000 cycles.








Abstract
MXenes serve as pivotal candidates for pseudocapacitive energy storage owing to sound proton/electron&#8208;transport capability and tunable topology. However, the metastable surface terminal properties and the progressive oxidation leads to drastic capacity fading, posing significant challenges for sustainable energy applications. Here, with the aramid nanofiber as the interface mediator, we engineer the thermal reconstruction of MXenes to synergistically introduce interfacial covalent and noncovalent interactions, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 531.9 F g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 92.2% after 180,&#160;000 cycles. In&#8208;situ heating transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrate the formation of ultrafine mesopores with interfacial reconstitution for mass transport intensification. Theoretical calculations indicate electronic accumulation adjacent to the covalent bonds, endowing the heterogeneous interface with fast electronic conduction capability and favorable adsorption of H+. In addition, the dual modification improves the oxidation energy barrier of MXenes to TiO2, resulting in a thermodynamically promoted and sustainable storage microenvironment. Our research emphasizes the synergistic mechanism of noncovalent interactions and covalent bonding toward an optimal reaction interface, which breaks the trade&#8208;off of MXenes between the reactivity and stability for energetic energy storage.

Broadband rotational spectroscopy reveals how 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene forms stronger F&#8943;C tetrel and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with CO2, versus weaker CH&#8943;F hydrogen bonds with CH4, along with intriguing tunneling motions. These molecular&#8208;level insights could benefit the design of ligands for selective gas adsorption in MOFs and related materials.








Abstract
The cluster growth behavior of CO2 and CH4 on an aromatic ligand has been studied through the unambiguous identification of complex structures of 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene&#8208;(CO2)1&#8211;4 and &#8208;&#223;(CH4)1&#8211;2 using broadband rotational spectroscopy in conjunction with extensive theoretical calculations. The results reveal a contrast in the thermodynamically favorable ligand&#8208;gas binding sites and noncovalent interactions of the two gaseous molecules on the ligand. The observation of a tunneling splitting and large centrifugal distortions indicates that CH4 molecules bind to the fluorinated &#960; system via three weak hydrogen bonds without CH4 self&#8208;interactions, resulting in an effective structure displaced toward the dissociation limit. Conversely, CO2 shows diverse and stronger intermolecular interactions with the fluorinated benzene, including F&#9472;C tetrel bonding, lone pair to &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and a significant contribution from CO2 self&#8208;interactions. The thorough examination of ligand&#8211;gas interactions and aggregation patterns highlights the significant capacity and selectivity of the fluorinated aromatic ligand for accepting CO2 over CH4.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Polypseudorotaxanes Crosslinked by Dynamic Disulfide Bonds as Modular Functionalization for Thiophilic Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled thiol&#8208;rich polypseudorotaxanes with high modularity were developed via a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; preparation through the threading of thiolated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins on polymers and subsequent oxidation of thiols into disulfide bonds. This dynamic motif was used as a functionalization platform for thiophilic metal nanoparticles, either tethering them to a photothermal hydrogel or for their surface functionalization with nanoscopic &#8220;wrapping&#8221;.








Abstract
As supramolecular assemblies, polypseudorotaxanes (PPR) exhibit inherent advantages in modular adaptability and structural programmability, with the potential to build tuneable platforms integrating various functionalities. Here we report the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; preparation of a self&#8208;assembled thiol&#8208;rich PPR (SPPR), where thiolated&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (SH&#945;CD) spontaneously thread onto polymers, and are then crosslinked into a three&#8208;dimensional network by the thermally&#8208;triggered oxidation of thiols into disulfide bonds. The dynamic thiol groups along the SPPR provide remarkable modularity for the functionalization of thiophilic metal nanoparticles (NPs), exemplified by two application vectors. First, SPPR were used as building blocks of a thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel to incorporate thiophilic NPs, where NPs are tethered to the networks and, in turn, reinforce its mechanical properties. The resulting gels, characterized by small&#8208;angle neutron&#8208;scattering and rheology, display photo&#8208;responsive gelation and thixotropy. In the second application, the affinity of metal NPs to the dynamic thiol groups on SPPR was exploited to &#8220;wrap&#8221; the polymers around the NPs, through simple tuning of concentration and chain length. The flexible polydisulfides layer endows NPs with enhanced cancer cytotoxicity, possibly via the thiol&#8208;mediated uptake pathway. These results establish SPPR as a powerful functionalization platform, offering a promising route toward customized supramolecular materials.

         <title>LL&#8208;37 and Its Truncated Fragments Modulate Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Dynamics, Aggregation and Toxicity Through Hetero&#8208;Oligomer and Cluster Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LL&#8208;37 and its truncates modulate A&#946;40 primary nucleation by forming hetero&#8208;oligomers, nanoclusters, and microclusters, which act as off&#8208;pathway aggregates inhibiting fibrillation. These transient assemblies influence fibril progression and cytotoxicity, highlighting the dynamic interplay between aggregation and toxicity. Integrating nanoscale and microscale perspectives provides mechanistic insight into A&#946;40&#8211;LL&#8208;37 interactions and informs therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
LL&#8208;37 and its variants with amphiphilic structure can modulate amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibril formation, but the detailed mechanism behind it is still unclear. By using four different peptides (LL&#8208;37, LL&#8208;379&#8211;32, LL&#8208;3718&#8211;29, LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28), we found these peptides affect A&#946;40 aggregation differently. Nanoscale analysis showed that all LL&#8208;37 peptides form hetero&#8208;oligomers and nanoclusters with A&#946;40, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28, which exhibit the strongest inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation, form more hetero&#8208;oligomers and smaller nanoclusters. This suggests that hetero&#8208;oligomers and small nanoclusters may represent an off&#8208;pathway, preventing the formation of productive aggregates. At the microscale, all LL&#8208;37 peptides were found to promote A&#946; cluster formation, but LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 can form larger clusters with A&#946; rapidly, emphasizing that smaller nanoclusters can assemble to macroscale clusters easier, inducing more toxic aggregates. Both nanoscopic and microscopic mechanisms revealed inhibition of A&#946; fibrillation by all LL&#8208;37 peptides, impacting A&#946; primary and secondary nucleation, while only LL&#8208;37 and LL&#8208;3719&#8211;28 affected A&#946; elongation. Our findings highlight the role of LL&#8208;37 and its synthetic fragments in A&#946;40 aggregation across different scales, particularly focusing on cluster formation at the nanoscale and microscale to fill the knowledge gap between oligomerization and fibrillation.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Mediated Hydrochloric Acid Dissolution: Enabling Clean and Efficient Recovery of Palladium from Spent Catalysts by Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithium&#8208;mediated electrodeposition process (Pd0&#8594;Li2Pd&#8594;Li2PdO2) overcomes the challenge of palladium dissolution in dilute hydrochloric acid and enables efficient recovery. High&#8208;purity palladium deposits with a low lattice strain were obtained by regulating the voltage and concentration.








Abstract
To address palladium supply&#8211;demand challenges and conventional recovery inefficiencies, this study develops a lithium&#8208;mediated electrodeposition process for efficient palladium recycling from spent catalysts. Density functional theory calculations identified a controlled Pd0&#8594;Li2Pd (Pd&#948;&#8722;)&#8594;Li2PdO2 (Pd2+) transformation pathway, and experimental verification confirmed that Li2Pd precursors underwent oxidative transformation into Li2PdO2 with structural inheritance. Li2PdO2 exhibited Pd2+&#8211;O2&#8722; coordination and underwent rapid dissolution in dilute hydrochloric acid. Pd2+ exhibits a quasi&#8208;reversible redox process, thereby eliminating multivalent&#8208;state&#8208;induced efficiency losses. Field simulations demonstrated that the anisotropic current distribution in the 2D electrode plane drove the edge effects, which directly controlled the annular palladium deposition at the base. Electrodeposition produced a phase&#8208;pure palladium deposit with high (111)&#8208;textured crystallinity and ultralow lattice strain. Elevated voltages enhanced the nucleation density, inducing a morphological transition from dendritic to compact clusters, while the amplified edge effects promoted the formation of mossy structures. Elevated Pd2+ concentrations triggered mass&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven competitive growth, resulting in the transition of palladium deposits from uniform grains to particles with graded size distributions. This work addresses the critical challenge of inefficient palladium dissolution using a phase&#8208;engineering strategy and establishes an integrated dissolution&#8208;electrodeposition framework that enables the high&#8208;efficiency recovery of secondary palladium resources.

         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic ubiquitin&#8208;based probe, Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2, was developed to selectively label sulfenylated deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH).

Activity&#8208;based ubiquitin probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) are powerful tools for studying the functional landscape of deubiquitinases (DUBs). While most existing Ub probes have focused on examining the native state of DUBs, oxidative stress, especially in cancer and inflammatory contexts, can oxidize the catalytic cysteine of DUBs, significantly altering their activity. Here, we developed three novel ubiquitin&#8208;based activity probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) to selectively trap the sulfenylated form of deubiquitinases (DUB&#8208;SOH). These probes employ ubiquitin as the recognition element and incorporate distinct warheads: an electrophilic norbornene moiety (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;NMA) or dimedone&#8208;derived cyclic C&#8208;nucleophiles (Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2), enabling covalent capture of oxidized cysteine residues. Of these, Biotin&#8208;Ub&#8208;PRD and Biotin&#8208;Ub75&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 successfully labeled DUB&#8208;SOH, highlighting the importance of proper probe&#8208;substrate interaction for effective trapping. Optimization of the ubiquitin length showed that the Ub74 variant displayed enhanced affinity toward DUB&#8208;SOH. Biotin&#8208;Ub74&#8208;DYn&#8208;2 enabled enrichment and identification of DUB&#8208;SOH targets via immunocapture and label&#8208;free quantitative proteomics. Collectively, these sulfenic acid&#8208;targeting Ub&#8208;ABPs represent versatile tools for elucidating redox&#8208;dependent DUB regulation, with potential applications in understanding redox dysregulation in disease contexts.

         <title>Chemically Stable Tetrazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages with Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification via Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions for SF6/N2 and CO2/N2 Separation</title>

A rigid tetrazine&#8208;based porous organic cage with record SF6 uptake is post&#8208;synthetically tuned via iEDDA chemistry to enhance stability, and further polymerized into networked materials with tunable porosity for selective CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) have emerged as promising porous materials for a wide range of applications. However, their development is often limited by insufficient chemical stability and challenges in systematically functionalization. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a tetrazine&#8208;based POC (TC1) featuring rigid tetrahedral structure, prepared via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. TC1 exhibits high porosity, with a BET surface area at 1157&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1, and good chemically stability, surpassing most POCs formed through dynamic covalent chemistry. Its well&#8208;defined, electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity enable efficient SF6/N2 separation, showing the highest SF6 adsorption capacity and selectivity among all reported porous molecular materials to data, as confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Post&#8208;synthetic modification of TC1 via inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions yielded two functionalized cages (TC2 and TC3), which maintain good porosity and display further enhanced chemical stability over a broad pH range (&#8208;1 to 15). Furthermore, cage&#8208;based networked materials (TC1&#8208;P1 and TC1&#8208;P2) were successfully constructed through the iEDDA polymerization using TC1 as building unit, resulting in tunable porous frameworks with improved CO2/N2 selectivity.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant, Red Light&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Easily Degradable and High Molecular Weight &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid&#8208;Vinyl Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;light&#8208;driven, oxygen&#8208;tolerant reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using methylene (MB+) and triethanolamine (TEOA) enables the synthesis of degradable &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid&#8211;vinyl copolymers with high molar mass (600&#160;000 g mol&#8722;1), low dispersity, and high LA incorporation. The method tolerates diverse vinyl comonomers and yields poly(disulfide)s degradable by reducing agents, UV light, or ambient sunlight. 








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Lipoic acid (LA) has recently emerged as an attractive, inexpensive monomer for synthesizing degradable polymers via ring&#8208;opening of its 1,2&#8208;dithiolane, introducing easily cleavable disulfide linkages into polymer backbones. Reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization with vinyl monomers enables access to degradable poly(disulfide)s with controlled molecular weights. However, conventional thermal RAFT methods suffer from oxygen sensitivity, limited LA incorporation (&lt;40 mol%), and modest degrees of polymerization (DP&#160;&lt;&#160;300). Here, we report an oxygen&#8208;tolerant, red&#8208;light&#8208;driven RAFT approach using methylene blue (MB&#8314;) as a photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor. This photoRAFT strategy affords well&#8208;defined LA&#8211;vinyl copolymers with DPs exceeding 6000, relatively low dispersities (&#272; = 1.1&#8211;1.6), and LA incorporations up to 68 mol%. The method is compatible with a broad range of functional comonomers, including hydrophilic, charged, and zwitterionic acrylates and acrylamides, yielding water&#8208;soluble degradable polymers. The resulting copolymers are readily degradable by disulfide&#8208;reducing agents, UV light, and ambient sunlight. Overall, this mild and efficient platform overcomes the limitations of thermal RAFT, providing improved access to functional, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight degradable LA copolymers, suggesting potential applications as biocompatible plastics and biomedical materials.

         <title>Anchoring Ligand Electron Enables Robust Metal&#8208;Oxygen Coordination Toward 4.5&#160;V O3&#8208;Type Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage structure degradation in O3&#8208;type layered oxides arises from co&#8208;deteriorating coupling between &#963;&#8208;type oxygen redox and cationic migrations. An anchoring ligand electron (ALE) strategy is proposed to confine oxygen redox in stable &#960;&#8208;type configurations, reinforcing metal&#8208;oxygen coordination. Calcium ions, identified via multi&#8208;level screening as the optimal anchor agent, impart robust structural stability at 4.5&#160;V during cycling.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage operation enables sodium&#8208;sufficient O3&#8208;type layered oxides to approach the maximum achievable energy densities for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This high&#8208;voltage regime, however, induces structural degradation strongly correlated with oxygen redox activity, a mechanism still incompletely resolved. Using prototypical O3&#8208;type NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) as a model system, we identify the origin of this instability as a detrimental feedback loop between &#963;&#8208;type oxygen redox and cation migration. We thus propose an &#8220;anchoring ligand electron (ALE)&#8221; strategy, employing a multi&#8208;level screening protocol to identify optimal anchor agents that confine oxygen redox to stable &#960;&#8208;type configurations with robust metal&#8208;oxygen coordination. The ALE&#8208;engineered NFM cathode mitigates excessive oxygen ligand electron transfer, achieving record capacity retention at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.5&#160;V after 300 cycles. The superior cyclic stability is demonstrated to be closely associated with the stable &#960;&#8208;type oxygen redox and suppressed metal&#8208;oxygen decoordination. This ALE strategy expands the optimization pathway toward ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polycrystalline lithium-rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high-capacity cathode for next-generation all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid-state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one-step, low-temperature (&amp;lt;200 &#176;C) co-sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co-sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d-O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO-based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g-1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO-based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
