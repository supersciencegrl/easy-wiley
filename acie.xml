         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Melt&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of reprocessable and reprogrammable soft actuators is limited by the synthetic strategies, 3D&#8208;shaping capabilities, and small deformations. In this work, melt&#8208;processable supramolecular soft actuators based on segmented copolymers containing thiourethane and liquid crystal segments have been prepared via sequential thiol addition reactions in a one&#8208;pot approach using commercially available building blocks. The actuators demonstrated immediate, reversible response and weightlifting capabilities with large deformations up to 32%. Through exploiting the supramolecular cross&#8208;links, the material could be recycled and reprogrammed into 3D actuators and welded into an actuator assembly with different deformation modes. Our work offers a one&#8208;pot synthesis and straightforward melt&#8208;processable approach to prepare supramolecular soft actuators with large deformations that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metallic conductivity in polyacetylene [&#8208;HC=CH&#8208;]n upon doping represents a landmark achievement. However, the insolubility of polyacetylene and a dearth of methods for its chemical modification have limited its widespread use. Here, we employ a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) protocol to prepare functionalized polyacetylenes (fPAs) bearing: (1) electron&#8208;deficient boryl (&#8208;BR2) and phosphoryl (&#8208;P(O)R2) side chains; (2) electron&#8208;donating amino (&#8208;NR2) groups, and (3) ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium units via strain&#8208;promoted Click chemistry. These functional groups render most of the fPAs soluble and can lead to intense light absorption across the visible to near&#8208;IR region. Also, the presence of redox&#8208;active boryl and amino groups leads to opposing near&#8208;IR optical responses upon (electro)chemical reduction or oxidation. Some of the resulting fPAs show greatly enhanced air stability when compared to known polyacetylenes. Lastly, these fPAs can be cross&#8208;linked to yield network materials with the full retention of optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Porphyrin&#8208;Complex Multi&#8208;Block Co&#8208;Oligomers by Defluorinative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface chemical reaction has become a very powerful technique to synthesize nanostructures by linking small molecules in the bottom&#8208;up approach. Given the fact that most reactants are simultaneously activated at certain temperatures, a sequential reaction in a controlled way has remained challenging. Here, we present an on&#8208;surface synthesis of multi&#8208;block co&#8208;oligomers from trifluoromethyl (CF  3  ) substituted porphyrin metal complexes. The oligomerization on Au(111) is demonstrated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even after the first oligomerization of single monomer unit, the termini of the oligomer keep the CF  3  group, which can be used as a reactant for further coupling in a sequential order. Consequently, copper, cobalt, and palladium complexes of bisanthracene&#8208;fused porphyrin oligomers were linked with each other in a designed order.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles: In Situ Access to Stable Constrained Peptides with Superior Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We report here a fundamentally new strategy for the facile generation of bicyclic peptides using linear precursor peptides with three cysteine residues and non&#8208;toxic trivalent bismuth(III) salt. Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles form instantaneously at physiological pH, are stable in aqueous solution for many weeks, and much more resistant to proteolysis than their linear precursors. The strategy allows the  in&#8208;situ  generation of bicyclic ligands for biochemical screening assays. We demonstrate this for two screening campaigns targeting the proteases from Zika and West Nile viruses, revealing a new lead compound that displayed inhibition constants of 23 and 150 nM, respectively. Bicyclic peptides are up to 130 times more active and 19 times more proteolytically stable than their linear analogs without bismuth.</dc:description>

         <title>Vectorial Catalysis in Surface&#8208;Anchored Nanometer&#8208;sized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Microfluidic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vectorial Catalysis &#8211; controlling multi&#8208;step reactions in a programmed sequence and by defined spatial localization in a microscale device &#8211; is an enticing goal in bio&#8208;inspired catalysis research. However, translating concepts from natural cascade biocatalysis into artificial hierarchical chemical systems remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate integration of two different surface&#8208;anchored nanometer&#8208;sized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a microfluidic device for modelling vectorial catalysis. Catalysts immobilization at defined sections along the microchannel and a two&#8208;step cascade reaction was conducted with full conversion after 30 seconds and high turnover frequencies (TOF = ~10  5  h  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC&#8217;s pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC&#8217;s synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99%. More surprisingly, mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the n&#8594;&#960;* Interaction in Alkene Isomerization by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fumarate to maleate (E&#8594;Z) isomerization was investigated to validate nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol based on selective energy transfer catalysis was developed with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer for the conversion of diverse fumarate derivatives, including tetrasubstituted alkenes. The involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Examples of geometric alkene isomerization in nature are often limited to the net exergonic direction (&#916;G&#176;&lt;0), with the antipodal net endergonic processes (&#916;G&#176;&gt;0) comparatively under&#8208;represented. Inspired by the expansiveness of the maleate to fumarate (Z&#8594;E) isomerization in biochemistry, we investigated the inverse E&#8594;Z variant to validate nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions as a driving force for contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization. A general protocol involving selective energy transfer catalysis with inexpensive thioxanthone as a sensitizer (&#955;max=402&#8197;nm) is disclosed. Whilst in the enzymatic process nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions commonly manifest themselves in the substrate, these same interactions are shown to underpin directionality in the antipodal reaction by shortening the product alkene chromophore. The process was validated with diverse fumarate derivatives (&gt;30 examples, up to Z:E&gt;99:1), including the first examples of tetrasubstituted alkenes, and the involvement of nO&#8594;&#960;C=O* interactions was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Visualization of Proton Transport Pathways at Water&#8211;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a method for imaging aqueous proton transport with spatial resolution and observed the lateral transport of protons along the nanofluidic interface. The dynamics of proton transport can be further captured by quantitative analysis, thanks to the temporal resolution of this optical imaging technique.







Abstract
Probing proton transport is of vital importance for understanding cellular transport, surface catalysis and fuel cells. Conventional proton transport measurements rely on the use of electrochemical conductivity and do not allow for the direct visualization of proton transport pathways. The development of novel experimental techniques to spatiotemporally resolve proton transport is in high demand. Here, building upon the general conversion of aqueous proton flux into spatially resolved fluorescence signals, we optically visualize proton transport through nanopores and along hydrophilic interfaces. We observed that the fluorescence intensity increased at negative voltage due to lateral transport. Thanks to the temporal resolution of optical imaging, our technique further empowers the analysis of proton transport dynamics.

         <title>Concurrent Prebiotic Formation of Nucleoside&#8208;Amidophosphates and Nucleoside&#8208;Triphosphates Potentiates Transition from Abiotic to Biotic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DAP mediated prebiotic phosphorylation of nucleosides/nucleotides/oligonucleotides produces a spectrum of the corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri(amido)phosphorylated derivatives which are substrates for both prebiotic&#8208;oligomerization and biotic&#8208;polymerization/ligation. The compatibility of the phosphorylation and activation chemistry across a broad spectrum of (oligo)nucleos(t)ide structures suggests a smoother transition from chemistry to biology.







Abstract
Polymerization of nucleic acids in biology utilizes 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) as substrates. The prebiotic availability of NTPs has been unresolved and other derivatives of nucleoside&#8208;monophosphates (NMPs) have been studied. However, this latter approach necessitates a change in chemistries when transitioning to biology. Herein we show that diamidophosphate (DAP), in a one&#8208;pot amidophosphorylation&#8208;hydrolysis setting converts NMPs into the corresponding NTPs via 5&#8242;&#8208;nucleoside amidophosphates (NaPs). The resulting crude mixture of NTPs are accepted by proteinaceous&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;polymerases as substrates for nucleic acid polymerization. This phosphorylation also operates at the level of oligonucleotides enabling ribozyme&#8208;mediated ligation. This one&#8208;pot protocol for simultaneous generation of NaPs and NTPs suggests that the transition from prebiotic&#8208;phosphorylation and oligomerization to an enzymatic processive&#8208;polymerization can be more continuous than previously anticipated.

         <title>Photoswitchable Nitrogen Superbases: Using Light for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controlled CO2 activation was achieved by the development of photoswitchable nitrogen superbases equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The reversible electrocyclic isomerization of the N&#8208;heterocyclic imine backbone is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of up to 8.7 units.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to alter the reactivity of Lewis bases is an intriguing tool for controlling chemical reactions. Reversible photoreactions associated with pronounced reactivity changes are particularly valuable in this regard. We herein report the first photoswitchable nitrogen superbases based on guanidines equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The resulting N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) undergo reversible, near quantitative electrocyclic isomerization upon successive exposure to UV and visible irradiation, as demonstrated over multiple cycles. Switching between the ring&#8208;opened and ring&#8208;closed states is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of the NHIs by up to 8.7 units. Since only the ring&#8208;closed isomers are sufficiently basic to activate CO2 via the formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts, cycling between the two isomeric states enables the light&#8208;controlled capture and release of CO2.

         <title>Metathesis by Partner Interchange in &#963;&#8208;Bond Ligands: Expanding Applications of the &#963;&#8208;CAM Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;complex assisted metathesis mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence.







Abstract
In 2007 two of us defined the &#963;&#8208;Complex Assisted Metathesis mechanism (Perutz and Sabo&#8208;Etienne, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 2578&#8211;2592), that is, the &#963;&#8208;CAM concept. This new approach to reaction mechanisms brought together metathesis reactions involving the formation of a variety of metal&#8211;element bonds through partner&#8208;interchange of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes. The key concept that defines a &#963;&#8208;CAM process is a single transition state for metathesis that is connected by two intermediates that are &#963;&#8208;bond complexes while the oxidation state of the metal remains constant in precursor, intermediates and product. This mechanism is appropriate in situations where &#963;&#8208;bond complexes have been isolated or computed as well&#8208;defined minima. Unlike several other mechanisms, it does not define the nature of the transition state. In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional &#963;&#8208;bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp2&#8208;carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8211;element bonds.

In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;-bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;-CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;-CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional &#963;-bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8211;element bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of [1.1.1]Propellane for the Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The third way: the umpolung of nucleophilic [1.1.1]propellane into an electrophilic halogen bond complex enables the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) after attack of anilines and azoles. DFT calculations show that the halogen bond interaction helps avoiding the decomposition of the BCP cage. This approach opens a third avenue to access functionalised BCPs besides the better explored radical and anionic strategies.







Abstract
Strategies commonly used for the synthesis of functionalised bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP) rely on the reaction of [1.1.1]propellane with anionic or radical intermediates. In contrast, electrophilic activation has remained a considerable challenge due to the facile decomposition of BCP cations, which has severely limited the applications of this strategy. Herein, we report the electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane in a halogen bond complex, which enables its reaction with electron&#8208;neutral nucleophiles such as anilines and azoles to give nitrogen&#8208;substituted BCPs that are prominent motifs in drug discovery. A detailed computational analysis indicates that the key halogen bonding interaction promotes nucleophilic attack without sacrificing cage stabilisation. Overall, our work rehabilitates electrophilic activation of [1.1.1]propellane as a valuable strategy for accessing functionalised BCPs.

         <title>Azaphilones as Activation&#8208;Free Primary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation Reagents for Peptides, Proteins and Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the generation mechanism of natural vinylogous  &#947;  &#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling syneresis of hydrogels using organic salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels can spontaneously undergo syneresis through fibre&#8208;fibre interactions and expel significant amounts of water upon aging. In this process, the hydrophobicity of fibres which regulates the 3D&#8208;rearrangement of the self&#8208;assembled structures during syneresis is important. Here, we show that we can control over the hydrophobic microenvironment of gels by incorporating organic salts into the gel fibre involving co&#8208;assembly enabling control of the macroscopic gel volume phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Environment Determined Reactant Adsorption Configuration for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Acetone Hydrogenation to Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In electrocatalysis, reactant and reaction intermediates&#8217; adsorption behavior plays a significant role in determining the catalyst&#8217;s selectivity to the target product. Currently, most adsorption configuration tunings were achieved by optimizing the electronic structures of specially designed catalysts. Here, we demonstrate a more widely applicable method to alter the adsorption configuration of multi&#8208;carbon containing reactants by no catalyst engineering but simply adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst surface. Using electrocatalytic acetone to propane hydrogenation (APH) as a model reaction and common commercial Pt   /   Pt&#8208;based materials as catalysts, we found local H  +  concentration can significantly influence the adsorption mode of acetone reactant, e.g. in vertical or flat mode, and target product&#8217;s selectivity. Electrocatalytic measurement combined with in&#8208;situ spectroscopic characterizations reveals that the vertically adsorbed acetone is favorable for propane production while the flatly adsorbed mode suppresses the reaction. Computation by density function theory (DFT) indicates that the H coverage on catalyst surface plays a decisive role in the adsorption configuration of acetone. The increased local acidity can facilitate the adsorption configuration of acetone from flat to vertical mode and suppress the competing hydrogen evaluation reaction, which consequently enhances the APH selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical organization of self&#8208;assembled structures into superstructures is omnipresent in Nature but has been rarely achieved in synthetic molecular assembly due to the absence of clear structural rules. We herein report the self&#8208;assembly of scissor&#8208;shaped azobenzene dyads which form discrete nanotoroids that further organize into 2D porous networks. The steric demand of the peripheral aliphatic units diminishes the trend of the azobenzene dyad to constitute stackable nanotoroids in solution, thus affording isolated (unstackable) nanotoroids upon cooling. Upon drying, these nanotoroids organize at graphite surface to form well&#8208;defined 2D porous networks. The photoirradiation with UV and visible light enabled reversible dissociation and reconstruction of nanotoroids through the efficient  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  isomerization of azobenzene moieties in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive overview of experimental elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals employs a rotation&#8208;invariant description of the Young's modulus to critically compare multiple observations and computational results. To encourage the wider use of experimental elastic constant tensors in studies of mechanical properties, outliers are clearly identified, resulting in a curated database of experimental results for molecular crystals.







Abstract
This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals, detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8211;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFT&#8208;D) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young's modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information&#8212;experimental and computational&#8212;in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure.

         <title>Atomistic Insights of Irreversible Li+ Intercalation in MnO2 Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithiation front region of one &#946;&#8208;MnO2 nanowire analyzed by in&#8197;situ TEM, where the MnO2/LiMnO2 interface featuring arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, is disclosed with its atomic structure clearly captured. The findings have a bearing on MnO2 open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 represents open&#8208;framed electrode materials for reversible energy storage. Its wide application is limited by its poor cycling stability, whose structural origin is unclear. We tracked the structure evolution of &#946;&#8208;MnO2 upon Li+ ion insertion/extraction by combining advanced in&#8197;situ diagnostic tools at both electrode level (synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering) and single&#8208;particle level (transmission electron microscopy). The instability is found to originate from a partially reversible phase transition between &#946;&#8208;MnO2 and orthorhombic LiMnO2 upon lithiation, causing cycling capacity decay. Moreover, the MnO2/LiMnO2 interface exhibits multiple arrow&#8208;headed disordered regions, which severely chop into the host and undermine its structural integrity. Our findings could account for the cycling instability of tunnel&#8208;structured materials, based on which future strategies should focus on tuning the charge transport kinetics toward performance enhancement.

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we introduced the fusogenic spherical nucleic acid (fuso&#8208;SNA) to achieve spatially controlled cell membrane engineering with DNA by using a liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) approach. We demonstrated asymmetric DNA modifications on the cell membrane with orthogonal functionalities on each side, realizing applications such as heterotypic cell assembly and intracellular metabolites detection.







Abstract
Engineering of the cell plasma membrane using functional DNA is important for studying and controlling cellular behaviors. However, most efforts to apply artificial DNA interactions on cells are limited to external membrane surface due to the lack of suitable synthetic tools to engineer the intracellular side, which impedes many applications in cell biology. Inspired by the natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we have developed a fusogenic spherical nucleic acid construct to realize robust DNA functionalization on both external and internal cell surfaces via liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT) strategy, which enables applications including the construction of heterotypic cell assembly for programmed signaling pathway and detection of intracellular metabolites. This approach can engineer cell membranes in a highly efficient and spatially controlled manner, allowing one to build anisotropic membrane structures with two orthogonal DNA functionalities.

         <title>Accessing Unsymmetrically Linked Heterocycles through Stereoselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solving alkynes of problems with palladium. A palladium&#8208;catalyzed domino cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered carbamoyl chlorides and aryl iodides with alkyne&#8208;tethered aryl nucleophiles is reported. This methodology unsymmetrically links heterocycles along a tetrasubstituted olefin with &gt;20:1 E/Z selectivity and up to 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed strategy is presented to synthesize unsymmetrically linked heterocycles within stereoselective tetrasubstituted olefins. This reaction is proposed to occur via a vinyl&#8208;PdII intermediate capable of initiating the cyclization of various alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles. Products are formed in up to 96&#8201;% yield and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained using low catalyst loadings. This transformation was scalable up to 1&#8197;mmol and mechanistic studies suggest a syn&#8208;carbopalladation of the carbamoyl chloride followed by PdII&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkyne&#8208;tethered nucleophiles.

         <title>3D Binary Mesocrystals from Anisotropic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic nanoparticles into large superstructures is a key component in the research of novel metamaterials. While the formation of mono&#8208;phase mesocrystals has been achieved in recent years, the self&#8208;assembly of binary structures from such particles remained highly challenging. A simple method enables the formation of binary mesocrystals from anisotropic iron oxide and platinum nanocubes in two and three dimensions.







Abstract
Binary mesocrystals offer the combination of nanocrystal properties in an ordered superstructure. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous self&#8208;assembly of platinum and iron oxide nanocubes into micrometer&#8208;sized 3D&#8197;mesocrystals using the gas&#8208;phase diffusion technique. By the addition of minor amounts of a secondary particle type tailored to nearly identical size, shape and surface chemistry, we were able to promote a random incorporation of foreign particles into a self&#8208;assembling host lattice. The random distribution of the binary particle types on the surface and within its bulk has been visualized using advanced transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The 20&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m sized binary mesocrystals have been further characterized through wide and small angle scattering techniques to reveal a long&#8208;range ordering on the atomic scale throughout the crystal while showing clear evidence that the material consists of individual building blocks. Through careful adjustments of the crystallization parameters, we could further obtain a reverse superstructure, where incorporated particles and host lattice switch roles.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Specific Targeting of Ibrutinib: Introducing Electrostatic Antibody&#8208;Inhibitor Conjugates (AiCs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo evaluation of a vesicular ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5 hosting nanocarrier is reported. In&#8197;vivo, it shows a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and gave a significantly better response at much lower dosage than the original untargeted drug.







Abstract
Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and is connected with toxicities. To minimize its toxicities, we linked ibrutinib to a cell&#8208;targeted, internalizing antibody. To this end, we synthesized a poly&#8208;anionic derivate, ibrutinib&#8208;Cy3.5, that retains full functionality. This anionic inhibitor is complexed by our anti&#8208;CD20&#8208;protamine targeting conjugate and free protamine, and thereby spontaneously assembles into an electrostatically stabilized vesicular nanocarrier. The complexation led to an accumulation of the drug driven by the CD20 antigen internalization to the intended cells and an amplification of its pharmacological effectivity. In&#8197;vivo, we observed a significant enrichment of the drug in xenograft lymphoma tumors in immune&#8208;compromised mice and a significantly better response to lower doses compared to the original drug.

         <title>Supernova: A Deoxyribozyme that Catalyzes a Chemiluminescent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial evolution was used to identify a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This catalyzes a chemiluminescent reaction in the presence of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star. Light production can also be coupled to ligand binding, suggesting that Supernova will be a useful addition to the toolkit of functional DNA parts.







Abstract
Functional DNA molecules are useful components in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. To expand the toolkit of functional DNA parts, in this study we used artificial evolution to identify a glowing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This deoxyribozyme transfers a phosphate from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate to its 5&#8242; hydroxyl group, which triggers a chemiluminescent reaction and a flash of blue light. An engineered version of Supernova is only catalytically active in the presence of an oligonucleotide complementary to its 3&#8242; end, demonstrating that light production can be coupled to ligand binding. We anticipate that Supernova will be useful in a wide variety of applications, including as a signaling component in allosterically regulated sensors and in logic gates of molecular computers.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Hydrophobicity for Ultrafast Oil&#8211;Water Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2D robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability were synthesized by introducing mixed hydrophobic substituents. After coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, the superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating exhibits an excellent oil/water separation efficiency (&gt;99.5&#8201;%), high oil&#8208;permeation flux (2.84&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, high water&#8208;pressure resistance (&gt;15&#8197;kPa), and a high degree of reusability (&gt;50&#8197;cycles).







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potentials for addressing the challenge of highly efficient oil&#8211;water separation, but they are restricted by the poor wettability and processability as crystalline membranes. Here we report the design and synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) robust COFs with controllable hydrophobicity and processability, allowing the COF layers to be directly grown on the support surfaces. Three 2D COFs with AA or ABC stacking are prepared by condensation of triamines with fluorine and/or isopropyl groups and perfluorodialdehyde. They all show excellent tolerance to water, acid, and base, with water contact angles (CA) of 111.5&#8211;145.8&#176;. The two COFs with isopropyl and fluorine mixtures can grow as a coating on a stainless&#8208;steel net (SSN) substrate, whereas the one with only fluorine substituents cannot. The superhydrophobic COF@SSN coating with water CA of up to 150.1&#176; displays high water&#8208;resistance and self&#8208;cleaning properties, enabling high oil&#8211;water separation performances with an efficiency of over 99.5&#8201;% and a permeation flux of 2.84&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, which are among the highest values reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Tardigrade Proteins Self&#8208;Assemble into Fibrous Gels in Response to Environmental Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational behaviour of an intrinsically disordered protein responsible for protecting tardigrades against extreme stress has been characterized. The protein assembles into fibres and fibrillar gels as a function of temperature and concentration. The disordered tails remain flexible within the gel cavities, which can encapsulate client proteins in their native state.







Abstract
Tardigrades are remarkable for their ability to survive harsh stress conditions as diverse as extreme temperature and desiccation. The molecular mechanisms that confer this unusual resistance to physical stress remain unknown. Recently, tardigrade&#8208;unique intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to play an essential role in tardigrade anhydrobiosis. Here, we characterize the conformational and physical behaviour of CAHS&#8208;8 from Hypsibius&#8197;exemplaris. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the protein comprises an extended central helical domain flanked by disordered termini. Upon concentration, the protein is shown to successively form oligomers, long fibres, and finally gels constituted of fibres in a strongly temperature&#8208;dependent manner. The helical domain forms the core of the fibrillar structure, with the disordered termini remaining highly dynamic within the gel. Soluble proteins can be encapsulated within cavities in the gel, maintaining their functional form. The ability to reversibly form fibrous gels may be associated with the enhanced protective properties of these proteins.

         <title>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis by Programmed Disassembly of Reticular Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a new approach to synthesizing molecules and materials based on the programmed de&#8208;reticulation and controlled etching at the molecular level in reticular materials, is introduced. Using this strategy, we have transformed two 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into two topologically distinct 3D MOFs, and one metal&#8208;organic polyhedra into a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle.







Abstract
Bond breaking is an essential process in chemical transformations and the ability of researchers to strategically dictate which bonds in a given system will be broken translates to greater synthetic control. Here, we report extending the concept of selective bond breaking to reticular materials in a new synthetic approach that we call Clip&#8208;off Chemistry. We show that bond&#8208;breaking in these structures can be controlled at the molecular level; is periodic, quantitative, and selective; is effective in reactions performed in either solid or liquid phases; and can occur in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion involving the entire bulk precursor sample. We validate Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by synthesizing two topologically distinct 3D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from two reported 3D MOFs, and a metal&#8208;organic macrocycle from metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP). Clip&#8208;off Chemistry opens the door to the programmed disassembly of reticular materials and thus to the design and synthesis of new molecules and materials.

While the reaction of the [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] template with Cu+ or Ag+ produces Cu12H2 and AgCu14H2 species in which the hydrides behave as Lewis bases, in the reaction with Au+, the hydrides act as reducing agents, leading to a luminescent, two&#8208;electron Au@Cu11 superatom, whose metal core has a defect fcc structure.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to surface hydrides, reactivities of interstitial hydrides are difficult to explore. When treated with a metal ion (Cu+, Ag+, and Au+), the stable CuI dihydride template [Cu11H2{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3] (H2Cu11) generates surprisingly three very different compounds, namely [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (1), [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6((C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (2), and [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (3). Compounds 1 and 2 are both MI species and maintain the same number of hydride ligands as their H2Cu11 precursor. Neutron diffraction revealed the first time a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal hydride coordination mode in the AgCu3 environment of 2. 3 has no hydride and exhibits a mixed&#8208;valent [AuCu11]10+ metal core, making it a two&#8208;electron superatom.

         <title>Unravelling of a [High Spin&#8212;Low Spin] &#8596; [Low Spin&#8212;High Spin] Equilibrium in Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron(II) Dinuclear Helicates Using Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a binuclear complex with two spin crossover active ions, at least three different states are possible: fully high&#8208;spin [HS&#8208;HS] or low&#8208;spin [LS&#8208;LS] states that are commonly encountered and a relatively unusual intermediate [HS&#8208;LS] state. The binuclear iron(II) helicates show the exchange dynamics [HS&#8208;LS] &#8596; [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale in such a broken&#8208;symmetry state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states of selected transition metal ions in polynuclear and polymeric compounds is behind their use as multistep switchable materials in breakthrough electronic and spintronic devices. We report the first successful attempt to observe the dynamics of a rarely found broken&#8208;symmetry spin state in binuclear complexes, which mixes the states [HS&#8208;LS] and [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale. The slow exchange between these two states, which was identified by paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy in solutions of two spin&#8208;crossover iron(II) binuclear helicates that are amenable to molecular design, opens a path to double quantum dot cellular automata for information storage and processing.

         <title>Correlating Reaction Dynamics and Size Change during the Photomechanical Transformation of 9&#8208;Methylanthracene Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a nonlinear kinetic model for crystal reactions allows us to quantify for the first time how the kinetics depend on sample morphology. Furthermore, the quantitative connection between molecular reaction kinetics and mechanical response in well&#8208;defined single crystals provides a new benchmark for analyzing these photomechanical materials.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals that expand under illumination could potentially be used as photon&#8208;powered actuators. In this study, we find that the use of high&#8208;quality single crystals of 9&#8208;methylanthracene (9MA) leads to more homogeneous reaction kinetics than that previously seen for polycrystalline samples, presumably due to a lower concentration of defects. Furthermore, simultaneous observation of absorbance and shape changes in single crystals revealed that the dimensional change mirrors the reaction progress, resulting in a smooth expansion of 7&#8201;% along the c&#8208;axis that is linearly correlated with reaction progress. The same expansion dynamics are highly reproducible across different single crystal samples. Organic single crystals exhibit well&#8208;defined linear expansions during 100&#8201;% photoconversion, suggesting that this class of solid&#8208;state phase change material could be used for actuation.

         <title>Vacancy Modulating Co3Sn2S2 Topological Semimetal for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 cathode was applied in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries with a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. Co3Sn1.8S2 activates Sn2+ and provides active sites with impressive charge&#8208;storage capabilities and fast kinetic processes. The material has high structural stability and conductivity, and an ionic diffusion rate that achieves appreciable cycling stability and capacity retention.







Abstract
Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with high electrical conductivity and suitable carrier density near the Fermi level are enticing candidates for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), meriting from topological surface states (TSSs). We propose a WSM Co3Sn2S2 cathode for AZIBs showing a discharge plateau around 1.5&#8197;V. By introducing Sn vacancies, extra redox peaks from the Sn4+/Sn2+ transition appear, which leads to more Zn2+ transfer channels and active sites promoting charge&#8208;storage kinetics and Zn2+ storage capability. Co3Sn1.8S2 achieves a specific energy of 305&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (0.2 Ag&#8722;1) and a specific power of 4900&#8197;Wkg&#8722;1 (5 Ag&#8722;1). Co3Sn1.8S2 and ZnxCo3Sn1.8S2 benefit from better conductivity at lower temperatures; the quasi&#8208;solid Co3Sn1.8S2//Zn battery delivers 126&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.6 Ag&#8722;1) at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and a cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles (2 Ag&#8722;1) with 85&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Defective Nanotube Molecule of C552H496N24 with Pyridinic and Pyrrolic Nitrogen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gigantic molecule composed of 1072 atoms was designed and synthesized to install two types of nitrogen dopants in a defective nanotube molecule. Charge&#8208;transfer interactions originating from the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen dopants were disclosed by solution&#8208;phase analyses, and 3&#8208;nm molecular structures and a unique helical assembly were revealed by crystallographic analyses.







Abstract
A 3&#8208;nm molecule comprising a cylindrical core and cross&#8208;shaped rims was designed and synthesized by developing a modular synthetic route. By using a cyclic precursor from previous studies as a starting material, multiple carbazole units were installed at the rims of the defective cylinder. The defective cylinder was synthetically doped with two types of nitrogen atoms, that is, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, which resulted in solvatochromic shifts in fluorescence by charge&#8208;transfer interactions. The structure of the large, C552H496N24 molecule was fully disclosed by crystallographic analyses, and the unique helical arrangement of nitrogen&#8208;doped cylinders in the crystal was revealed.

         <title>Clinical Development of Metal Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy has complemented traditional cancer treatment modalities. Despite its success, the clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal. To overcome their limitations increasing research efforts have been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. In this Minireview, the clinical status of metal&#8208;containing compounds as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy is reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer has emerged over the last decades as one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the most commonly used techniques (i.e. surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy), increasing attention has been devoted towards photodynamic therapy. However, the vast majority of clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal and associated with several limitations including poor aqueous solubility, poor photostability and slow clearance from the body, causing photosensitivity. In an effort to overcome these drawbacks, much attention has been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. Herein, the clinical development of metal&#8208;containing compounds including Purlytin&#174;, Lutrin&#174;/Antrin&#174;, Photosens&#174;, TOOKAD&#174; soluble or TLD&#8208;1433 is critically reviewed.

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Controllable Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azoxybenzenes, Azobenzenes and Nitrosobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 can catalyze the selective oxidation of anilines to azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes and nitrosobenzenes for a wide range of substrates. Control experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the activation of H2O2 and O2 can be attributed to the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of aniline to metastable and valuable azoxybenzene, azobenzene or nitrosobenzene has important practical significance in organic synthesis. However, uncontrollable selectivity and laborious synthesis of the expensive required catalysts severely hinders the uptake of these reactions in industrial settings. Herein, we have pioneered the discovery of Zr(OH)4 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst capable of the selective oxidation of aniline, using either peroxide or O2 as oxidant, to selectively obtain various azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes, as well as nitrosobenzenes, by simply regulating the reaction solvent, without the need for additives. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of H2O2 and O2 is primarily achieved by the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)4, respectively. The present work provides an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for the selective oxidation of aniline in industrial applications.

         <title>Dual Nanoislands on Ni/C Hybrid Nanosheet Activate Superior Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Efficiency H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array with dual&#8208;active nanoisland sites is reported. One type of island represents the bare Ni particle surface, the other consists of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structures (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA). The catalyst achieves efficient hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Clean hydrogen evolution through electrochemical water splitting underpins various innovative approaches to the pursuit of sustainable energy conversion technologies, but it is blocked by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) has been considered as one of the most promising substitute for OER to improve the efficiency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we construct novel dual nanoislands on Ni/C hybrid nanosheet array: one kind of island represents the part of bare Ni particle surface, while the other stands for the part of core&#8211;shell Ni@C structure (denoted as Ni&#8208;C HNSA), in which exposed Ni atoms and Ni&#8208;decorated carbon shell perform as active sites for HzOR and HER respectively. As a result, when the current density reaches 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the working potentials are merely &#8722;37&#8197;mV for HER and &#8208;20 mV for HzOR. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer exhibits superb activity that only requires an ultrasmall cell voltage of 0.14&#8197;V to achieve 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Structure of an Atomically Dispersed Zinc Electrocatalyst: Coordination Environment Regulation for High Selectivity Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible alteration of an 2&#8197;e&#8722;/4&#8197;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway was discovered by tuning the coordination environment of Zn single sites derived from MOF&#8208;5 by varying the functional group of ligands within the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursors. The formed ZnN4 follows a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway, while ZnO3C achieves a maximum H2O2 production rate of 340&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Accurately regulating the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to renewable energy storage and utilization, but challenging. A flexible alteration of ORR pathways on atomically dispersed Zn sites towards high selectivity ORR can be achieved by tailoring the coordination environment of the catalytic centers. The atomically dispersed Zn catalysts with unique O&#8208; and C&#8208;coordination structure (ZnO3C) or N&#8208;coordination structure (ZnN4) can be prepared by varying the functional groups of corresponding MOF precursors. The coordination environment of as&#8208;prepared atomically dispersed Zn catalysts was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFs). Notably, the ZnN4 catalyst processes a 4&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O. However, controllably tailoring the coordination environment of atomically dispersed Zn sites, ZnO3C catalyst processes a 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR pathway to generate H2O2 with a near zero overpotential and high selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Calculations reveal that decreased electron density around Zn in ZnO3C lowers the d&#8208;band center of Zn, thus changing the intermediate adsorption and contributing to the high selectivity towards 2&#8197;e&#8722; ORR.

         <title>An Exceptional Thermally Induced Four&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch Arising from Stepwise Molecular Dynamic Changes in a New Hybrid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple hybrid salt has been synthesized that exhibits reversible multistep phase transitions and an unprecedented thermally induced three&#8208;step &#8220;silent&#8208;medium&#8208;low&#8208;high&#8221; second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation switching behavior. This behavior arises from complex and stepwise molecular dynamic changes of the polar organic cations.







Abstract
Switching materials in channels of nonlinear optics (NLOs) are of particular interest in NLO material science. Numerous crystalline NLO switches based on structural phase transition have emerged, but most of them reveal a single&#8208;step switch between two different second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) states, and only very rare cases involve three or more SHG states. Herein, we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid salt, (Me3NNH2)2[CdI4], which is an unprecedented case of a reversible three&#8208;step NLO switch between SHG&#8208;silent, &#8208;medium, &#8208;low, and &#8208;high states, with high contrasts of 25.5/4.3/9.2 in a temperature range of 213&#8211;303&#8197;K. By using the combined techniques of variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses, dielectric constants, solid&#8208;state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Hirshfeld surface analyses, we disclose that this four&#8208;state switchable SHG behavior is highly associated with the stepwise&#8208;changed molecular dynamics of the polar organic cations. This finding demonstrates well the complexity of molecular dynamics in simple hybrid salts and their potential in designing new advanced multistep switching materials.

         <title>Mechanochemically Synthesised Flexible Electrodes Based on Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Glasses for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Co&#8211;Fe MOF glass was fabricated via post&#8208;synthetic adsorption of ferric coordination complex on ZIF&#8208;62(Co) followed by vitrification. The presence of bi&#8208;metal ions within the framework significantly improved the catalytic performance of the MOF glass. Then durable MOF glass electrodes were fabricated with ball milling for scalable electrocatalytic devices.







Abstract
The melting behaviour of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has aroused significant research interest in the areas of materials science, condensed matter physics and chemical engineering. This work first introduces a novel method to fabricate a bimetallic MOF glass, through melt&#8208;quenching of the cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [ZIF&#8208;62(Co)] with an adsorbed ferric coordination complex. The high&#8208;temperature chemically reactive ZIF&#8208;62(Co) liquid facilitates the formation of coordinative bonds between Fe and imidazolate ligands, incorporating Fe nodes into the framework after quenching. The resultant Co&#8211;Fe bimetallic MOF glass therefore shows a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance. The novel bimetallic MOF glass, when combined with the facile and scalable mechanochemical synthesis technique for both discrete powders and surface coatings on flexible substrates, enables significant opportunities for catalytic device assembly.

         <title>Clippane: A Mechanically Interlocked Molecule (MIM) Based on Molecular Tweezers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new type of MIM comprised by two &#8220;open&#8221; U&#8208;shaped metallotweezers. The dissociation into its two components is hampered by mechanical bonds, as the presence of bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups provides the mechanical coercion required for avoiding the slippage that would otherwise produce the disassembly.







Abstract
In this study we report the preparation of a new mechanically interlocked molecule formed by the self&#8208;aggregation of two metallotweezers composed by two pyrene&#8208;imidazolylidene gold(I) arms and a pyridine&#8208;centered pentacyclic bis&#8208;alkynyl linker. The mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule arises from the presence of the bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups attached to the sides of the pyrene moieties of the arms of the tweezer, which act as stoppers avoiding the dissociation of the self&#8208;aggregated metallotweezer dimer once it is formed. By combining experimental techniques, we were able to confirm the mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule in solution, in the gas phase and in the solid state. The behavior of the tert&#8208;butyl substituted tweezer differs greatly form that shown by the tweezer lacking of these bulky groups, whose dimeric structure is in equilibrium with the monomeric structure, therefore not showing any mechanical coercion that avoids the disassembly of the self&#8208;aggregated structure.

         <title>Construction of NH&#8208;Unprotected Spiropyrrolidines and Spiroisoindolines by [4+1] Cyclizations of &#947;&#8208;Azidoboronic Acids with Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylhydrazones</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones of cyclic ketones are readily transformed into NH&#8208;free spirocyclic pyrrolidines and isoindolines by reaction with &#947;&#8208;azidoboronic acids. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free transformation is widely applicable and represents a new disconnection towards spirocyclic pyrrolidines. The application of the reaction in the modification of natural steroids and other biorelevant molecules highlights the synthetic usefulness of the methodology.







Abstract
The reactions of N&#8208;sulfonylhydrazones derived from cyclic ketones with &#947;&#8208;azidopropylboronic acid and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenylboronic acid give rise to spirocyclic pyrrolidines and spiroisoindolines, respectively. The reactions proceed without the need of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst through a domino process that comprises the formation of a Csp3&#8208;C and a Csp3&#8208;N bond of the former hydrazonic carbon. The scope of the reaction has been explored by the preparation of over 50 examples of NH&#8208;unprotected spirocyclic derivatives. Importantly, this methodology could be applied for the preparation of alkaloid steroids from steroid N&#8208;tosylhydrazones.

         <title>A Striking Mode of Activation of Carbon Disulfide with a Cooperative Bis(silylene)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected new type of cooperativity of the two silicon(II) atoms in a 1,4&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;bridged bis(silylene) towards CS2 is reported and the results are compared with that of related mono&#8208;silylenes. While a dearomatization occurs with the bis&#8208;silylene, a novel mesoionic five&#8208;membered Si2S2C heterocyclic compound, among other new products, results from stepwise degradation of CS2 with mono&#8208;silylenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;substituted bis(silylenyl)terphenylene 1, 1,4&#8208;[ortho&#8208;(LSi)C6H4]2C6H4, (L=RC(NtBu)2, R=Ph, Mes) towards CS2 is reported. It results in a dearomatization of the phenylene ring, affording the 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclohexadiene derivative 2. According to DFT calculations, a transient silene containing a Si=C bond capable of &#960;(C=C) addition at the aromatic phenylene ring is a key intermediate. In contrast, addition of CS2 to the biphenyl&#8208;substituted mono&#8208;silylene ortho&#8208;(LSi)C6H4&#8208;C6H5 3 leaves the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system intact and forms, in a [1+2] cycloaddition reaction, the corresponding thiasilirane 4 with a three&#8208;membered SiSC ring. Further experimental studies led to the isolation of the novel mesoionic five&#8208;membered Si2S2C heterocycle 6, which reacts with CS2 under C&#8722;C bond formation. All isolated new compounds were fully characterized and their molecular structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

While a dearomatization occurs with the bis-silylene, a novel mesoionic five-membered Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C heterocyclic compound, among other new products, results from stepwise degradation of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with mono-silylenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of the 1,4-substituted bis(silylenyl)terphenylene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 1,4-[&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(LSi)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (L=RC(NtBu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, R=Ph, Mes) towards CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. It results in a dearomatization of the phenylene ring, affording the 1,3-substituted cyclohexadiene derivative &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. According to DFT calculations, a transient silene containing a Si=C bond capable of &#960;(C=C) addition at the aromatic phenylene ring is a key intermediate. In contrast, addition of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the biphenyl-substituted mono-silylene &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(LSi)C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; leaves the aromatic &#960;-system intact and forms, in a [1+2] cycloaddition reaction, the corresponding thiasilirane &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with a three-membered SiSC ring. Further experimental studies led to the isolation of the novel mesoionic five-membered Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C heterocycle &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, which reacts with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under C&#8722;C bond formation. All isolated new compounds were fully characterized and their molecular structures determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimide&#8208;based COFs were synthesized via a geomimetic hydrothermal reaction, yielding materials having various pore dimensions and crystal structures. The solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the growth mechanism and reaction pathway, which determined the 3D stacking structures of the polyimide&#8208;based COFs.







Abstract
Despite its abundance, water is not widely used as a medium for organic reactions. However, under geothermal conditions, water exhibits unique physicochemical properties, such as viscosity and a dielectric constant, and the ionic product become similar to those of common organic solvents. We have synthesized highly crystalline polyimide&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PICs) under geomimetic hydrothermal conditions. By exploiting triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexacarboxylic acid in combination with various aromatic diamines, PICs with various pore dimensions and crystallinities were synthesized. XRD, FT&#8208;IR, and DFT calculations revealed that the solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the stacking structures of the crystalline PICs. Furthermore, the synthesized PICs demonstrate promising potential as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its unique redox&#8208;active properties and high surface area.

         <title>Discovery and Mechanism of Action of Small Molecule Inhibitors of Ceramidases**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of synthetic fluorescent ceramide molecules allows the discovery of the first selective drug&#8208;like small molecule inhibitors for alkaline ceramidase 3, an intra&#8208;membrane enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism in health and disease. These inhibitors represent a new paradigm for controlling lipid metabolism with drug&#8208;like small molecules targeting conformationally dynamic membrane proteins.







Abstract
Sphingolipid metabolism is tightly controlled by enzymes to regulate essential processes in human physiology. The central metabolite is ceramide, a pro&#8208;apoptotic lipid catabolized by ceramidase enzymes to produce pro&#8208;proliferative sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate. Alkaline ceramidases are transmembrane enzymes that recently attracted attention for drug development in fatty liver diseases. However, due to their hydrophobic nature, no specific small molecule inhibitors have been reported. We present the discovery and mechanism of action of the first drug&#8208;like inhibitors of alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). In particular, we chemically engineered novel fluorescent ceramide substrates enabling screening of large compound libraries and characterized enzyme:inhibitor interactions using mass spectrometry and MD simulations. In addition to revealing a new paradigm for inhibition of lipid metabolising enzymes with non&#8208;lipidic small molecules, our data lay the ground for targeting ACER3 in drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Energy Band Alignment and Redox&#8208;Active Sites in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Spaced Metal&#8208;Catechol Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hydro&#8208;stable metalloporphyrin&#8208;bridged metal&#8208;phenate frameworks are constructed, which exhibit artificial photosynthetic activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation without photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. Activity is boosted by substitution of the Fe&#8208;oxo chain for an In&#8208;oxo chain, and further enhanced by addition of the uncoordinated hydroxyl groups of catechol into the scaffold.







Abstract
Two new chemically stable metalloporphyrin&#8208;bridged metal&#8208;catechol frameworks, InTCP&#8208;Co and FeTCP&#8208;Co, were constructed to achieve artificial photosynthesis without additional sacrificial agents and photosensitizers. The CO2 photoreduction rate over FeTCP&#8208;Co considerably exceeds that obtained over InTCP&#8208;Co, and the incorporation of uncoordinated hydroxyl groups, associated with catechol, into the network further promotes the photocatalytic activity. The iron&#8208;oxo coordination chain assists energy band alignment and provides a redox&#8208;active site, and the uncoordinated hydroxyl group contributes to the visible&#8208;light absorptance, charge&#8208;carrier transfer, and CO2&#8208;scaffold affinity. With a formic acid selectivity of 97.8&#8201;%, FeTCP&#8208;OH&#8208;Co affords CO2 photoconversion with a reaction rate 4.3 and 15.7 times higher than those of FeTCP&#8208; Co and InTCP&#8208;Co, respectively. These findings are also consistent with the spectroscopic study and DFT calculation.

         <title>Labile Photo&#8208;Induced Free Radical in &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutaric Acid: a Universal Endogenous Polarizing Agent for In&#8197;Vivo Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) has an exceptionally high free radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation at cryogenic temperature. This radical can be used as a universal polarizing agent to hyperpolarize 13C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;13C]lactate, a promising alternative to pyruvate for in vivo metabolic studies by 13C magnetic resonance.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance enables non&#8208;invasive probing of metabolism in vivo. To date, only 13C&#8208;molecules hyperpolarized with persistent trityl radicals have been injected in humans. We show here that the free radical photo&#8208;induced in alpha&#8208;ketoglutaric acid (&#945;&#8208;KG) can be used to hyperpolarize photo&#8208;inactive 13C&#8208;molecules such as [1&#8208;13C]lactate. &#945;&#8208;KG is an endogenous molecule with an exceptionally high radical yield under photo&#8208;irradiation, up to 50&#8201;%, and its breakdown product, succinic acid, is also endogenous. This radical precursor therefore exhibits an excellent safety profile for translation to human studies. The labile nature of the radical means that no filtration is required prior to injection while also offering the opportunity to extend the 13C relaxation time in frozen HP 13C&#8208;molecules for storage and transport. The potential for in vivo metabolic studies is demonstrated in the rat liver following the injection of a physiological dose of HP [1&#8208;13C]lactate.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Engineering over Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Structured Copper towards Efficient Electrocatalytical C&#8208;C coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement provides a promising solution to promote electrocatalytic C&#8208;C coupling, by dramatically altering the diffusion kinetics to ensure a high local concentration of C1&#160;intermediates for carbon dimerization. Herein, under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method simulations&#160;results, a series of Cu2O hollow multi&#8208;shell structures (HoMSs) with tunable shell numbers were synthesized via Ostwald ripening. When applied in CO2&#160;electroreduction (CO2RR), the in&#8208;situ formed Cu HoMSs showed a positive correlation between shell numbers and selectivity for C2+&#160;products, reaching a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3% at a conversion rate of 513.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.7 mA cm&#8208;2 in neutral electrolyte.&#160;Mechanism studies clarified the confinement effect of HoMSs that superposition of Cu shells leads to a higher coverage of localized CO adsorbate inside the cavity for enhanced dimerization. This work provides valuable insights for delicate design of efficient C&#8208;C coupling catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8211;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8211;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8211;C bond formation with  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;  N  &#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8211;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering Chain Flexibility of Aliphatic Polyesters for Yellow&#8208;green Clusteroluminescence in 38% Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of non&#8208;conjugated polymers with long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield (QY) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report the first example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8208;green clusteroluminescence (CL) and a high QY of 38%. We discovered that the polyester P3 with balanced flexibility and rigidity showed the longest CL wavelength and highest QY. Systematically photophysical characterization unravel the key role of ester cluster in the CL and the cluster formation via the aggregate of ester units was visualized. Moreover, P3 was demonstrated to be a highly selective, quick&#8208;responsive (~1.2 min) and sensitive detector (detection limit is 0.78 &#956;M) for irons owing to the fast disassociation of clusters by irons. This work not only gains further mechanistic insight into CL but also provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;wavelength CL, meanwhile, enlightens the glorious application prospect of luminescent polyester.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Natural Peptide Ligands to the Neuropeptide Y5 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The binding mode of natural peptide ligands to the Y  5  G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (Y  5  R), an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, is largely unknown. Here, we apply complementary biochemical and computational approaches, including scanning of the receptor surface with a genetically encoded crosslinker, Ala&#8208;scanning of the ligand and double&#8208;cycle mutagenesis, to map interactions in the ligand&#8208;receptor interface. We incorporate the experimental data into a structural model of the NPY&#8208;Y  5  R complex. In the model, the carboxyl (C)&#8208;terminus of bound NPY is placed close to the extracellular loop (ECL)&#160;3, whereas the characteristic &#945;&#8208;helical segment of the ligand drapes over ECL1 and is tethered towards ECL2 by a hydrophobic cluster. We further show that the other two natural ligands of Y  5  R, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) dock to the receptor in a similar pose.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing hydrogen binding on Ru sites with RuCo alloy nanosheets for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, with considerable performance and desirable cost, become highly concerned candidates to replace platinum (Pt) in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The hydrogen binding at Ru sites (Ru&#8208;H) is an important factor limiting the HER activity. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the essence of Ru&#8208;H binding energy is the strong interaction between the 4dz  2  orbital of Ru and 1s orbital of H. The charge transfer between Ru sites and substrates (Co and Ni) causes the appropriate downward shift of the 4dz  2  &#8208;band center of Ru, which results in a Gibbs free energy of 0.022 eV for H* in RuCo system, much decrease compared to 0.133 eV in pure Ru system. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally confirmed using RuCo alloy nanosheets (RuCo ANSs). They were prepared via fast co&#8208;precipitation method followed with a mild electrochemical reduction. Structure characterizations reveal that the Ru atoms are embed into Co substrate as isolated active sites with the planar symmetric and Z&#8208;direction asymmetric coordination structure, obtaining an optimal 4dz  2  modulated electronic structure. Hydrogen sensor and temperature program desorption (TPD) tests demonstrate the enhanced Ru&#8208;H interactions in RuCo ANSs than pure Ru nanoparticles. As a result, the RuCo ANSs reach an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA/cm  2  and a Tafel slope of 20.6 mV/dec in 1 M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C. This holistic work provides a new insight to promote alkaline HER by optimizing metal&#8208;H binding energy of active sites.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A strategy to control the diastereoselectivity of bond formation at a prochiral attached&#8208;ring bridgehead is reported. An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control&#160;re&#8208;&#160;vs.&#160;si&#8208;&#160;facial selectivity en route to fully&#8208;substituted attached&#8208;rings.

The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8208;E&#8208;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic E  II  centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH  3  . Further, the Ge  II  centre in  4a/b  readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF  6  ]  &#8208;  to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex  PhR  DippGe(F)Ni(PPh  3  )  3  9  , despite this Ge  II  centre simultaneously being a  &#963;  &#8208;donating ligand towards Ni  0  . Alongside the observed catalytic ability of  4  and  5  in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic kinetic sensitization of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds &#8211; Access to medium&#8208;sized rings via a De Mayo&#8208;type ring expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated two&#8208;carbon ring expansion of  &#946;  &#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with unactivated olefins providing facile access to medium&#8208;sized rings. Selective sensitization of the substoichiometric enol tautomer enables reactivity with substrates incompatible with the classical De Mayo&#8208;reaction conditions. Key to success is the identification of the metal&#8208;based sensitizer  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ], which possesses a high triplet excited state energy of 73.3 kcal mol  &#8211;1  . This exactly falls in the range between the triplet energies of the enol and keto tautomer, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic sensitization. Demonstrating the applicability of  fac  &#8208;[Ir(CF  3  &#8208;pmb)  3  ] as a photocatalyst in organic synthesis for the first time, we describe a two&#8208;step photocycloaddition&#8208;ring&#8208;opening cascade with  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, &#8208;diketones and &#8208;ketoamides.

         <dc:description>A fully conjugated figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight nanohoop is presented with facile synthesis. The molecule&#8217;s lemniscular skeleton features the combination of two strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene core. Its rigid yet guest&#8208;adaptive cavities enable the formation of the peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes with C  60  or C  70  , which have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterized in solution. Further computational studies suggest notable geometric variations and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cavities upon binding with different fullerenes, as well as the overall conjugation comparable to cycloparaphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Pairing in the Mordenite Framework as a Function of the CuI/CuII Speciation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25891-25896, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As evidenced by advanced X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis, Cu&#8208;pairing in copper&#8208;exchanged mordenite is favored by the +2 oxidation state. The optimal Cu&#8211;Cu distance in the oxidized state favors the formation of dimeric mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper sites.







Abstract
A series of gas&#8208;phase reactants is used to treat a Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolite with the aim of studying the influence of the reaction environment on the formation of Cu pairs. The rearrangement of Cu ions to form multimeric sites as a function of their oxidation state was probed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and also by applying advanced analysis through wavelet transform, a method able to specifically locate Cu&#8211;Cu interactions also in the presence of overlapping contributions from other scattering paths. The nature of the Cu&#8208;oxo species formed upon oxidation was further crosschecked by DFT&#8208;assisted fitting of the EXAFS data and by resonant Raman spectroscopy. Altogether, the CuI/CuII speciation clearly correlates with Cu proximity, with metal ion pairs quantitatively forming under an oxidative environment.

         <title>The Unusual Conductivity of Na+ in PEO&#8208;Based Statistical Copolymer Solid Electrolytes: When Less Means More</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25897-25904, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid polymer electrolytes from synthesized statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were mixed with various amounts of NaClO4. Physical crosslinking with cations is more prone to happen at high contents in both salt and comonomers, reducing the ionic conductivity. Low salt content (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) is thus preferred, contrasting with classical Nernstian behavior, leading to ionic conductivity of 0.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The low conductivity of Na+ electrolytes in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) curtails the development of Na polymer batteries. In this study, NaClO4 (3&#8211;24&#8197;wt&#8201;%, 90&#8211;9:1 O:Na) is dissolved in statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) (0&#8211;20&#8197;mol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the conductivity of these SPEs increases as the concentration of Na+ decreases, thus departing from the usual Nernstian behavior. Using a combination of calorimetric measurements and molecular dynamic simulations, this unusual phenomenon is attributed to the presence of physical cross&#8208;links generated by Na+. As a result, polymers containing a low salt concentration (3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) display a drastically enhanced ionic conductivity (up to 0.2 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), thus paving the way for the design of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO&#8208;based sodium batteries operational at room temperature.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Neutralization Assay Using Single Molecule Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25966-25972, December 1, 2021. </description>

Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed a simple neutralization assay based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. This assay can assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. We used this assay to profile neutralization capacity in patients infected with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and vaccinated individuals and show that this assay is useful for various clinical applications.







Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time and show that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals.

     alt="A SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Assay Using Single Molecule Arrays"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed a simple neutralization assay based on antibody-mediated blockage of the ACE2-spike interaction. This assay can assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. We used this assay to profile neutralization capacity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated individuals and show that this assay is useful for various clinical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody-mediated blockage of the ACE2-spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID-19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time and show that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS-CoV-2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre-pandemic healthy, COVID-19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

By employing (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes with N&#8208;sulfinylamines and sulfur diimides, a variety of isothiazolidines and thiazinanes were synthesized. Use of a sulfinylamine bearing a leaving group, followed by oxidation, led to formal insertion of HNSO2 providing &#947;&#8208;sultams with no N&#8208;substitution.







Abstract
We present (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloadditions of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes with N&#8208;sulfinylamines and a sulfur diimide, along with a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the formal insertion of HNSO2 into D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. These are rare examples of cycloadditions with D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes whereby the 2&#960; component consists of two different heteroatoms, thus leading to five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings containing adjacent heteroatoms.

         <title>Enantiopure C5 Pentaindenocorannulenes: Chiral Graphenoid Materials</title>

Four chiral C5 bowl&#8208;shaped aromatic hydrocarbons with exceptional configurational stability derived from pentaindenocorannulene synthesized. The chirality of these carbon bowls is instrumental to establishing the formation of columnar supramolecular assemblies in solution.







Abstract
Chiral carbon nanomaterials offer numerous prospects for material science. As a fundamental building block for non&#8208;planar graphenoid materials, pentaindenocorannulene (PIC) with its C5v symmetrical structure presents a platform for creation of supramolecular chiral carbon materials. Specifically, when uniformly penta&#8208;substituted on its periphery, PIC generates C5 symmetrical chiral buckybowls capable of columnar stacking. The synthesis and resolution of such PICs are achieved, assignment of absolute configuration is established by comparison of ECD and VCD spectra with theory, and material characterization is reported. Evidence for columnar stacking in solution and in the crystal is presented.

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations: Insights for Improved Designs**

Multiscale simulations unveil the binding and reaction mechanism of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231 inhibitor. This compound contains a hydroxymethyl group that plays a relevant role in the formation of the noncovalent and covalent complexes. In silico modifications show a possible strategy for the design of new inhibitors.







Abstract
We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8211;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with interactions similar to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8242; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8242; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a chloromethyl substituent to the P1&#8242; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition

         <title>Using Stereochemistry to Control Mechanical Properties in Thiol&#8211;Yne Click&#8208;Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25856-25864, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the stereochemistry of double bonds that are formed in situ using the nucleophilic thiol&#8211;yne addition enables the synthesis of robust hydrogels with mechanical properties that relate to the double bond stereochemistry. This approach allows the synthesis of hydrogels in which the other chemical and hence physical parameters remain the same providing a platform from which to isolate mechanical properties to direct cell differentiation.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of polymers has a profound impact on their mechanical properties. While this has been observed in thermoplastics, studies on how stereochemistry affects the bulk properties of swollen networks, such as hydrogels, are limited. Typically, changing the stiffness of a hydrogel is achieved at the cost of changing another parameter, that in turn affects the physical properties of the material and ultimately influences the cellular response. Herein, we report that by manipulating the stereochemistry of a double bond, formed in situ during gelation, materials with diverse mechanical properties but comparable physical properties can be obtained. Click&#8208;hydrogels that possess a high %&#8197;trans content are stiffer than their high %&#8197;cis analogues by almost a factor of&#8197;3. Human mesenchymal stem cells acted as a substrate stiffness cell reporter demonstrating the potential of these platforms to study mechanotransduction without the influence of other external factors.

         <title>SmCo5 with a Reconstructed Oxyhydroxide Surface for Spin&#8208;Selective Water Oxidation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25884-25890, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarized spins occurring at the ferromagnetic/oxyhydroxide interface of surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy led to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins were aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C (see picture).







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface&#8208;reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with a spin&#8208;pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications, electrolyzers are operated at elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this study, we prepared surface&#8208;reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy, which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that lead to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic the practical operation conditions of water electrolyzers. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>An Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Enhanced Li+ Transport Ability Enables Stable Li Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25973-25980, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Li deposition in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is achieved through introducing hydrofluoroether to regulate the solvation environment of electrolyte to boost Li+ transport ability according to the Sand formula. The formation of sliced ionic aggregate leads to the improved transport parameters in Sand formula. The performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte could endow Li&#8208;O2 batteries with low charging overpotential. However, their weak Li+ transport ability (LTA) leads to non&#8208;uniform Li deposition. Herein, guided by Sand formula, the LTA of TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is greatly enhanced to realize robust Li deposition through introducing hydrofluoroether (HFE) and optimizing electrolyte component ratios to regulate solvation environment. The solvation environment changes from Li(TFSI)2&#8722; ion pair into ionic aggregate clusters in the optimal electrolyte thanks to the slicing function of HFE toward ionic aggregate network. The transport parameters of Sand formula are synchronously enhanced, resulting in highly robust Li deposition behavior with greatly improved Coulombic efficiency (ca. 97.5&#8201;%) and cycling rate (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Cycling stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries was greatly improved (a tiny overpotential rise of 64&#8197;mV after 75&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8211;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25839-25845, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a mononuclear manganese complex, synchronous e&#8722; and H+ transfer occurred by a concerted pathway from spatially distinct sites to the reaction center (see scheme). By virtue of the multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) mechanism, this model complex lowered the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to approximately 20&#8197;mV when the weak acid phenol was used as a proton source.







Abstract
The active site of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (H2ase) is preorganized with an amine (azadithiolate) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir, which together lower the overpotential for proton reduction and hydrogen oxidation by multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET). Herein, we report a mononuclear manganese complex, fac&#8208;[Mn(CO)3(6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (1), as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H2ase. In 1, a redox&#8208;active bidentate ligand with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in the enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle, in each of which an electron stored in the reductive ligand and a proton at the proximal phenol moiety are transferred to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex 1 exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natural enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Dependent Transport in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Wires</title>

Magnetoresistance at room temperature is found in CoII and CuII metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular devices. The inversion of the magnetization of the Ni STM tip results in a change in the transport properties through the molecule. Such an effect appears for positive and negative bias. DFT&#8208;NEGF and TDDFT calculations were employed to explain the spin&#8208;polarization of the current.







Abstract
Here we present room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;dependent charge transport measurements in single&#8208;molecule junctions made of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies. They display large conductance switching for magnetoresistance in a single&#8208;molecule junction. The magnetoresistance depends acutely on the probed electron pathway through the supramolecular wire: those involving the metal center showed marked magnetoresistance effects as opposed to those exclusively involving the porphyrin ring which present nearly complete absence of spin&#8208;dependent charge transport. The molecular junction magnetoresistance is highly anisotropic, being observable when the magnetization of the ferromagnetic junction electrode is oriented along the main molecular junction axis, and almost suppressed when it is perpendicular. The key ingredients for the above effect to manifest are the electronic structure of the paramagnetic metalloporphyrin, and the spinterface created at the molecule&#8211;electrode contact.

         <title>Biomimetic Recognition of Quinones in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity with Anthracene Sidewalls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25981-25987, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new biomimetic host with anthracene sidewalls was constructed based on the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and by employing the synthetic strategy of simultaneous construction. This host is able to effectively bind quinones with high selectivity by employing shielded noncovalent interactions and the hydrophobic effect.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition in water is the foundation of numerous biological functions but is a challenge for most synthetic hosts. We employ the concept of endo&#8208;functionalized cavity and the strategy of simultaneous construction to address this issue. The concept and the strategy were demonstrated in the construction of a biomimetic host for selectively recognizing quinones in water. The host was synthesized by joining two pieces of bent anthracene dimer through amide bond formation, affording a deep hydrophobic cavity and inward&#8208;directing hydrogen bonding sites. The host can recognize quinones over their close analogues in water, and its association affinity to p&#8208;benzoquinone is the highest among all the known hosts and is even comparable to that of the bioreceptor. The binding with an anthraquinone reaches nanomolar affinity. Shielded hydrogen bonding, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect are responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity.

Shielded hydrogen bonding, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect are responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>

Experiments and calculations are presented to elucidate the mechanism of nanoconfinement and thermodynamic stabilization of AlH3 inside the pores of a bipyridine&#8208;functionalized cyclic triazine framework, CTF&#8208;bipyridine, which is responsible for the unprecedented reversibility of the hydride under 70&#8197;MPa hydrogen pressure at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The highly unfavorable thermodynamics of direct aluminum hydrogenation can be overcome by stabilizing alane within a nanoporous bipyridine&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework (AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine). This material and the counterpart AlH3@CTF&#8208;biphenyl rapidly desorb H2 between 95 and 154&#8201;&#176;C, with desorption complete at 250&#8201;&#176;C. Sieverts measurements, 27Al MAS NMR and 27Al{1H} REDOR experiments, and computational spectroscopy reveal that AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipyridine dehydrogenation is reversible at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, &gt;10 times lower pressure than that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum. DFT calculations and EPR measurements support an unconventional mechanism whereby strong AlH3 binding to bipyridine results in single&#8208;electron transfer to form AlH2(AlH3)n clusters. The resulting size&#8208;dependent charge redistribution alters the dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation thermochemistry, suggesting a novel strategy to enable reversibility in high&#8208;capacity metal hydrides.

         <title>Self&#8208;Metalation of Porphyrins at the Solid&#8211;Gas Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25988-25993, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic self&#8208;metalation of tetrapyrroles at surfaces can be promoted by oxygen at the solid&#8211;gas interface already at room temperature, lowering the reaction barrier as in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100).







Abstract
Self&#8208;metalation is a promising route to include a single metal atom in a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle in organic frameworks supported by metal surfaces. The molecule&#8211;surface interaction may provide the charge transfer and the geometric distortion of the molecular plane necessary for metal inclusion. However, at a metal surface the presence of an activation barrier can represent an obstacle that cannot be compensated by a higher substrate temperature without affecting the layer integrity. The formation of the intermediate state can be facilitated in some cases by oxygen pre&#8208;adsorption at the supporting metal surface, like in the case of 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100). In such cases, the activation barrier can be overcome by mild annealing, yielding the formation of desorbing products and of the metalated tetrapyrrole. We show here that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;TPP at the Pd(100) surface can be promoted already at room temperature by the presence of an oxygen gas phase at close&#8208;to&#8208;ambient conditions via an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism.

Crystallization&#8208;induced&#8208;emission AggRetina probe serves as a fluorescent polarity ruler to dissect the enriched heterogeneity inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
We report a crystallization&#8208;induced emission fluorophore to quantitatively interrogate the polarity of aggregated proteins. This solvatochromic probe, namely &#8220;AggRetina&#8221; probe, inherently binds to aggregated proteins and exhibits both a polarity&#8208;dependent fluorescence emission wavelength shift and a viscosity&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity increase. Regulation of its polarity sensitivity was achieved by extending the conjugation length. Different proteins bear diverse polarity upon aggregation, leading to different resistance to proteolysis. Polarity primarily decreases during protein misfolding but viscosity mainly increases upon the formation of insoluble aggregates. We quantified the polarity of aggregated protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest in live cells via HaloTag bioorthogonal labeling, revealing polarity heterogeneity within cellular aggregates. The enriched micro&#8208;environment details inside misfolded and aggregated proteins may correlate to their bio&#8208;chemical properties and pathogenicity.

The oxidation of physiologically stable diazaborines in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the key to the construction of ROS&#8208;responsive antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. These conjugates are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of therapeutics that combine the lethality of potent cytotoxic drugs with the targeting ability of antibodies to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells. In this study we show for the first time the synthesis of a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ADC (VL&#8208;DAB31&#8208;SN&#8208;38) that is highly selective and cytotoxic to B&#8208;cell lymphoma (CLBL&#8208;1 cell line, IC50 value of 54.1&#8197;nM). The synthesis of this ADC was possible due to the discovery that diazaborines (DABs) are a very effective ROS&#8208;responsive unit that are also very stable in buffer and in plasma. DFT calculations performed on this system revealed a favorable energetic profile (&#916;GR=&#8722;74.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) similar to the oxidation mechanism of aromatic boronic acids. DABs&#8217; very fast formation rate and modularity enabled the construction of different ROS&#8208;responsive linkers featuring self&#8208;immolative modules, bioorthogonal functions, and bioconjugation handles. These structures were used in the site&#8208;selective functionalization of a VL antibody domain and in the construction of the homogeneous ADC.

         <title>Noncovalent CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Phosphoramidite Palladium(II) Complexes with Strong Conformational Preference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25832-25838, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a combined NMR and computational study of a supramolecular balance to quantify ligand&#8211;ligand interactions in metal complexes and induce high heterocomplex preferences. Noncovalent interaction areas of flexible chiral phosphoramidite ligands are identified in palladium complexes with high conformational stability. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
The weak noncovalent interactions and flexibility of ligands play a key role in enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In transition metal complexes and their catalytic applications, the experimental assessment and the design of key interactions is as difficult as the prediction of the enantioselectivities, especially for flexible, privileged ligands such as chiral phosphoramidites. Therefore, the interligand interactions in cis&#8208;PdIIL2Cl2 phosphoramidite complexes were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and computations. We were able to induce a strong conformational preference by breaking the symmetry of the C2&#8208;symmetric side chain of one of the ligands, and shift the equilibrium between hetero&#8208; and homocomplexes towards heterocomplexes because of interligand interactions in the cis&#8208;complexes. The modulation of aryl substituents was exploited, along with the solvent effect. The combined CH&#8211;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25846-25855, December 1, 2021. </description>

We synthesized a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity, &#956;M affinities and high turn&#8208;on ratios. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.







Abstract
Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with Kd values ranging from 190&#8197;nM to 74&#8197;&#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn2+ co&#8208;released with insulin during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording of isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt;100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn2+ and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Sialylated Glycoforms of Human Erythropoietin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25922-25932, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two glycoforms of human erythropoietin (EPO) were synthesized by sequential native chemical ligation combining chemical and enzymatic methods. The sialylated glycoform EPO&#8197;S was assembled stepwise from sialoglycopeptides but more rapidly by direct sialylation of the asialo glycoform EPO&#8197;A. The native fold was evident from CD spectra, HR&#8208;MS, and binding to the human EPO receptor (EPOR).







Abstract
Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is the main therapeutic glycoprotein for the treatment of anemia in cancer and kidney patients. The in&#8208;vivo activity of EPO is carbohydrate&#8208;dependent with the number of sialic acid residues regulating its circulatory half&#8208;life. EPO carries three N&#8208;glycans and thus obtaining pure glycoforms provides a major challenge. We have developed a robust and reproducible chemoenzymatic approach to glycoforms of EPO with and without sialic acids. EPO was assembled by sequential native chemical ligation of two peptide and three glycopeptide segments. The glycopeptides were obtained by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury aspartylation. Enzymatic introduction of the sialic acids was readily accomplished at the level of the glycopeptide segments but even more efficiently on the refolded glycoprotein. Biological recognition of the synthetic EPOs was shown by formation of 1:1 complexes with recombinant EPO receptor.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25949-25957, December 1, 2021. </description>

A highly general and efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed radical hydroamination of alkenes with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide and its analogues has been developed. The corresponding asymmetric version has also been achieved by using a chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst in good to excellent level of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.

         <title>A Platform for Site&#8208;Specific DNA&#8208;Antibody Bioconjugation by Using Benzoylacrylic&#8208;Labelled Oligonucleotides</title>

BA&#8208;PFP is a simple and practical reagent that enables preparation of a range of diverse site&#8208;specific, homogenous DNA&#8208;protein/antibody bioconjugates under mild conditions. The generated constructs can be conveniently characterized by an optimized LC&#8208;MS method and utilized as probes for cell imaging using fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution DNA&#8208;PAINT microscopy.







Abstract
Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site&#8208;specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC&#8208;MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site&#8208;specific, well&#8208;defined and plasma&#8208;stable DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers from Amphiphilic Phosphodiester&#8208;Linked Azobenzene Trimers</title>

The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) of amphiphilic oligomers in aqueous medium is presented. Azobenzene&#8208;derived oligophosphates undergo morphological transformation upon light&#8208;triggered isomerization. In a reversible process, sheet&#8208;like SPs are switched to toroid&#8208;shaped objects by changing the configuration of the building blocks.







Abstract
An amphiphilic phosphodiester&#8208;linked azobenzene trimer has been exploited in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers. The trimer can reversibly undergo thermal and photoisomerization between Z&#8208; and E&#8208;isomers. Its self&#8208;assembly properties in aqueous medium have been investigated by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, demonstrating that E&#8208; and Z&#8208;azobenzene trimers form supramolecular nanosheets and toroidal nanostructures, respectively. By virtue of the E/Z photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, the two different supramolecular morphologies can be switched by photoirradiation. The findings pave a way towards stimuli&#8208;responsive, water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers which hold great promise in the development of smart functional materials.

         <title>Characterizing the Conformational Distribution in an Amorphous Film of an Organic Emitter and Its Application in a &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25878-25883, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Until now, the influence of the conformational distribution on the photophysics and device performance of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has not been clear. Herein, conformational populations in disordered solid states are quantitatively measured for the first time. A high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The conformational distribution and mutual interconversion of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters significantly affect the exciton utilization. However, their influence on the photophysics in amorphous film states is still not known due to the lack of a suitable quantitative analysis method. Herein, we used temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to quantitatively measure the relative populations of the conformations of a TADF emitter for the first time. We further propose a new concept of &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; for realizing high&#8208;efficiency nondoped OLEDs. Interestingly, this &#8220;compositionally&#8221; pure film actually behaves as a film with a dopant (quasi&#8208;equatorial form) in a matrix (quasi&#8208;axial form). The concentration&#8208;induced quenching that may occur at high concentrations is thus expected to be effectively relieved. The &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED prepared with the newly developed TADF emitter TP2P&#8208;PXZ as a neat emitting layer realizes a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% and neglectable efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>A Solid Transformation into Carboxyl Dimers Based on a Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Propyne/Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25942-25948, December 1, 2021. </description>

Reversible solid transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, microporous HOF&#8208;30a enables the selective adsorption of propyne over propylene according to single&#8208;component sorption and breakthrough experiments. The preferred propyne location in HOF has also been identified by SCXRD test.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine with the help of different solvents provides isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;30). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals HOF&#8208;30 possesses 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets connected by two kinds of hydrogen bonds, namely solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Degassing treatment for HOF&#8208;30 yields HOF&#8208;30a with 3D ten&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia nets but linked with sole carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers. Reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bond transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction.

Allendorf, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how the resulting AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipy material releases hydrogen at temperatures as low as 95&#8201;&#176;C with full decomposition at 250&#8201;&#176;C. The hydride can be regenerated at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, a pressure that is more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum.

A core&#8211;shell structure based on a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) and an upconversion nanoparticle is constructed by Tian&#8208;Fu Liu et&#8197;al. as described in their Communication on page&#8197;25701. The upconversion nanoparticle &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared irradiation into visible light, which excites the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition. The cover picture by Bai&#8208;Tong Liu illustrates the structure behaving like a Chinese lantern, in which the core&#8211;shell configuration delivers brightness and happiness.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Double Proton Transfer Across a Table: The Formic Acid Dimer&#8211;Fluorobenzene Complex (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25999-25999, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule, the protons of the formic acid dimer can still switch through quantum tunneling as they do in the pure formic acid dimer. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, Weixing Li, Denis&#8197;S. Tikhonov, and Melanie Schnell reveal the following mechanism in their Communication on page&#8197;25674: The neighboring fluorobenzene does not affect the reaction barrier but decreases the tunneling rate of the double&#8208;proton transfer of the formic acid dimer. The molecular view on the environment reorganization in this proton&#8208;transfer reaction is a step towards understanding these reactions in a complex environment.

Insulin secretion from &#946;&#8208;cells in intact islets can now be recorded together with calcium signal and organelles. In their Research Article on page&#8197;25846, Zhixing Chen and co&#8208;workers developed a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term, and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.

This Review outlines the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis. A wide range of C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming methods are highlighted, including polar, radical and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming processes. In this Review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;Metal Batteries under Practical Conditions</title>

Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted worldwide attention owing to the high energy density of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Nevertheless, the actual energy density of LMBs is often inferior to that of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This Review describes crucial parameters of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs, summarizes the recent advances in electrolyte systems for practical LMBs, and provides new perspectives for the design of novel electrolytes for LMBs.







Abstract
Given the limitations inherent in current intercalation&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries, much research attention has focused on potential successors to Li&#8208;ion batteries such as lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries. In order to realize the potential of these batteries, the use of metallic lithium as the anode is essential. However, there are severe safety hazards associated with the growth of Li dendrites, and the formation of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; during cycles leads to the inevitable loss of active Li, which in the end is undoubtedly detrimental to the actual energy density of Li&#8208;metal batteries. For Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, a low negative/positive ratio (N/P ratio), a electrolyte/cathode ratio (E/C ratio) along with a high&#8208;voltage cathode is prerequisite. In this Review, we summarize the development of new electrolyte systems for Li&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions, revisit the design criteria of advanced electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries and provide perspectives on future development of electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

Chemistry is central to addressing the challenges of human security in today's world, but surprisingly its role and contributions have not yet been explicitly defined. In this Essay, the repositioning of chemistry in this context is seen to present a powerful opportunity for its renewal as a science for the benefit of society. Chemists will need to play new roles and engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy.







Abstract
Human security, defined as &#8220;freedom from want and fear and freedom to live in dignity&#8221;, provides an overarching concept to address threats to human security dimensions such as health, food, economics, the environment and sustainable development, while placing the individual at the centre of attention. Chemistry is central to addressing these challenges, but surprisingly its role and contributions to human security have hitherto not been explicitly set out. This article situates chemistry in the human security framework, highlighting areas where chemistry knowledge, methods and products are vital. It underscores three complementary facets: 1)&#8197;chemistry contributes to many dimensions of human security, but needs to do much more in the light of oncoming global challenges; 2)&#8197;the human security framing illuminates areas where chemistry itself needs to adapt to contribute better, by intensification of current approaches and/or by building or strengthening chemistry tools, skills and competencies; and 3)&#8197;repositioning as central to human security affords chemistry a powerful opportunity to refresh itself as a science for the benefit of society&#8212;and it will need to engage more directly and dynamically at the interface of science, society and policy in order to do so.

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>

Branching orientation control of four&#8208;arm junction lattices can be achieved by branch point sequences or by enforcing struts.







Abstract
Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (e.g., i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.

         <title>Bis(perfluoropinacolato)silane: A Neutral Silane Lewis Superacid Activates Si&#8722;F Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25799-25803, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Si&#8208;based Lewis superacid was synthesized by using highly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoropinacolato substituents. The formed silane was obtained as the acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct and comprehensively characterized. The reaction with Et3SiF led to fluoride abstraction yielding the anionic fluorosilicate and the acetonitrile stabilized silylium ion. Catalysis screenings demonstrated high activity in Lewis acid catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Despite the earth abundance and easy availability of silicon, only few examples of isolable neutral silicon centered Lewis superacids are precedent in the literature. To approach the general drawbacks of limited solubility and unselective deactivation pathways, we introduce a Lewis superacid, based on perfluorinated pinacol substituents. The compound is easily synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale as the corresponding acetonitrile mono&#8208;adduct 1&#8901;(MeCN) and was fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SC&#8208;XRD) and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations. Lewis acidity investigations by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and fluoride abstraction experiments indicate a Lewis superacidic nature. The challenging Si&#8722;F bond activation of Et3SiF is realized and promising catalytic properties are demonstrated, consolidating the potential applicability of silicon centered Lewis acids in synthetic catalysis.

A surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped SnLi catalyst prepared by controlled electrochemical lithiation presented an outstanding partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of formate production, due to the local electron localization and lattice strain on the Sn surface. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed a high power density and an excellent stability of &gt;800 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 conversion to formate is a promising approach for reducing CO2 level and obtaining value&#8208;added chemicals, but its partial current density is still insufficient to meet the industrial demands. Herein, we developed a surface&#8208;lithium&#8208;doped tin (s&#8208;SnLi) catalyst by controlled electrochemical lithiation. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Li dopants introduced electron localization and lattice strains on the Sn surface, thus enhancing both activity and selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction to formate. The s&#8208;SnLi electrocatalyst exhibited one of the best CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate performances, with a partial current density of &#8722;1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for producing formate and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries equipped with the s&#8208;SnLi catalyst displayed one of the highest power densities of 1.24&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding stability of &gt;800 cycles. Our work suggests a promising approach to incorporate electron localization and lattice strain for the catalytic sites to achieve efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate electrosynthesis toward potential commercialization.

         <title>Biosynthetic Studies of Phomopsins Unveil Posttranslational Installation of Dehydroamino Acids by UstYa Family Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25729-25734, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the fungal ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide phomopsin was elucidated by gene inactivation experiments. Notably, chlorination by tyrosinase&#8208;like enzyme PhomQ1 and desaturation of amino acid moieties by UstYa family (DUF3328) proteins PhomYc/Yd/Ye were uncovered. Besides the known function of UstYa homologues, this study unveiled the remarkable functional diversity of these fungi&#8208;specific proteins.







Abstract
UstYa family proteins (DUF3328) are widely and specifically distributed in fungi. They are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and nonribosomal peptides, and possibly catalyze various reactions, including oxidative cyclization and chlorination. In this study, we focused on phomopsin&#8197;A, a fungal RiPP consisting of unique nonproteinogenic amino acids. Gene knockout experiments demonstrated that three UstYa homologues, phomYc, phomYd, and phomYe, are essential for the desaturation of amino acid moieties, showing unprecedented function among UstYa family proteins. Sequence similarity network analysis indicated that their amino acid sequences are highly diverged and that most remain uncharacterized, paving the way for genome mining of fungal metabolites with unique modifications.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25668-25673, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non&#8208;volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non&#8208;volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL&#8208;CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.







Abstract
Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL&#8208;CVD method is based on the formation of a non&#8208;volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL&#8208;CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL&#8208;CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.

In this study, core&#8211;shell heterostructures of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were fabricated via a stepwise ligand&#8208;grafting method. The UCNP &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation into visible ranges, which can further excite the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8211;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was fabricated for the first time via a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. The UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980&#8197;nm) into visible light (540&#8197;nm and 653&#8197;nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25746-25752, December 1, 2021. </description>

The coupling of a difluoroallylboronate with aryl and heteroaryl halides and triflates provides a convenient and broadly applicable synthesis of difluoroallylarenes. The difluoroallyl boron reagent is formed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of the inexpensive reagent 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene, and the products undergo a wide range of reactions to a series of difluoro&#8208;substituted analogs of common biologically valuable building blocks.







Abstract
We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.

         <title>General Synthesis of Multiple&#8208;Cores@Multiple&#8208;Shells Hollow Composites and Their Application to Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25719-25722, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable synthesis strategy is developed to fabricate multiple&#8208;cores@multiple&#8208;shells composite, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. The cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous with the number of cores and shells well controlled. Such a structure shows great promise for superior energy storage, multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential release, and tandem catalysis applications.







Abstract
Rational nanostructure design has proved fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of diverse fields. Especially hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) have stood out due to their temporal&#8211;spatial ordering mass transfer and buffering effect. Localizing multiple cores in a HoMS is highly desired, which could endow it with more fascinating properties. However, such a structure has been barely reported due to the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we develop a controllable synthesis strategy to realize such a structure, which is applicable for diverse cores and shells. Additionally, cores and shells could be tuned to be homogeneous or heterogeneous, with the core and shell number well controlled. In&#8197;situ TEM analysis verifies that the inner shell confines the expansion orientation of cores, while the outer shell maintains a stable interface. In addition to energy storage, such structure is also promising for multi&#8208;drug co&#8208;delivery and sequential responsive release as well as tandem catalysis applications.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25758-25761, December 1, 2021. </description>

Semiconducting MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, as well as precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on a nanowire array substrate. Compared to 2D thin films, the Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film shows one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD and fastest response speed among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH3 sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Trifluoromethylation Carbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes: Efficient Access to &#946;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Aliphatic Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>

A novel procedure on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. Catalyzed by a copper catalyst, carbonylative difunctionalization of alkenes with Togni&#8208;CF3 and nitrogen (or oxygen) nucleophiles occurred successfully. A variety of valuable &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl amides, esters and acids were obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Ethylene gas can also be successfully applied.







Abstract
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative trifluoromethylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed. A broad range of &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated carboxylic acid derivatives were prepared in moderate to excellent yields from simple alkenes with excellent regioselectivity. It is noteworthy that ethylene gas, as the simplest olefin, can also be applied directly to obtain &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amides and ester. This transformation presents the first example on carbonylative trifluoromethylation of alkenes.

         <title>Highly Perfluorinated Covalent Triazine Frameworks Derived from a Low&#8208;Temperature Ionothermal Approach Towards Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>

Highly perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks with nanoporous architecture are fabricated via a low temperature ionothermal pathway taking advantage of the superior catalytic activity of Lewis superacids and demonstrate good performance in electroreduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F&#8208;CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art F&#8208;CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl2&#8208;promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8722;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C). Fabricating F&#8208;CTFs with high fluorine contents (&gt;30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) remains challenging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;temperature ionothermal approach (275&#8201;&#176;C) to prepare F&#8208;CTFs, which is achieved via polymerization of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFPN) over the Lewis superacids, e.g., zinc triflimide [Zn(NTf2)2] without side reactions. With low catalyst loading (equimolar), F&#8208;CTFs are afforded with high fluorine content (31&#8197;wt&#8201;%), surface area up to 367&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and micropores around 1.1&#8197;nm. The highly hydrophobic F&#8208;CTF&#8208;1 exhibits good capability to boost electroreduction of CO2 to CO, with faradaic efficiency of 95.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high current density (&#8722;141&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) surpassing most of the metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;By using diazonaphthoquinones and anilines as key reagents and through a point-to-axis chiral transfer strategy, the atroposelective synthesis via asymmetric C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond insertion reaction of arenes has been realized under rhodium catalysis, providing the resulting biaryl atropisomers in moderate to excellent yields with good enantiomeric ratios (up to 99:1).

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Based Electron Donators to Stabilize and Activate Ultrafine Pt Nanoparticles for Efficient Hydrogen Atom Dissociation and Gas Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25766-25770, December 1, 2021. </description>

Co/NC heterojunctions are used as &#8220;solid ligands&#8221; to control the growth of as&#8208;supported ultrafine Pt nanoparticles via donating electrons. Ultrafine Pt nanoparticles with enhanced electron density promote the proton capture from electrolyte to catalyst surface, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and successive release of H2 molecules from the Pt surface.







Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is the most effective bench&#8208;marked catalyst for producing renewable and clean hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. There is demand for high HER catalytic activity to achieve efficient utilization and minimize the loading of Pt in catalysts. In this work, we significantly boost the HER mass activity of Pt nanoparticles in Ptx/Co to 8.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C by using Co/NC heterojunctions as a heterogeneous version of electron donors. The highly coupled interfaces between Co/NC and Pt metal enrich the electron density of Pt nanoparticles to facilitate the adsorption of H+, the dissociation of Pt&#8722;H bonds and H2 release, giving the lowest HER overpotential of 6.9&#8197;mV vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid among reported HER electrocatalysts. Given the easy scale&#8208;up synthesis due to the stabilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles by Co/NC solid ligands, Ptx/Co can even be a promising substitute for commercial Pt/C for practical applications.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Mediated N2&#8208;Splitting and Functionalization in the Presence of a Coordinated Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25804-25808, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molybdenum pincer for N2&#8208;splitting and functionalization is reported. The N2&#8208;cleavage affords a molybdenum nitrido complex and proceeds in the presence of a coordinated alkyne, that is, in the presence of a weaker C&#8801;C bond. The spatially and rationally restricted alkyne moiety is also tolerated during N&#8208;functionalization of the former nitrido complex.







Abstract
A new [PCCP]&#8208;coordinated molybdenum platform comprising a coordinated alkyne was employed for the cleavage of molecular dinitrogen. The coordinated &#951;2&#8208;alkyne was left unaffected during this reduction. DFT calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via an initially generated terminal N2&#8208;complex, which is converted to a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;(&#951;1:&#951;1)&#8208;N2&#8208;bridged intermediate prior to N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Protonation, alkylation and acylation of the resulting molybdenum nitrido complex led to the corresponding N&#8208;functionalized imido complexes. Upon oxidation of the N&#8208;acylated imido derivative in MeCN, a fumaronitrile fragment was built up via C&#8722;C coupling of MeCN to afford a dinuclear molybdenum complex. The key finding that the strong N&#8801;N bond may be cleaved in the presence of a weaker, but spatially constrained C&#8801;C bond contradicts the widespread paradigm that coordinated alkynes are in general more reactive than gaseous N2.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Evaluation of Treatment Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25762-25765, December 1, 2021. </description>

An integrated photocathodic nanotool was fabricated for dual&#8208;functional intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of cellular oxidative stress in single live cell.







Abstract
With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.

Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The experiment indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. The fluorobenzene environment slows down the proton transfer in this complex compared to the free formic acid dimer.







Abstract
Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrum indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. Each rotational transition of the parent isotopologue exhibits splitting. Isotopic substitution experiments show that the spectral splitting results from double&#8208;proton transfer tunneling in the formic acid dimer. Presence of fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic acid dimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3)&#8197;MHz to 267.608(1)&#8197;MHz. Calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzene does not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the course of the reaction, slowing down the proton transfer motion.

Quantum chemistry reveals a photoinduced cisoid to transoid rotation in the o&#8208;cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;, driven by the larger stability of the transoid rotamer in the excited triplet state. The non&#8208;radiative decay, supported by non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics and the absence of signal in fluorescence mapping experiments, allows the thermal recovery of the dominant cisoid arrangement in water solution.







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) anion ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;) is a well&#8208;known metallacarborane with multiple applications in a variety of fields. In aqueous solution, the cisoid rotamer is the most stable disposition in the ground state. The present work provides theoretical evidence on the possibility to photoinduce the rotation from the cisoid to the transoid rotamer, a conversion that can be reverted when the ground state is repopulated. The non&#8208;radiative decay mechanisms proposed in this work are coherent with the lack of fluorescence observed in 3D fluorescence mapping experiments performed on [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and its derivatives. This phenomenon induced by light has the potential to destruct the vesicles and micelles cisoid [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; typically forms in aqueous solution, which could lead to promising applications, particularly in the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>A Modular Cascade Synthetic Strategy Toward Structurally Constrained Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>

We developed a novel modular synthetic strategy for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade reaction. Notably, the obtained BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking.







Abstract
A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access structurally constrained boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4&#8208;boron migration and successive two&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs bearing B&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;a&#8208;1&#8201;i) or BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene (1&#8201;n&#8208;1&#8201;t) and double [4]helicene (1&#8201;u&#8208;1&#8201;v) are constructed by this cascade reaction. Remarkably, this synthetic strategy is characterized by modest yields (20&#8211;50&#8201;%) and broad substrate scope (18 examples) with versatile functional group tolerance. The resultant sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs show good stability under ambient conditions and are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Interestingly enough, BN&#8208;doped [4]helicene 1&#8201;o forms a unique alternating &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer of enantiomers within a helical columnar superstructure, while BN&#8208;doped double [4]helicene 1&#8201;u establishes an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;stacked trimeric sandwich structure with a rare 2D lamellar &#960;&#8208;stacking. The synthetic approach reported herein represents a powerful tool for the rapid generation of novel sc&#8208;B&#8208;PAHs, which are highly attractive for the elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship and for potential optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel synthetic strategy was developed for the construction of difficult-to-access structurally constrained boron-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (sc-B-PAHs) via a cascade reaction from the readily available ortho-aryl-substituted diarylalkynes. This domino process involves borylative cyclization, 1,4-boron migration and successive two-fold electrophilic borylation. Two types of sc-B-PAHs bearing B-doped [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;i&lt;/b&gt;) or BN-doped [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;n&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;t&lt;/b&gt;) and double [4]helicene (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;u&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;v&lt;/b&gt;) are constructed by this cascade reaction.

         <title>Exploiting Configurational Lability in Aza&#8208;Sulfur Compounds for the Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25680-25687, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual stereochemical feature of certain sulfonimidamides, in which tautomeric forms are also enantiomeric, has been exploited to develop a catalytic enantioselective synthesis of alkylated sulfonimidamides. The reactions proceed through a prochiral anionic intermediate to deliver enantiomerically enriched products. A double&#8208;alkylated, cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived catalyst is used as a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst.







Abstract
Methods for establishing the absolute configuration of sulfur&#8208;stereogenic aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives are scarce, often relying on cumbersome protocols and a limited pool of enantioenriched starting materials. We have addressed this by exploiting, for the first time, a feature of sulfonimidamides in which it is possible for tautomeric structures to also be enantiomeric. Such sulfonimidamides can readily generate prochiral ions, which we have exploited in an enantioselective alkylation process. Selectivity is achieved using a readily prepared bis&#8208;quaternized phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The overall process establishes the capability of configurationally labile aza&#8208;sulfur species to be used in asymmetric catalysis.

The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), 2,6&#8208;lutidine/ B(C6F5)3 mediates the catalytic reduction of CO2 using H2 and a silylhalide. Control of the silylhalide and solvent, affords selective avenues to the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. The mechanism is studied by DFT and accounts for the observed selectivity.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) derived from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and B(C6F5)3 is shown to mediate the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 using H2 as the reductant and a silylhalide as an oxophile. The nature of the products can be controlled with the judicious selection of the silylhalide and the solvent. In this fashion, this metal&#8208;free catalysis affords avenues to the selective formation of the disilylacetal (R3SiOCH2OSiR3), methoxysilane (R3SiOCH3), methyliodide (CH3I) and methane (CH4) under mild conditions. DFT studies illuminate the complexities of the mechanism and account for the observed selectivity.

         <title>Rationally Designed Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 Hollow Heterostructures from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25793-25798, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) are rationally designed and fabricated through a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;engaged synthetic approach. With the structural and compositional advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows efficient Zn&#8208;ion storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycle life.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn&#8208;based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two&#8208;step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn2O3&#8211;ZnMn2O4 hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn2+ insertion/extraction reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn-based oxides have sparked extensive scientific interest for aqueous Zn-ion batteries due to the rich abundance, plentiful oxidation states, and high output voltage. However, the further development of Mn-based oxides is severely hindered by the rapid capacity decay during cycling. Herein, a two-step metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-engaged templating strategy has been developed to rationally synthesize heterostructured Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hollow octahedrons (MO&#8211;ZMO HOs) for stable zinc ion storage. The distinctive composition and hollow heterostructure endow MO&#8211;ZMO HOs with abundant active sites, enhanced electric conductivity, and superior structural stability. By virtue of these advantages, the MO&#8211;ZMO HOs electrode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and outstanding electrochemical stability. Furthermore, ex situ characterizations reveal that the charge storage of MO&#8211;ZMO HOs mainly originates from the highly reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/extraction reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Functional Thermoplastic Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Properties by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Fluorostyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25735-25740, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new functionalized thermoplastic elastomer with excellent toughness and efficient elastic recovery has been successfully achieved through the direct copolymerization of E and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;fluorostyrene (oFS/mFS/pFS) using the scandium complex. The DFT simulation reveals that the bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8211;E segments.







Abstract
Herein, we report copolymerizations of ethylene (E) and ortho&#8208;/meta&#8208;/para&#8208;fluorostyrenes (SF=oFS/mFS/pFS) by using quinolyl methylene fluorenyl scandium complex (Flu&#8208;CH2&#8208;Qu)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2. The copolymerizations proceed in a controlled fashion to afford copolymers composed of &#8220;soft&#8221; ethylene&#8208;fluorostyurene (E&#8211;SF) random segments (Tg=&#8722;22.2&#8211;5.1&#8201;&#176;C) and &#8220;hard&#8221; crystalline ethylene&#8211;ethylene (E&#8211;E) segments (Tm=42.3&#8211;130.2&#8201;&#176;C). The copolymers behave like thermoplastic elastomers at room temperature by showing high stress values up to 39.5&#8197;MPa under elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break above 774&#8201;% with elastic recovery over 75&#8201;%. The excellent mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the microphase separation of the nanoscale crystalline E&#8211;E domain from the amorphous E&#8211;SF copolymer matrix proved by AFM, WAXD and SAXS. The mechanism investigation by the density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the steric bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8211;E segments, while the incorporation of SF is thermodynamic control.

         <title>Repurposing &#960; Electrophilic Cyclization/Dealkylation for Group Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 49, Page 25776-25780, December 1, 2021. </description>

Hijacking electrophilic cyclization intermediates allows for a pathway to acyclic tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Mechanistic studies indicate concerted thioboration of the alkyne precedes rate&#8208;determining ring opening and investigate the effects of ring&#8208;size and functional groups on reaction selectivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled group&#8208;transfer route toward the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes is described. In this route, an electrophilic heterocyclization is followed by ring&#8208;opening group transfer. Specifically, a thioboration reaction transforms readily available alkynyl sulfide precursors into alkenyl boronates and alkenyl sulfides with defined regio&#8208; and stereochemistry in one synthetic step using commercially available B&#8208;chlorocatecholborane (ClBcat). Mechanistic studies identified the likely pathway as proceeding through zwitterionic rather than haloborated intermediates. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry set in the initial cyclization step is preserved in the final acyclic alkene product, producing alkenes with up to four modifiable substituents with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Downstream functionalization reactions showcase the versatility of the substitutions of the resulting alkenes. The mechanistic concept maps onto future reaction designs, given the abundance of known electrophiles and nucleophiles for electrophilic heterocyclization/dealkylation sequences.

Au(SIPr)NTf2 has been identified for the room temperature ATA reaction to afford diverse 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline as amine and aldehyde and TFE or HFIP as the mediator. A formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine and synthetic transformations have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed room temperature allenation of terminal alkynes (ATA) with aldehydes affording 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allenes with diverse functional groups has been developed by identifying a gold(I) catalyst and an amine. The practicality of this reaction has been demonstrated by a ten gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the synthetic potentials have been demonstrated via various transformations and formal total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the gold catalyst, the aldehyde effect, the fluoroalkyl hydroxyl solvent (TFE or HFIP) and the structure of amine are vital in this room temperature ATA reaction.

         <title>Nickel(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring Expansion Toward Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzosiloles</title>

We disclosed a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles in excellent yields and enantioselectivities enabled by a Ni0/chiral PR3&#8208;catalyst system. Moreover, preliminary studies on the chiroptical properties of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems, which were synthesized by the presented catalysis strategy, are also described.







Abstract
The development of a straightforward strategy to obtain enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles remains a challenging yet appealing synthesis venture due to their potential future application in chiral electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this context, all of the existing methods rely on Rh&#8208;catalyzed systems and are somewhat limited in scope. Herein, we disclose the first Ni0&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion process that enables the preparation of benzosiloles possessing tetraorganosilicon stereocenters in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The presented catalysis strategy is further applied to the asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems. Preliminary studies reveal that such compounds exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atom Incorporated in Ruthenium Oxide Sphere: A Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for HER and OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active and stable bifunctional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial goal for clean and renewable energy, which still remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient and stable catalyst comprising Co single atom incorporated in RuO2 sphere for HER and OER, in which Co single atom in the RuO2 sphere were confirmed by XAS, AC&#8208;STEM, and DFT. This tailoring strategy uses Co single atom to modify the electronic structures of the surrounding Ru atoms and thereby remarkably elevates the electrocatalytic activities. The catalyst requires ultralow overpotentials, 45 mV for HER and 200 mV for OER, to deliver 10 mA/cm2 current density. The theoretical calculations reveal that the energy barriers for HER and OER are lowered after incorporation of cobalt single atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30 minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Chiral Polyrotaxane Monolayer with Emergent and Steerable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we propose a mechanically interlocked strategy to achieve 2D chiral polyrotaxane (2D  CPR  ) monolayer with emergent and steerable CPL activity by utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the chiral wheel and a luminescent dynamic covalent organic framework as 2D polymeric axle. Such methodology, integrating the host&#8208;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry, enabled the direct construction of delaminated 2D  CPR  monolayer with extraordinarily large size (up to tens of micrometers) and simultaneously endowed chirality to the extended 2D  CPR  network to generate CPL activity. Importantly, not only the structure but also the CPL performance of 2D  CPR  network can be further regulated by the feeding amount of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This work demonstrated a monolayered 2D  CPR  with CPL activity for the first time. The insightful structure&#8208;property relationship on the induced CPL will benefit to a deep understanding of the excited&#8208;state chirality of 2D chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Eutectic Crystallization Activates Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered a novel crystallized Zn2+ conductor based on inducing crystallization of high&#8208;entropy, charge&#8208;separated eutectic liquids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first introduction of the concept of a crystallized eutectic material to achieve dramatically enhanced multivalent&#8208;ion transport properties. This facile strategy may also open up opportunities for designing a wide variety of new solid ionic conductors.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state zinc (Zn) batteries offer a new candidate for emerging applications sensitive to volume, safety and cost. However, current solid polymeric or ceramic electrolyte structures remain poorly conductive for the divalent Zn2+, especially at room temperature. Constructing a heterogeneous interface which allows Zn2+ percolation is a viable option, but this is rarely involved in multivalent systems. Herein, we construct a solid Zn2+&#8208;ion conductor by inducing crystallization of tailored eutectic liquids formed by organic Zn salts and bipolar ligands. High&#8208;entropy eutectic&#8208;networks weaken the ion&#8208;association and form interfacial Zn2+&#8208;percolated channels on the nucleator surfaces, resulting in a solid crystal with exceptional selectivity for Zn2+ transport (t
=0.64) and appreciable Zn2+ conductivity (&#963;
=3.78&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, over 2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymers), and finally enabling practical ambient&#8208;temperature Zn/V2O5 metal solid cells. This design principle leveraged by the eutectic solidification affords new insights on the multivalent solid electrochemistry suffering from slow ion migration.

         <title>Macrocyclic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Composed of a Perylene Bisimide Dye Surrounded by Oligothiophene Bridges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of a perylene bisimide dye bridged by one or two quinquethiophene units are described. The compounds show panchromatic light absorption in the UV/Vis spectrum, multiple reversible redox processes, and a highly efficient charge separation by photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Two macrocyclic architectures comprising oligothiophene strands that connect the imide positions of a perylene bisimide (PBI) dye have been synthesized via a platinum&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling strategy. The crystal structure of the double bridged PBI reveals all syn&#8208;arranged thiophene units that completely enclose the planar PBI chromophore via a 12&#8208;membered macrocycle. The target structures were characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, as well as cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Both donor&#8211;acceptor dyads show ultrafast F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer and photoinduced electron transfer, thereby leading to extremely low fluorescence quantum yields even in the lowest polarity cyclohexane solvent.

         <title>Chemoselective and Diastereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Nucleoside Analogues by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Furanosyl Acetates with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanose acetates and aryl iodides is disclosed. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling showed good functional&#8208;group compatibility and excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity. The high chemoselectivity with respect to aryl iodides enabled the efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various post&#8208;functionalization reactions.







Abstract
Canonical nucleosides are vulnerable to enzymatic and chemical degradation, yet their stable mimics&#8212;C&#8208;aryl nucleosides&#8212;have demonstrated potential utility in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology, although current synthetic methods remain limited in terms of scope and selectivity. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling to prepare C&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues from readily available furanosyl acetates and aryl iodides. This nickel&#8208;catalyzed modular approach is characterized by mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent &#946;&#8208;selectivity, and high functional&#8208;group compatibility. The exclusive chemoselectivity with respect to the aryl iodide enables efficient preparation of a variety of C&#8208;aryl halide furanosides suitable for various downstream transformations. The practicality of this transformation is demonstrated through the synthesis of a potent analogue of a naturally occurring NF&#8208;&#954;B activator.

         <title>Five&#8208;Fold Symmetric Pentaindolo&#8208; and Pentakis(benzoindolo)Corannulenes: Unique Structural Dynamics Derived from the Combination of Helical and Bowl Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes with five azahelicene units were prepared and their structural dynamics were studied experimentally and theoretically. This motif contains many conformational isomers owing to the helical and bowl chiralities. The interconversion networks were explored by using GRRM17 program, which revealed that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties lower the activation energy barriers for some isomerization processes.







Abstract
Peripherally &#960;&#8208;extended corannulenes bearing quintuple azahelicene units, 10 and 11, were prepared and their dynamic behaviors were studied experimentally and theoretically. The fused corannulenes were synthesized from sym&#8208;pentabromocorannulene in three steps. X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis for 10 displayed a conformer possessing a P(M) bowl chirality and a PPMPM (PMPMM) helical chirality, which was found to be the most stable conformer(s). Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements of 10 and 11 revealed that their structural isomers can be interconvertible in solution, depending on the steric congestion around the helical scaffolds. Automated search for conformers in the equilibrium and transition states by Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) method revealed their interconversion networks, including bowl&#8208;inversion and helical&#8208;inversion. This analysis indicated that the co&#8208;existing corannulene and azahelicene moieties influence the conformational dynamics, which leads to mitigation of the activation energy barriers for isomerization.

         <title>Active Exsolved Metal&#8211;Oxide Interfaces in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Ceria Monoliths for Efficient and Durable CH4/CO2 Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we created active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles and show efficient and durable CH4/CO2 reforming at a relatively low temperature of 450&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 provides an attractive route to convert greenhouse gas into syngas; however, the resistance to sintering and coking of catalyst remains a fundamental challenge at high operation temperatures. Here we create active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) CeO2 monoliths with in situ exsolved single&#8208;crystalline (SC) Ni particles and show efficient dry reforming of CH4/CO2 at temperatures as low as 450&#8201;&#176;C. We show the excellent and durable performance with &#8776;20&#8201;% of CH4 conversion and &#8776;30&#8201;% of CO2 conversion even in a continuous operation of 240&#8197;hours. The well&#8208;defined active metal&#8211;oxide interfaces, created by exsolving SC Ni nanoparticles from PSC NixCe1&#8722;xO2 to anchor them on PSC CeO2 scaffolds, prevent nanoparticle sintering and enhance the coking resistance due to the stronger metal&#8211;support interactions. Our work would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the technique of creating active and durable metal&#8211;oxide interfaces in PSC monoliths could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.

         <title>Photoinitiated anti&#8208;Hydropentafluorosulfanylation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of new (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes was performed via the photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes. The reaction of SF5Cl with 24 substrates in the presence of (TMS)3SiH as a H&#8208;atom donor gave access to the undocumented Z&#8208;isomer. The origins of this unusual selectivity were investigated by DFT calculations, which provide a better understanding of the geometry and reactivity of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals.







Abstract
A photoinitiated anti&#8208;hydropentafluorosulfanylation of terminal alkynes using SF5Cl and (TMS)3SiH as the hydrogen atom donor is reported. This transformation generates selectively (Z)&#8208;(1&#8208;alken&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanes (Z:E : &gt;85:15), thus allowing the preparation of this previously unknown geometrical isomer. DFT calculations highlight that the selectivity is due to the intrinsic preference of SF5&#8208;substituted vinylic radicals to adopt a cis geometry, and to increased steric contacts during the transition structures leading to the minor (E)&#8208;products.

         <title>Density&#8208;Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation&#8208;Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color emission is achieved from a single fluorescent component by incorporating it into polyurethane matrices. Facilitated by the chemical structure of polyurethanes, the emission color could be modulated from blue to red by simply tuning the density of the chromophores, via either synthetic or physical approaches.







Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density&#8208;dependent emission colors from a single boron&#8208;containing chromophore, from which multi&#8208;color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originating from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. The chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full&#8208;color emitting materials; the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. The emission colors could also be modulated by physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non&#8208;emitting ones.

     alt="Density-Dependent Emission Colors from a Conformation-Switching Chromophore in Polyurethanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-color emission is achieved from a single fluorescent component by incorporating it into polyurethane matrices. Facilitated by the chemical structure of polyurethanes, the emission color could be modulated from blue to red by simply tuning the density of the chromophores, via either synthetic or physical approaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving full-color emission from a single chromophore is not only highly desirable from practical considerations, but also greatly challenging for fundamental research. Herein, we demonstrated the density-dependent emission colors from a single boron-containing chromophore, from which multi-color fluorescent polyurethanes were prepared as well. Originating from its switchable molecular conformations, the emission color of the chromophore was found to be governed by the packing density and strongly influenced by hydrogen bonding interactions. The chromophore was incorporated into polyurethanes to achieve full-color emitting materials; the emission color was only dependent on the chromophore density and could be tuned via synthetic approach by controlling the compositions. The emission colors could also be modulated by physical approaches, including by swelling/deswelling process, compression under high pressure, and even blending the fluorescent polyurethane with non-emitting ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Crosslinked Polymer Networks for Highly Effective Iodine Adsorption from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks was synthesized via Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara polycondensation. One system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective for iodine capture from water with an uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and quick kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8197;min&#8722;1). Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP was able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous phase with a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.







Abstract
A series of calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based crosslinked polymer networks designed for iodine capture is reported. These materials were prepared by Sonogashira coupling of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;alkynylphenyl)calix[4]pyrrole with bishalide building blocks with different electronic properties and molecular sizes. Despite their low Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas, iodine vapor adsorption capacities of up to 3.38&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 were seen, a finding ascribed to the presence of a large number of effective sorption sites including macrocyclic &#960;&#8208;rich cavities, aryl units, and alkyne groups within the material. One particular system, C[4]P&#8208;BTP, was found to be highly effective at iodine capture from water (uptake capacity of 3.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from a concentrated aqueous KI/I2 solution at ambient temperature). Fast capture kinetics (kobs=7.814&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1) were seen. Flow&#8208;through adsorption experiments revealed that C[4]P&#8208;BTP is able to remove 93.2&#8201;% of iodine from an aqueous source phase at a flow rate of 1&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1.

         <title>Quantifying Intracellular Single Vesicular Catecholamine Concentration with Open Carbon Nanopipettes to Unveil the Effect of L&#8208;DOPA on Vesicular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were calculated based on the narrowed distributions of vesicular content and size obtained with 100&#8197;nm open CNPs. We have shown that vesicular dense core size and content increase while catecholamine concentrations are essentially unchanged after exposure to L&#8208;DOPA.







Abstract
Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis is essential for uncovering the pathologies of neuronal disorders and developing related pharmaceuticals. In this work intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) measurements with different&#8208;sized (50&#8211;500&#8197;nm radius) open carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) were performed to quantify the vesicular content and release kinetics of specific vesicle populations grouped by orifice sizes. Intracellular vesicles with radius below 100&#8197;nm were captured and narrowed between 50 and 100&#8197;nm. On the basis of this, single vesicular catecholamine concentrations in the intracellular environment were quantified as 0.23&#8211;1.1&#8197;M. Our results with L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;exposure indicate that L&#8208;DOPA regulates exocytosis by increasing the dense core size and vesicular content while catecholamine concentrations did not show obvious alterations. These were all achieved simultaneously and relatively noninvasively with open CNPs.

         <title>Divergent and Modular Synthesis of Terpenoid Scaffolds via a AuI Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot sequence involving an exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a Lewis acid gold(I) catalyzed cyclization has allowed access to three complex polycyclic scaffolds. Structural diversity is obtained by varying solvent and the ligand of the gold(I) catalyst. An additional Diels&#8211;Alder step generates tetracyclic cores possessing up to 5 stereocenters.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot cascade sequence to generate synthetically challenging polycyclic scaffolds is reported utilizing a novel Lewis acid gold catalyst for the key cyclization step, enabling the divergent synthesis of both 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic and 6,6,6,5&#8208;tetracyclic cores through both ligand and reaction condition control. We have combined the intrinsic complexity and stereoselectivity of cycloadditions with the electronic and steric properties of gold complexes to selectively generate complex polycyclic scaffolds in a single operation.

         <title>Enhancing Dye&#8208;Triplet&#8208;Sensitized Upconversion Emission Through the Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in CsLu2F7:Yb/Er Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of upconversion (UC) nanocrystals of CsLu2F7:Yb/Er are developed to achieve efficient UC through triplet sensitization of NIR dye IR808, resulting in a 1309&#8208;fold enhancement in UC luminescence intensity and a more than 180&#8208;fold improvement of the absolute UC quantum yield over bare counterparts. Sensitive detection of intracellular ClO&#8722; is demonstrated by virtue of the 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric UC luminescence.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped upconversion (UC) nanoprobes, which have drawn extensive attention for various bioapplications, usually suffer from small absorption cross&#8208;sections and weak luminescence intensity of Ln3+ ions. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of a new class of Ln3+&#8208;doped UC nanoprobes based on CsLu2F7:Yb/Er nanocrystals (NCs), which can effectively increase the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency from singlet excited state to triplet excited state of IR808 up to 99.3&#8201;% through the heavy atom effect. By virtue of the efficient triplet sensitization of IR808, the optimal UC luminescence (UCL) intensity of IR808&#8208;modified CsLu2F7:Yb/Er NCs is enhanced by 1309 times upon excitation at 808&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the intense dye&#8208;triplet&#8208;sensitized UCL, the nanoprobes are demonstrated for sensitive assay of extracellular and intracellular hypochlorite with an 808&#8208;nm/980&#8208;nm dual excited ratiometric strategy.

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C6&#8208;Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA, and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Further analysis based on site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and computational calculations provided the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Furthermore, an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase was created by introducing a W210A substitution.







Abstract
Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg2+ and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 and 2.56&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C6&#8208;methyltransferase.

         <title>Unlocking the Stereoselectivity and Substrate Acceptance of Enzymes: Proline&#8208;Induced Loop Engineering Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of interfaced proline residues as the &#8220;key&#8221; to unlock enzyme evolvability and thus access biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.







Abstract
Protein stability and evolvability influence each other. Although protein dynamics play essential roles in various catalytically important properties, their high flexibility and diversity makes it difficult to incorporate such properties into rational engineering. Therefore, how to unlock the potential evolvability in a user&#8208;friendly rational design process remains a challenge. In this endeavor, we describe a method for engineering an enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase. It enables synthetically important substrate acceptance for 4&#8208;chlorophenyl pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl ketone, and perfect stereocontrol of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configured products. Thermodynamic analysis unveiled the subtle interaction between enzyme stability and evolvability, while computational studies provided insights into the origin of selectivity and substrate recognition. Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of the (S)&#8208;product (73&#8201;% yield; &gt;99&#8201;% ee) was performed on a gram&#8208;scale. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates that interfaced proline residues can be rationally engineered to unlock evolvability and thus provide access to new biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.

         <title>Configurational Lability at Tetrahedral Phosphorus: syn/anti&#8208;Isomerization of a P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphiranium Cation by Intramolecular Epimerization at Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral carbon and analogous four&#8208;coordinate main&#8208;group compounds are configurationally stable, but we report intramolecular P&#8208;epimerization of chiral phosphiranium cations under mild conditions. How? In the proposed mechanism, P&#8208;C cleavage yields an intermediate pendant &#946;&#8208;carbocation which promotes low&#8208;barrier pyramidal inversion at phosphorus, while hyperconjugative stabilization from a P&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;bond preserves the cation's C&#8208;chirality.







Abstract
Tetrahedral main&#8208;group compounds are normally configurationally stable, but P&#8208;epimerization of the chiral phosphiranium cations syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][OTf] (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)3C6H2) occurred under mild conditions at 60&#8201;&#176;C in CD2Cl2, resulting in isomerization to give a syn&#8208;enriched equilibrium mixture. Ion exchange with excess [NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT] (&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT=&#916;&#8208;P(o&#8208;C6Cl4O2)3) followed by chromatography on silica removed [NBu4][OTf] and gave mixtures of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[Mes*P(Me)CH2CHPh][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]&#8901;x[NBu4][&#916;&#8208;TRISPHAT]. NMR spectroscopy showed that isomerization proceeded with epimerization at P and retention at C. DFT calculations are consistent with a mechanism involving P&#8208;C cleavage to yield a hyperconjugation&#8208;stabilized carbocation, pyramidal inversion promoted by &#963;&#8208;interaction of the P lone pair with the neighboring &#946;&#8208;carbocation, and ring closure with inversion of configuration at P.

         <dc:description>
A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate and broad reaction scope, highlighting the diverse applicability and the potential utility of this protocol in late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
A mild visible light&#8208;induced palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reaction of diazo compounds and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones is reported. A broad range of vinyl arenes and heteroarenes with high functional group tolerance, as well as a range of different diazo compounds, can efficiently undergo this transformation. This method features Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;assisted generation of hybrid palladium C(sp3)&#8208;centered radical intermediate, which allowed for new selective C&#8722;H functionalization protocol.

         <title>Selective Approaches to &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Arylated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzyl vinyl ethers have selectively been arylated at either &#945; or &#946; position by fine&#8208;tuned Heck&#8208;type palladium catalyses. In contrast to previous protocols, no excess of arylating reagent or substrate chelation is necessary. For achieving good yields and high &#945;/&#946;&#8208;selectivities various factors determining the catalytic system had to be optimized. The results of DFT computational studies correlate selectivity with electron richness on the Pd center.







Abstract
We developed simple and efficient protocols for palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;arylations of structurally diverse vinyl ethers. Both catalytic methods proceed under relatively mild reactions conditions applying to a broad substrate range including more complex compounds providing arylated glucal or isochromene. Lacking the common requirement of a large reagent excess, the transformations are highly economic and limiting the waste production. Results from computational studies (DFT) provided insight into the key factors determining the pronounced regioselectivities of the investigated reactions.

         <title>Solar Urea: Towards a Sustainable Fertilizer Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct urea synthesis from NH3 and CO2 was achieved over Pd/LTA&#8208;3A powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for reaction with CO2, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O, shifting the equilibrium towards urea production.







Abstract
Urea, an agricultural fertilizer, nourishes humanity. The century&#8208;old Bosch&#8211;Meiser process provides the world's urea. It is multi&#8208;step, consumes enormous amounts of non&#8208;renewable energy, and has a large CO2 footprint. Thus, developing an eco&#8208;friendly synthesis for urea is a priority. Herein we report a single&#8208;step Pd/LTA&#8208;3A catalyzed synthesis of urea from CO2 and NH3 under ambient conditions powered solely by solar energy. Pd nanoparticles serve the dual function of catalyzing the dissociation of NH3 and providing the photothermal driving force for urea formation, while the absorption capacity of LTA&#8208;3A removes by&#8208;product H2O to shift the equilibrium towards urea production. The solar urea conversion rate from NH3 and CO2 is 87&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This advance represents a first step towards the use of solar energy in urea production. It provides insights into green fertilizer production, and inspires the vision of sustainable, modular plants for distributed production of urea on farms.

         <title>Athermal, Chemically Triggered Release of RNA from Thioester Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioester linked oligo(T) nucleic acids are utilized for an efficient enrichment of mRNA from total RNA under ambient temperature. The selective binding of uncharged oT TENA to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA and release via a self&#8208;immolative degradation of thioester backbone under ambient temperature were the key features that enabled this approach.







Abstract
An athermal approach to mRNA enrichment from total RNA using a self&#8208;immolative thioester linked nucleic acids (TENA) is described. Oligo(thymine) (oT) TENA has a six&#8208;atom spacing between bases which allowed TENA to selectively base&#8208;pair with polyadenine RNA. As a result of the neutral backbone of TENA and the hydrophobicity of the octanethiol end group, oT TENA is water insoluble and efficiently pulled down 93&#177;2&#8201;% of EGFP mRNA at a concentration of 10&#8197;ng&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. Self&#8208;immolative degradation of TENA upon ambient temperature exposure to nucleophilic buffer components (Tris, DTT) allowed recovery of 55&#177;27&#8197;ng of mRNA from 3.1 &#956;g of total RNA, which was not statistically different from the amount recovered using Dynabeads&#174; mRNA DIRECT Kit (89&#177;24&#8197;ng). Gene expression as measured by RT&#8208;qPCR was comparable for both enrichment methods, suggesting that the mild conditions required for enrichment of mRNA using oT TENA are compatible with RT&#8208;qPCR and other downstream molecular biology applications.

         <title>Connecting Rheological Properties and Molecular Dynamics of Egg&#8208;Tempera Paints based on Egg Yolk</title>

Crack the code of egg&#8208;tempera paints: The macroscopic and microscopic properties of egg&#8208;tempera paint prepared with green earth are highlighted via rheology and NMR relaxometry.







Abstract
Egg&#8208;tempera painting is a pictorial technique widely used in the Middle Ages, although poorly studied in its physico&#8208;chemical aspects until now. Here we show how NMR relaxometry and rheology can be combined to probe egg&#8208;tempera paints and shed new light on their structure and behavior. Based on recipes of the 15th century, model formulations with egg yolk and green earth have been reproduced to characterize the physicochemical properties of this paint at the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. The rheological measurements highlight a synergetic effect between green earth and egg yolk, induced by the interactions between them and the structural organisation of the system. 1H&#8197;NMR relaxometry emphasizes the presence and the structure of a network formed by the yolk and the pigment.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01 M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of ~100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for  Staphylococcus aureus  (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by  in vitro  selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.</dc:description>

The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA-modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>M&#246;bius Zn(II)&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic Zn(II) complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite  inwards  /  outwards  orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite  P  and  M  M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95 %). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fe  3+  complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein,  upon Aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable PdI Dimer Enabled Remote Functionalization: Access to Fluorinated 1,1&#8208;Diaryl Alkanes with Unprecedented Speed</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2.







Abstract
While remote functionalization via chain walking has the potential to enable access to molecules via novel disconnections, such processes require relatively long reaction times and can be in need of elevated temperatures. This work features a remote arylation in less than 10&#8197;min reaction time at room temperature over a distance of up to 11 carbons. The unprecedented speed is enabled by the air&#8208;stable PdI dimer [Pd(&#956;&#8208;I)(PCy2tBu)]2, which in contrast to its PtBu3 counterpart does not trigger direct coupling at the initiation site, but regioconvergent and chemoselective remote functionalization to yield valuable fluorinated 1,1&#8208;diaryl alkanes. Our combined experimental and computational studies rationalize the origins of switchability, which are primarily due to differences in dispersion interactions.

         <title>Photocleavable Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes: Fast Release with Spatiotemporal Control in Inner Leaflets of Plasma Membrane, Nuclear Envelope, and Secretory Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open, dynamic, and elusive membrane motifs are labeled without chemical or physical interference to image their order and tension in living cells: Fast release with light from specific targets liberates the original small&#8208;molecule flipper probe in the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope, the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, or along the secretory pathway to address current questions of biological significance.







Abstract
Mechanosensitive flipper probes are attracting interest as fluorescent reporters of membrane order and tension in biological systems. We introduce PhotoFlippers, which contain a photocleavable linker and an ultralong tether between mechanophore and various targeting motifs. Upon irradiation, the original probe is released and labels the most ordered membrane that is accessible by intermembrane transfer. Spatiotemporal control from photocleavable flippers is essential to access open, dynamic or elusive membrane motifs without chemical or physical interference. For instance, fast release with light is shown to place the original small&#8208;molecule probes into the innermost leaflet of the nuclear envelope to image changes in membrane tension, at specific points in time of membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway, or in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to explore membrane asymmetry. These results identify PhotoFlippers as useful chemistry tools to enable research in biology.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.







Abstract
Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.

While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two-dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Druggable Allosteric Sites in &#946;&#8208;Propeller Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug&#8208;like inhibitors for bacterial carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins called lectins are challenging. Computational and experimental analyses (NMR and SPR) of related &#946;&#8208;propeller lectins from Burkholderia ambifaria (BambL), Ralstonia solanacearum (RSL), and Aspergillus fumigatus (AFL) identified druggable secondary pockets, which will support the design of allosteric inhibitors as new therapeutics against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins (lectins) are auspicious targets in drug discovery to combat antimicrobial resistance; however, their non&#8208;carbohydrate drug&#8208;like inhibitors are still unavailable. Here, we present a druggable pocket in a &#946;&#8208;propeller lectin BambL from Burkholderia ambifaria as a potential target for allosteric inhibitors. This site was identified employing 19F&#8197;NMR fragment screening and a computational pocket prediction algorithm SiteMap. The structure&#8211;activity relationship study revealed the most promising fragment with a dissociation constant of 0.3&#177;0.1&#8197;mM and a ligand efficiency of 0.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;HA&#8722;1 that affected the orthosteric site. This effect was substantiated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in the orthosteric and secondary pockets. Future drug&#8208;discovery campaigns that aim to develop small molecule inhibitors can benefit from allosteric sites in lectins as a new therapeutic approach against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Mo3S132&#8722; Intercalated Layered Double Hydroxide: Highly Selective Removal of Heavy Metals and Simultaneous Reduction of Ag+ Ions to Metallic Ag0 Ribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of Mo3S132&#8722; into MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) gives a new material. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH, which exhibits enormous adsorption capacities of noble metal silver (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and toxic Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) as well as high uptake selectivity for Ag+ and Cu2+. Both S22&#8722; and Mo4+ in Mo3S13&#8208;LDH contribute to the reduction of Ag+ to metallic Ag0.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new material by intercalating Mo3S132&#8722; into Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (abbr. Mo3S13&#8208;LDH), exhibiting excellent capture capability for toxic Hg2+ and noble metal silver (Ag). The as&#8208;prepared Mo3S13&#8208;LDH displays ultra&#8208;high selectivity of Ag+, Hg2+ and Cu2+ in the presence of various competitive ions, with the order of Ag+&gt;Hg2+&gt;Cu2+&gt;Pb2+&#8805;Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+. For Ag+ and Hg2+, extremely fast adsorption rates (&#8776;90&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min, &gt;99&#8201;% in 1&#8197;h) are observed. Much high selectivity is present for Ag+ and Cu2+, especially for trace amounts of Ag+ (&#8776;1&#8197;ppm), achieving a large separation factor (SFAg/Cu) of &#8776;8000 at the large Cu/Ag ratio of 520. The overwhelming adsorption capacities for Ag+ (qmAg=1073&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Hg2+ (qmHg=594&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) place the Mo3S13&#8208;LDH at the top of performing sorbent materials. Most importantly, Mo3S13&#8208;LDH captures Ag+ via two paths: a) formation of Ag2S due to Ag&#8208;S complexation and precipitation, and b) reduction of Ag+ to metallic silver (Ag0). The Mo3S13&#8208;LDH is a promising material to extract low&#8208;grade silver from copper&#8208;rich minerals and trap highly toxic Hg2+ from polluted water.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon&#8208;Based Nanoparticle&#8208;supported Dispersed Cu2+ Disrupts Redox Homeostasis to Enhance CDT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In chemodynamic therapy (CDT), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. However, the high levels of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells consume the ROS, directly reducing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which consume GSH  via  redox reactions to produce Cu+  that catalyze H2O2  to produce &#183;OH, thus the ROS level was observably increased through this synergistic effect.  In vivo  experiments further revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can affect the activity of some protein sulfhydryl groups in cells, which was assessed by rdTOP&#8208;ABPP assay. In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multi&#8209;wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective peak wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus, promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed methodology provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D&#160;nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination at Tin(I) via Hemi&#8208;Lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of a distannyne supported by a pincer ligand bearing pendant amine donors that is capable of reversibly activating E&#8211;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8211;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}  n  SnAr (  n  = 1, 2). The experimentally observed (decreasing) propensity towards chain growth with increasing chain length can be rationalized both thermodynamically and kinetically by the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the &#8211;Sn(Ar)H&#8211; backbone units generated via oxidative addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8208;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but often limited in irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO  2  &#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact property and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328 cm/s. We envision that this finding offers inspirations to design smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials for impact protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1) in&#8208;situ controllable H2S release, (2) concomitant fluorescence response, and (3) mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Raman probing of hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces with atomic layer accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic metals under photoexcitation can generate energetic hot electrons to directly induce chemical reactions. However, the capability and fundamental insights of the transportation of these hot electrons at plasmonic metal&#8208;2D material interfaces remain unclear. Herein, hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces has been in situ studied using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with atomic layer accuracy. Combining in situ SERS studies with density functional theory calculations, it is proved that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and directly penetrate graphene to trigger photocatalytic reactions. With increasing graphene layers, the transportation of hot electrons decays rapidly and would be completely blocked after five layers of graphene. Moreover, the transfer of hot electrons can be modulated by applying an external electric field, and the hot&#8208;electron transfer efficiency under electrochemical conditions is improved by over three times in the presence of a monolayer of graphene. These fundamental understandings about hot&#8208;electron transfer provide insightful information to promote the design of more efficient plasmonic materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attentions and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single-atom catalysts have received widespread attentions and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non-metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) via high-temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C-Se-C bond. Impressively, the obtained single-atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpass state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal-free single atom-based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenanthrocarbazole&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymer with Noncovalently Conformational Locking for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs). Constraining configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility.  Herein, a noncovalently conformational locking via S&#8208;&#8208;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (  PC  ) based polymeric HTM,  PC6  , to fix molecular geometries and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic study from structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of  PC  remarkably enhances &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at perovskite/HTM interface and further depressing interfacial recombination. Consequently, PSC employing  PC6  as dopant&#8208;free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparing two&#8208;dimensional ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 crystal in interlayer channel of thin laminar inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte towards ultrafast Li+ transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13 &#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with ~ 1.3 nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li  0.33  La  0.557  TiO  3  (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in&#8208;situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li  +  transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15 &#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10  &#8722;5  S cm  &#8722;1  and conductance of 87.2 mS at 30  o  C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24 GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO  4  battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizer for In Vivo Image&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a Pt(II) metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8211;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Benefit from this design, such supramolecular photosensitizer, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, demonstrated improved fluorescence performance and efficient photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteria. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of  S. aureus  &#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of  S. aureus  without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduciton. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Tph&#8208;COF&#8208;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (~1.0 &#956;m) and ultrathin (~3.8 nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (~80%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8208;220.0 mA cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.9 V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Protein Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Ordered&#8208;Disordered Protein Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8208;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least&#8208;squares global Boltzmann&#8208;fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)  20  , (VPGVG)  40  and (VPGVG)  60  , we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;&#8208;turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of ~20 repeat units). The differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;&#8208;turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein&#8208;based smart materials.</dc:description>

Employing matrix least-squares global Boltzmann-fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)  20  , (VPGVG)  40  and (VPGVG)  60  , we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;-turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of ~20 repeat units). The differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;-turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein-based smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate a variety of porous colloidal superstructure from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>19F NMR Allows to Investigate the Fate of Platinum(IV) Prodrugs in Physiological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt(IV) prodrugs can overcome resistance and side effects of conventional Pt(II) anticancer therapies. By  19  F&#8208;labeling of a Pt(IV) prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA =  p  &#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation under physiological conditions could be investigated. It is found that, unlike single&#8208;electron reductants, multi&#8208;electron agents can efficiently promote the two electrons reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). Moreover, the activation of Pt&#8208;FBA in cell lysate is highly dependent upon the type of cancer cells. When administered to  E. coli  , Pt&#8208;FBA is reduced intracellularly and free FBA can shuttle out of the cell. Interestingly, the reduction rate greatly increases by inducing metallothionein overexpression and is lowered by addition of Zn(II) ions. Finally, when injected into mice, Pt&#8208;FBA undergoes fast reduction in the bloodstream accompanied by metabolic degradation of FBA; nevertheless, unreduced Pt&#8208;FBA can accumulate to detectable levels in liver and kidneys. The proposed  19  F&#8208;NMR approach has the advantage of avoiding the interference of all background signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low&#160;Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capture of low concentration CO  2  presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing  ca.  400 ppm CO  2  . Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn  2+  loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb  ca.  0.51 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to  ca.  0.67 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO  2  adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites are worthy of further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+  (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8208;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13  battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65 mA cm&#8208;2  and 1.07 mAh cm&#8208;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to subnanoscale exhibit great potentials in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along [022] direction is synthesized on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane to achieve ultrahigh Li  +  permeance of 27.01 mol&#183;m  &#8722;2  &#183;h  &#8722;1  as well as very decent Li  +  /Mg  2+  selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of transport energy barrier between Li  +  and Mg  2+  , which is caused by different extent of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50% (P&#8208;50), and 75% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37 eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12 S/cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Li&#8208;CO2 Battery Enabled by Carbon Nanotube/Carbon Nitride Heterostructured Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO2  batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2  reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8208;CO2  battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride&#160;and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8208;CO2  battery. The resulting battery delivers high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04 V) and superior cycling stability (86.1% efficiency retention after 100 cycles).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy&#8208;efficient selective physisorption driven C2H2 separation from industrial C2&#8208;C1 impurities such as C2H4, CO2 and CH4 marks high importance in the purification of downstream commodity chemicals. We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, namely iMOF&#8208;nC (n = 5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C2H2 uptakes versus the competing C2&#8208;C1 gases (C2H4, CO2 and CH4). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best&#8208;performing iMOF&#8208;6C revealed the first three&#8208;in&#8208;one C2H2 adsorption selectivity guided separation of C2H2 from 1:1 C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CH4 mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C2H2 selective interactions in iMOF&#8208;nC. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C2H2&#8208;selective layered metal&#8208;organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Neutral Homocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation of the neutral homocyclic silylene 2 is possible via amine ligand abstraction with potassium graphite (KC8) and subsequent reaction with SiMe3Cl from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via an anionic homoaromatic silicon ring compound 1 as an intermediate. The twofold&#8208;coordinated silicon atom in the homocyclic silylene 2 is stabilized by an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. 2 reacts in an oxidative addition with 2 equivalents of MeOH and in cycloadditions with ethene, phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene and with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to afford novel functionalized ring compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Bonded Cubic AsN from High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Chemical Reactivity of Arsenic and Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reactivity between As and N2  , leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a Diamond Anvil Cell. Single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40 GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic  P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50 GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343 K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO &#8644; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298 K to 343 K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox. = H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P + Ox. &#8594; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;).</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined due to the lack of the reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin B. Here we provided the X&#8208;ray structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8226;2OG&#8226;fumitremorgin B at resolution of 1.22 &#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin B has induced the significant compression of the active pocket and Y68 in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support the CarC&#8208;like mechanism proposed by Bollinger and coworkers, in which Y68 rather than Y224 acts as the H atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our work is consistent with all available experimental data and highlights the importance of the accurate complex structure in mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm&#8208;levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limits of detection (LOD) of 0.53 ppm toward CO at low driving voltages of 0.1 V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50 ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, for multiple exposures and realize CO detection in air and humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes for CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Afterglow/MRI Bimodal Nanoprobe with Fast Response to H2S for In Vivo Imaging of Acute Hepatitis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate detection of hepatic hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) to monitor H  2  S&#8208;related enzymes&#8217; activity is critical for acute hepatitis diagnosis, but remains a challenge due to the dynamic and transient nature of H  2  S. Here, we report a H  2  S&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared afterglow/MRI bimodal probe  F1  &#8208;GdNP, which shows an &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; MRI signal and &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow signal toward H  2  S.  F1  &#8208;GdNP shows fast response, high sensitivity and specificity toward H  2  S, permitting afterglow imaging of H  2  S and evaluation of cystathionine  &#947;  &#8208;lyase&#8217;s activity in living mice. We further employ the high spatial&#8208;resolution MRI signal of  F1  &#8208;GdNP to track its delivery and accumulation in liver. Importantly,  F1  &#8208;GdNP offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR = 86.2 &#177; 12.0) to sensitively report on the increased hepatic H  2  S level in the acute hepatitis mice via afterglow imaging, which correlated well with the upregulated CSE activity in the liver, showcasing the good potential of  F1  &#8208;GdNP for monitoring of acute hepatitis process in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface &#8211; Molecular Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy stor&#8208;age and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. We reveal that the charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8208;Chapman&#8208;Stern&#8208;model. Performing Molecular Dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions as innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial infections has become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Developing long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial materials becomes an urgent need. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high  in vitro  antimicrobial efficiency ( &gt; 99 %) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Triplet Generation Promoted via Spiro&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro&#8208;linked bichromophoric molecular systems are superior for triplet excited state generation. First, the two chromophores are tethered into a close proximity not accessible via alternative linkage, promoting spiro&#8208;conjugation mediated charge&#8208;transfer (CT). Second, the spiro&#8208;orthogonality inhibit FRET&#8208;type non&#8208;radiative deactivation and high rigidity largely suppresses vibronic energy dissipation. An intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant of 1.0&#215;10  11  s  &#8208;1  was previously registered with a spiro&#8208;bis&#8208;benzophenone scaffold. We envisage that triplet generation efficiency could be further enhanced by stabilizing the spiro&#8208;CT state and rationally designed a family of spiro&#8208;compounds (SCTs), which consist of electron&#8208;rich diphenyl ether as the spiro&#8208;CT donor and electron&#8208;deficient dinaphthyl ketone as the spiro&#8208;CT acceptor. Through fine&#8208;tuning of the energy level between the CT and high energy triplet states, near&#8208;unity triplet generation quantum yield was achieved and the underlying ISC mechanism is revealed by using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Finally, potential triplet sensitizing application was demonstrated in SCTs. Our findings suggest that spiro&#8208;bichromophoric molecular system with an enhanced spiro&#8208;charge transfer warrants efficient triplet generation and represents a powerful design strategy of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet sensitizers with predictable ISC property.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.</dc:description>
