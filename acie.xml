         <title>Metal&#8208;Free C&#8208;H Functionalization via Diaryliodonium Salts with a Chemically Robust Dummy Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step strategy for the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8211;H functionalization of arenes using unsymmetrical iodonium salts as versatile synthetic linchpins is presented. The key to the success of this strategy is the identification of the 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;isoxazolyl (DMIX) group as a superior dummy ligand, which enables not only site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization to afford unsymmetrical iodonium salts, but also highly selective aryl transfer during the subsequent metal&#8208;free coupling reaction. Both electron&#8208;rich and moderately electron deficient arenes can be converted into the iodonium salts through C&#8211;H functionalization, allowing for diverse structural elaboration by metal&#8208;free C&#8211;N, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;O coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven Highly Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Towards Tunable Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the easy over&#8208;oxidation, it is a promising yet challenging task for exploring renewable carbon resources to control the sunlight&#8208;driven selective catalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), producing important chemical feedstocks &#8722; less&#8208;oxidized 2, 5&#8208;diformylfurane (DFF) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). Herein, we have developed a photocatalyst by anchoring Ru complex on CdS quantum dots, which achieves selective oxidation of HMF toward DFF or HMFCA with high conversion (&gt;81%) and selectivity (&gt;90%), based on controllable generation of two oxygen radicals under different atmospheres. Such selective conversion can also work well outside the laboratory by natural sunlight. In particular, the selective production of HMFCA through photocatalytic HMF oxidation is achieved for the first time. More importantly, our photocatalyst is proven applicable for the selective oxidation of other compounds with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Adatom Bonding Sites in a Nickel&#8208;Fe3O4(001) Single&#8208;Atom Model Catalyst and O2 Reactivity Unveiled by Surface Action Spectroscopy with Infrared Free&#8208;electron Laser Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis presently receives much attention with its promise to decrease the cost of the active material while increasing the catalyst&#8217;s performance. However, key details such as the exact location of SA species and their stability are often unclear due to a lack of atomic level information. Here, we show how vibrational spectra measured with surface action spectroscopy (SAS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations can differentiate between different adatom binding sites and determine the location of Ni and Au single atoms on Fe  3  O  4  (001). We reveal that Ni and Au adatoms selectively bind to surface oxygen ions which are octahedrally coordinated to Fe ions. In addition, we find that the Ni adatoms can activate O  2  to superoxide in contrast to the bare surface and Ni in subsurface positions. Overall, we unveil the advantages of combining SAS and DFT for improving the understanding of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Salts: Diversifying Void Structures and Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic salts (POSs) are porous organic materials, in which various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines are regularly selfassembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. POSs exhibit high solubility in highly polar solvents. Therefore, they are prepared via facile recrystallization and exhibit high recyclability. In this study, tetrahedral&#8208;structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (  d  &#8208;POSs) without crystal polymorphism. Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the  para  &#8208;positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of  d  &#8208;POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the  d  &#8208;POSs, which significantly affected their gas absorption behavior. In particular, the  d  &#8208;POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO  2  adsorption of 182 mL(STP)/g at 1 atm in all&#8208;organic porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Siliconoid Expansion by a Single Germanium Atom through Isolated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of (semi&#8208;)metal clusters is pivotal for nucleation processes in gaseous and condensed phases. We now report the isolation of intermediates during the expansion of a stable unsaturated silicon cluster (siliconoid) by a single germanium atom through a sequence of substitution, rearrangement and reduction. The reaction of ligato&#8208;lithiated hexasilabenzpolarene LiSi6Tip5 (1Li.(thf)2, Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl) with GeCl2&#183;NHC (NHC = 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazolylidene) initially yields the product with exohedral germanium(II) functionality, which then inserts into an Si&#8208;Si bond of the Si6 scaffold. The concomitant transfer of the chloro functionality from germanium to an adjacent silicon preserves the electron&#8208;precise nature of the formed endohedral germylene. Full incorporation of the germanium heteroatom to the Si6Ge cluster core is finally achieved either by reduction under loss of the coordinating NHC or directly by reaction of 1Li.(thf)2 with GeCl2&#183;1,4&#8208;dioxane.</dc:description>

         <title>What is the Smallest Zeolite that Could be Synthesized?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with a few unit cells are promising as catalyst and adsorbents. The quest to synthesize the smallest zeolites has recently resulted in 4 to 8 nm nanozeolites, about 2 to 4 unit cells. These findings pose the question of what is the smallest zeolite that could be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Here we address this question using molecular simulations and thermodynamic analysis. The simulations predict that amorphous precursors as small as 4 nm can crystallize zeolites, in agreement with the experiments. We find that interfacial forces dominate the structure of smaller particles, resulting in size&#8208;dependent compact isomers that have ring and pore distributions different from open framework zeolites. The instability of zeolites smaller than 3 &#177; 0.5 nm precludes a classical mechanism of nucleation from solution or through assembly of small nanoslabs.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Helical Assemblies based on Tartaric Acid&#8208;derived Acylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we combined the merits of emergent excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission and circularly polarized luminescence to develop an excitation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence (ExD CPL) material showing unique features. A series of acylhydrazones based on a chiral tartaric skeleton was designed and found to self&#8208;assemble into helical nanostructures through non&#8208;covalent bonds. The helical assemblies showed ExD CPL due to the cooperation of chirality transfer and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Remarkably, not only the emission wavelength could be tuned by excitation wavelength but the handedness of CPL could be modulated in an inverted or ON/OFF manner as well, thus leading to the first example of an ExD inverted or ON/OFF switchable CPL system. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to explain the inversion of ExD CPL. This work provided a new insight into the unprecedented handedness controllable ExD CPL, which showcased a new paradigm of the advanced CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of Breslow Intermediates from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Aldehydes Involves Autocatalysis by the Breslow Intermediate, and a Hemiacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under aprotic conditions, Breslow intermediates can be generated from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes such as imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes ((hyphenation: &#8220;imidazol&#8208;idin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes&#8221;)) and aldehydes. But how is the intermediary &#8220;primary adduct&#8221; (PA) converted to the diaminoenol (BI)? Our kinetic study shows that the highly unfavorable 1,2&#8208;C&#8208;to&#8208;O H&#8208;shift is autocatalyzed ((hyphenation: &#8220;au&#8208;to&#8208;cata&#8208;lyzed&#8221;)) by the Breslow intermediate, and that a hemiacetal plays a crucial role in the presence of excess aldehyde.







Abstract
Under aprotic conditions, the stoichiometric reaction of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) such as imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes with aldehydes affords Breslow Intermediates (BIs), involving a formal 1,2&#8208;C&#8208;to&#8208;O proton shift. We herein report kinetic studies (NMR), complemented by DFT calculations, on the mechanism of this kinetically disfavored H&#8208;translocation. Variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) revealed that the kinetic orders of the reactants vary for different NHC&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde ratios, indicating different and ratio&#8208;dependent mechanistic regimes. We propose that for high NHC&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde ratios, the H&#8208;shift takes place in the primary, zwitterionic NHC&#8208;aldehyde adduct. With excess aldehyde, the zwitterion is in equilibrium with a hemiacetal, in which the H&#8208;shift occurs. In both regimes, the critical H&#8208;shift is auto&#8208;catalyzed by the BI. Kinetic isotope effects observed for R&#8208;CDO are in line with our proposal. Furthermore, we detected an H&#8208;bonded complex of the BI with excess NHC (NMR).

         <title>Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Inorganic Chiral Photonic Crystals Doped with Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral semiconductor nanostructures have received enormous attention due to their emerging properties of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, compared with well&#8208;studied photoluminescence (PL), the reported CPL is much weaker and challenging to be modulated. Herein, we describe a new approach to acquiring the intense and tunable CPL from inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) doped with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Unprecedentedly, the sign, position and intensity of CPL peaks can be precisely controlled by manipulating either the photonic bandgap of CPCs or luminescence wavelength of QDs and a giant absolute dissymmetry factor |  g  lum  | up to 0.25 is obtained. More importantly, the origin of CPL modulation is clearly elucidated by both experiment and theory. This work lays the foundation for the construction of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance CPL&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborate: A Non&#8208;conjugated Fluorescent Polymer with Unanticipated High Quantum Yield and Multicolor Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers have attracted great attention due to their excellent biocompatibility and environmental friendliness. However, it remains a huge challenge to obtain a polymer with high fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and multicolor emission simultaneously. Herein, we report three kinds of nonaromatic hyperbranched polyborates (P1&#8208;P3) with multicolor emission, surprisingly, P2 also exhibits an unanticipated high QY of 54.1%. The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed that the synergistic effect of rigid BO  3  planar and flexible carbon chain, as well as the through&#8208;space dative bond in supramolecular aggregate, were the key factors contributing to the ultrahigh QY of P2. Moreover, the applications of P2 in Fe  3+  ions detection and cell imaging were also investigated. This work provides a new perspective for designing non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers with both high QY and multicolor emission.</dc:description>

         <title>A Silylene&#8208;Stabilized Germanium Analogue of Alkynylaluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;developed metal acetylides, the heavier analogues of the type REEM (E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; M = metals) have not been reported to date. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a silylene&#8208;stabilized germanium analogue of alkynylaluminum (4) by the reaction of a silylene&#8208;stabilized digermavinylidene (3) with 0.25 equiv. of (AlCp*)4 in THF at 80 &#176;C. The structure of  4  has been unambiguously characterized by spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and DFT calculations, and features a linear AlGeGe skeleton with a Ge=Ge double bond and a polarized Ge&#8722;Al bond. Complex  4  shows excellent reactivity towards small molecules such as H2, CS2 and TolNCO, and this allows for the construction of the structurally intriguing germylenyl aluminum complex (5) and the germacycles (6,7).</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Protonation for the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Synergistic Effect of the Counterion and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective tandem Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;alkynylketoamides with diarylphosphine oxides was achieved with a  N,N  &#160;  '&#8208;dioxide/Sc  III  complex as the catalyst. This protocol features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and good functional&#8208;group compatibility, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted allenes with a diarylphosphinate functionality in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 97% yield, 96%  ee  ). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that a synergistic effect of the counterion and water was critical for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement.

         <title>One&#8208;step C2H4 Purification from Ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 Mixtures by a Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#160;with Customized Pore Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step C2H4 purification from ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures by a single adsorbent is of great industrial significance, but few adsorbents achieved this separation. Herein, we report a robust metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that possesses the methyl&#8208;decorated nonpolar pores and shows one&#8208;step C2H4 purification (purity &gt; 99.9%) from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures and ternary C2H6/C2H4/C2H2 mixtures. The methyl groups in pores provide a suitable pore environment to simultaneously enhance the adsorption capacity for C2H2 and C2H6 compared to C2H4. Simulations revealed the multiple interactions between C2H6 or C2H2 molecules and the pore walls, while the interactions with C2H4 molecules are weak and also unfavorable due to the repulsion from methyl groups in pores. The MOF displays high C2H6 and C2H2 uptakes and benchmark C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.2), surpassing all of the reported MOFs for one&#8208;step&#160;C2H4&#160;purification from ternary&#160;C2H6/C2H4/C2H2&#160;mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes Using Triethylgermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling is disclosed herein, relying on organogermane&#8208;containing building blocks paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction, which allows to significantly shorten the reaction times and close gaps in the accessible compound space.







Abstract
While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.







Abstract
While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>

A stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt(IV) complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold is very active in the catalysis of water oxidation at an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV at pH=6.







Abstract
Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the CoIV center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high spin state (sextet, S=5/2). The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated based on theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments.

&lt;p&gt;A stable water-soluble cobalt(IV) complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;-([2,2&#8242;-bipyridine]-6,6&#8242;-diyl)bis(propan-2-ol) ligand scaffold is very active in the catalysis of water oxidation at an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV at pH=6.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present a stable water-soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;-([2,2&#8242;-bipyridine]-6,6&#8242;-diyl)bis(propan-2-ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high-oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the Co&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high spin state (sextet, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=5/2). The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single-site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated based on theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important regarding the accessibility of high-oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shell&#8208;like Xenon Nano&#8208;Traps within Angular Anion&#8208;Pillared Layered Porous Materials for Boosting Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shell&#8208;like nano traps for xenon were prepared by exploiting the shape and size of tetrahedral MO42&#8722; pillar ligands. This approach gives a high degree of confinement and multiple interactions in close proximity which enhance the affinity towards Xe.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is a promising technique but remains a daunting challenge since they are atomic gases without dipole or quadruple moments. Herein we report a strategy for fabricating angular anion&#8208;pillared materials featuring shell&#8208;like Xe nano&#8208;traps, which provide a cooperative effect conferred by the pore confinement and multiple specific interactions. The perfect permanent pore channel (4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197;) of Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2MO4 (M=Cr, Mo, W) can host Xe atoms efficiently even at ultra&#8208;low concentration (400&#8197;ppm Xe), showing the second&#8208;highest selectivity of 30.2 in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2WO4 and excellent Xe adsorption capacity in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2CrO4 (15.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Crystallography studies and DFT&#8208;D calculations revealed the energy favorable binding sites and angular anions enable the synergism between optimal pore size and polar porosity for boosting Xe affinity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated three MOFs as efficient adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface with oxygen plasma assists the formation of highly dense and stable Pt single atoms resistant to sintering under CO oxidation conditions. The effect is assigned to plasma&#8208;induced oxide nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo species which favor single&#8208;atom metal adsorption. This approach can be utilized for the preparation of stable single&#8208;atom catalysts with a high density of active sites.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO2 films and theory, we show that the O2 plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O22&#8722;) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt2+ atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on powder Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple molecular barcoding strategy is proposed based on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic DNA oligomers and direct nanopore decoding. The composition of the barcode probe is highly programmable, and in principle 14n unique step&#8208;shaped barcode patterns can be generated without nanopore sequencing. Different protein and microRNA targets were identified using this strategy, showing its generality in single molecule sensing.







Abstract
A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14n unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation already at room temperature. The high chemical reactivity of nitrogen oxides species, eventually present in the residual gas background, and of the possible reaction intermediates yields a challenging complexity, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.







Abstract
Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced NiI&#8208; and FeIII&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.

         <title>Oxidase&#8208;Type C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Coupling Using an Isoquinoline&#8208;Derived Organic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst was designed and synthesized. This photocatalyst enabled visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with alkanes and aldehydes using air as the sole oxidant. An unconventional mechanism with &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; to generate an isoquinoline N&#8208;radical cation to trigger hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is involved, according to time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopic and mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;type oxidation is an attractive strategy in organic synthesis due to the use of O2 as the terminal oxidant. Organic photocatalysis can effect metal&#8208;free oxidase chemistry. Nevertheless, current methods are limited in reaction scope, possibly due to the lack of suitable photocatalysts. Here we report an isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst, which has much enhanced absorption of blue and visible light compared to conventional diaryl ketones. This photocatalyst enables dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited&#8208;state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; process to generate the N&#8208;radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Condensation of [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; Metalloligand in Stepwise Assembly of Hexagonal and Rectangular Ag18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Ag18 nanoclusters with different geometries are isolated by employing the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; metalloligand. The condensation degree of the metalloligand was strongly dependent on the alcohols. In the absence of alcohols, the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; can be controllably cyclized to form a wheel&#8208;like [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; to trap silver ions. In contrast, the similar cyclization reaction is completely blocked in the presence of alcohols.







Abstract
Stepwise assembly starting from a preassembled metalloligand is a promising approach to obtain otherwise unattainable silver nanoclusters, but hard to be intrinsically identified due to the lack of convincing evidence to justify such a process. Herein, hexagonal and rectangular Ag18 nanoclusters are constructed from the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; (H4PTC4A=p&#8208;phenyl&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene) metalloligand through stepwise assembly. The formation of the metalloligand is confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, then assembled with silver ions to form two geometrically different Ag18 nanoclusters in different solvents. The cyclization from the metalloligand to [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; can be realized without alcohols and otherwise blocked by them. The installation of this metalloligand not only provides comprehensive understanding of how the solvents regulate the silver nanocluster structures, but also brings new insights for the controllable ligand metallization and subsequent condensation.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Decarboxylative Hydroaminoalkylation of Dienol Ethers Enabled by Dual Palladium/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) reaction of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;amino acids with dienol ethers enabled by a photoredox/palladium dual catalytic system is presented. With the developed method, a broad variety of substrates was deployed to deliver vicinal amino tertiary ethers in good to excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a reversible hydropalladation of 1,3&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAA reactions, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAA of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method enables the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for a few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed peri&#8208;Selective Direct Alkenylations with Weak O&#8208;Coordination Enabled by the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation&#8208;sensitive 1&#8208;naphthols as well as 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity, with molecular H2 as the only stoichiometric waste product.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp2)&#8208;directing groups.

&lt;p&gt;A rhodium-catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation-sensitive 1-naphthols as well as 4- and 5-hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site- and stereoselectivity, with molecular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the only stoichiometric waste product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly-coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H alkenylations of challenging 1-naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis via user-friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily-available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site- and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high-value, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ratiometric and Colorimetric Optical Thermometers Using Emissive Dimeric and Trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}n Moieties Generated in d&#8211;f Heterometallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 ions were incorporated in two different supramolecular matrices with GdIII and YIII. The resulting materials exhibit characteristic Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational peaks investigated by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The formation of Au2 and Au3 moieties yields strong photoluminescence with rich color tunability, providing high&#8208;performance colorimetric and ratiometric thermometer abilities.







Abstract
Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au2]&#8594;[Au2]*) and exciplexes ([Au3]&#8594;[Au3]*) with light excitation. Four GdIII and YIII complexes were assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational mode was probed with ultralow frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy was used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions were associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence measurements showed that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green via cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as colorimetric thermometers. Additionally, a ratiometric thermal sensing ability was incorporated with high sensitivity up to 5&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the cryogenic temperature range.

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small changes in the elasticity of the inherently soft radiolabeled nanogels show major differences in its in vivo circulation half&#8208;life. Longer circulation life renders a higher possibility for nanogels to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment by enhanced permeation and retention effect.







Abstract
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37&#8197;kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93&#8197;kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>

n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (up to 35&#8197;h) for the generation of intense anti&#8208;Stokes photoinduced electrochemiluminescence onto the whole surface of the metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) photoanode or at a specifically&#8208;chosen location. These results provide solutions for overcoming the instability that has hampered the practical application of upconversion photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL).







Abstract
Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiOx/metal (SiOx/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.

         <title>A New Platform of B/N&#8208;Doped Cyclophanes: Access to a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Block&#8208;Type B3N3 Macrocycle with Strong Dipole Moment and Unique Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual block&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 that shows a strong dipole moment and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is introduced. Compared with other cyclic hexamers, its unique orientation of electron&#8208;donor block and acceptor block resulted in largely red&#8208;shifted orange emission both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar3N) and an acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar3B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the block&#8208;type macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites, MC&#8208;alt&#8208;B3N3. The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar3B and amine donor Ar3N components in MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612&#8197;nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer L&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8211;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.

&lt;p&gt;An unusual &lt;i&gt;block&lt;/i&gt;-type &#960;-conjugated macrocycle &lt;b&gt;MC&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;B3N3&lt;/b&gt; that shows a strong dipole moment and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is introduced. Compared with other cyclic hexamers, its unique orientation of electron-donor block and acceptor block resulted in largely red-shifted orange emission both in solution and in the solid state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N-doped cyclophane where an electron-donor block of three triarylamines (Ar&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and an acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;-extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the &lt;i&gt;block&lt;/i&gt;-type macrocycle &lt;b&gt;MC-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-B3N3&lt;/b&gt; with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites, &lt;b&gt;MC-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-B3N3&lt;/b&gt;. The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B and amine donor Ar&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N components in &lt;b&gt;MC-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-B3N3&lt;/b&gt; induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red-shifted luminescence at 612&#8197;nm in solution. The respective linear open-chain oligomer &lt;b&gt;L-&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-B3N3&lt;/b&gt; was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8211;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Basis for the Prenylation Reaction of Carbazole&#8208;Containing Natural Products Catalyzed by Squalene Synthase&#8208;Like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole prenyltransferase was found to combine the overall structure of squalene synthase and the elegant stacking interaction between prenyl diphosphate and aromatic compounds observed in the aromatic substrate prenyltransferase. Structural and mutational analyses revealed the binding and deprotonation mechanisms of the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor.







Abstract
Some enzymes annotated as squalene synthase catalyze the prenylation of carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone&#8208;containing substrates in bacterial secondary metabolism. Their reaction mechanisms remain unclear because of their low sequence similarity to well&#8208;characterized aromatic substrate prenyltransferases (PTs). We determined the crystal structures of the carbazole PTs, and these revealed that the overall structure is well superposed on those of squalene synthases. In contrast, the stacking interaction between the prenyl donor and acceptor substrates resembles those observed in aromatic substrate PTs. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the Ile and Asp residues are essential for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor, respectively, and a deprotonation mechanism of an intermediary &#963;&#8208;complex involving a catalytic triad is proposed. Our results provide a structural basis for a new subclass of aromatic substrate PTs.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and programmable triple fluorescence switching in the solid state was demonstrated through an alternative &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; optical manipulation strategy employing a spiropyran&#8208;functionalized distyrylanthracene derivative. The unique switching ability enabled innovative multicolor, tunable, switching cell imaging and two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging in a single&#8208;molecule system.







Abstract
In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>A Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst for the Polymerization of Olefins Prepared by Halide Abstraction Using Surface R3Si+ Species</title>

A silylium&#8208;like ion supported on silica ionizes a Pd&#8722;Cl complex by chloride abstraction to generate a very active catalyst for (co&#8208;)polymerization reactions.







Abstract
The silylium&#8208;like surface species [iPr3Si][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] activates (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl (N^N=Ar&#8722;N=CMeMeC=N&#8722;Ar, Ar=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzene) by chloride ion abstraction to form [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] (1). A combination of FTIR, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and reactions with CO or vinyl chloride establish that 1 shows similar reactivity patterns as (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl activated with Na[B(ArF)4]. Multinuclear 13C{27Al} RESPDOR and 1H{19F} S&#8208;REDOR experiments are consistent with a weakly coordinated ion&#8208;pair between (N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3+ and [(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)]. 1 catalyzes the polymerization of ethylene with similar activities as [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3]+ in solution and incorporates up to 0.4&#8201;% methyl acrylate in copolymerization reactions. 1 produces polymers with significantly higher molecular weight than the solution catalyst, and generates the highest molecular weight polymers currently reported in copolymerization reactions of ethylene and methylacrylate.

         <title>Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex de novo biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides was reorganized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through the addition of an excess amount of a cofactor provided by a cofactor regeneration system, thus resulting in high synthetic yields.







Abstract
Glycosylation is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases using sugar nucleotides or occasionally lipid&#8208;linked phosphosugars as donors. However, only very few common sugar nucleotides that occur in humans can be obtained readily, while the majority of sugar nucleotides that exist in bacteria, plants, archaea, or viruses cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by either enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The limited availability of such rare sugar nucleotides is one of the major obstacles that has greatly hampered progress in glycoscience. Herein we describe a general cofactor&#8208;driven cascade conversion strategy for the efficient synthesis of sugar nucleotides. The described strategy allows the large&#8208;scale preparation of rare sugar nucleotides from common sugars in high yields and without the need for tedious purification processes.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitution of Methyl Azaarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution of a variety of methyl azaarenes, including (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline, is described. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are afforded in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Herein, an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction of methyl azaarenes is described. Azaarenes such as (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline are all tolerated. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The utilization of the Knochel reagent TMPZnBr&#8901;LiBr warrants the in situ formation of benzylic nucleophiles without additional activating reagents. 1H&#8197;NMR studies suggested a two&#8208;fold function of the Knochel reagent in this reaction. The synthetic utility of this method has been showcased by a concise enantioselective synthesis of an allosteric protein kinase modulator.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyoligosaccharides Enabled by Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photoglycosylation is reported that proceeds through a bromide&#8208;based hydrogen species and electron transfer process. The value of this protocol was well demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of oligosaccharides on a gram scale as well as digoxin and a 20&#8208;mer deoxyglycan in good yields and with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8722;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2&#8197;min in a high quantum yield (&#981;=28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.

         <title>Spatially Resolved, Error&#8208;Robust Multiplexed MicroRNA Profiling in Single Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;encoded error&#8208;corrected label (FluoEL) for multiplexed microRNA imaging in living cells is developed. Proportionally encoded Cy3 and Cy5 overcome the limitation of spectral overlap. The core&#8211;shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) structure avoids FRET between the recognition component of the molecular beacon (MB) and the barcoding dye to provide high accuracy.







Abstract
Simultaneous imaging of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in individual living cells is challenging due to the lack of spectrally distinct encoded fluorophores and non&#8208;cytotoxic methods. We describe a multiplexed error&#8208;robust combinatorial fluorescent label&#8208;encoding method, termed fluorophores encoded error&#8208;corrected labels (FluoELs), enabling multiplexed miRNA imaging in living cells with error&#8208;correcting capability. The FluoELs comprise proportional dual fluorophores for encoding and a constant quantitative single fluorophore for error&#8208;corrected quantification. Both are embedded in 260&#8197;nm core&#8211;shell silica nanoparticles modified with molecular beacon detection probes. The FluoELs are low cytotoxic and could accurately quantify and spatially resolve nine breast&#8208;cancer&#8208;related miRNAs and evaluate their coordination. The FluoELs enabled a single&#8208;cell analysis platform to evaluate miRNA expression profiles and the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Based Complex Fluids as Aqueous Exciton Transport Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions are fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. Complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid in which energy transfer is highly efficient.







Abstract
The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus&#8208;Targeting PtIV Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The example of PtIV nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The complex was functionalized with a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII, presenting a multimodal treatment by chemotherapy and photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their PtII therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the example of PtIV&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with PtIV complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to eradicate a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.

Upon irradiation, the Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; center is reduced to Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to eradicate a triple-negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosted Inner Surface Charge Transfer in Perovskite Nanodots@Mesoporous Titania Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9, Cs2AgBiBr6) are grown in situ in a mesoporous titania framework for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A benchmarked production rate of CH4 (32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) is achieved with selectivity values of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, respectively. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy reveal that the inner surface built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels can efficiently promote photo&#8208;induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency and stable halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to methane is a challenge because of the intrinsic photo&#8208; and chemical instability of halide perovskites. In this study, halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs2AgBiBr6) were grown in situ in mesoporous TiO2 frameworks for an efficient CO2 reduction. Benchmarked CH4 production rates of 32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivities of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, were achieved, respectively, which are better than most reported halide perovskite photocatalysts. Focused ion&#8208;beam sliced&#8208;imaging techniques were used to directly image the hyperdispersed perovskite nanodots confined in mesopores with tunable sizes ranging from 3.8 to 9.9&#8197;nm. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy showed that the built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels efficiently promoted photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high methane selectivity was attributed to the Bi&#8208;adsorption&#8208;mediated hydrogenation of *CO to *HCO that dominates CO desorption.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Tunable Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligands: Application to the Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine scaffold SBpy was rationally designed and enabled a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. This approach is more step&#8208;economic than conventional strategies and allowed the preparation of various diaryl carbinols without the need to use preformed metallic reagents.







Abstract
A new class of chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands, SBpy, featuring minimized short&#8208;range steric hindrance and structural tunability was rationally designed and developed, and the effectiveness was demonstrated in the first highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. In comparison with known approaches using preformed aryl metallic reagents, this reaction is more step&#8208;economical and functional group tolerant. The reaction mechanism and a model of stereocontrol were proposed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening is a multiplexed widefield screening approach for particle characterization. The method is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations and simultaneously measures SERS and particle size.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle characterization, which is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample's Raman and Rayleigh scattering to directly quantify the fraction of SERS&#8208;active particles which allows for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with particle size. .

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron deficiency&#8208;induced neurochemical changes are linked to cognitive impairment. Alteration in plasticity is observed as a decrease in fractional release during repetitive stimulation and iron deficiency. This alteration in fractional release is likely to be one of the mechanisms that underlie the negative impact of iron deficiency on plasticity, and the long&#8208;term deficits in learning and memory.







Abstract
Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity by altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulation. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation. This provides a putative mechanism for how iron deficiency modulates plasticity.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
General and efficient asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles has been realized using a well&#8208;defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 99&#8201;% ee and a record TON of 72&#8201;350 in an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters.

     alt="Manganese-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H-Indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General and efficient asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-indoles has been realized using a well-defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 99&#8201;% ee and a record TON of 72&#8201;350 in an earth-abundant metal-catalyzed AH reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn-catalyzed AH of &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic &lt;i&gt;3H&lt;/i&gt;-indoles by AH was also achieved with high s-factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid-sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state-of-the-art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth-abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72&#8201;350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth-abundant metal-catalyzed AH reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of NO3&#8722; is achieved by connecting NO3&#8722; to an ether&#8208;based moiety. The broken resonance structure of &#8722;NO3 improves its reducibility compared with NO3&#8722;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO3 forms a LiNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8722; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8722; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8722;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate shape evolution is proposed. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories of NPs. The theory accommodates the conventional theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Fluorescent Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Atom&#8208;Precise Cu8 Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the scheme of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), optical&#8208;engineering was performed for real&#8208;time monitoring of the self&#8208;assembly process of Cu8a with various kinetic long&#8208;lived intermediates, leading to a structure&#8211;property relationship being established.







Abstract
Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in monitoring the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise CuI nanocluster [Cu8(tBuC6H4S)8(PPh3)4] (Cu8a) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of Cu8a is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (CD) to Cu8a aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.

         <title>Back Cover: Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar nucleotides are essential glycosylation donors in carbohydrate metabolism. In their Research Article (e202115696), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of rare sugar nucleotides. Complex de&#8197;novo biosynthesis of rare sugar nucleotides was recognized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through a cofactor regeneration system (CRS), thus resulting in clean conversion.

In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202115696"&gt;(e202115696)&lt;/a&gt;, Liuqing Wen and co-workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of rare sugar nucleotides. Complex de&#8197;novo biosynthesis of rare sugar nucleotides was recognized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through a cofactor regeneration system (CRS), thus resulting in clean conversion.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanical properties of nanogels influence their cellular fate. Inspired by the natural ability of the cells to sense stiffness, Smriti Singh et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202116653) developed highly hydrophilic soft nanogels and show that the passive engulfment of the soft nanogels by the immune cells was drastically reduced compared to the stiffer counterpart. The delayed uptake resulted in an enhanced circulation time of the nanogels, an important criterion for drug delivery applications.

         <dc:description>
A series of sulfur species prodrugs (reactive sulfur species in a capsule) that can release pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) was used by Bowen Ke et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202201668) to compare the pharmacological differences between sulfide and persulfide. The H2S2 prodrug exhibits increased activities and reduced toxicity as compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on the field at the junction of inkjet printing and high&#8208;tech applications in optoelectronics, energy production and storage, and (bio)detection. We assess the micro&#8208; and nanostructuring inkjet printing methods and answer the following questions: What are the current strategies to improve the resolution of printed patterns? To what extent can advances in nanochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and surface chemistry be integrated into printing strategies?







Abstract
Driven by the development of new functional inks, inkjet&#8208;printed electronics has achieved several milestones upon moving from the integration of simple electronic elements (e.g., temperature and pressure sensors, RFID antennas, etc.) to high&#8208;tech applications (e.g. in optoelectronics, energy storage and harvesting, medical diagnosis). Currently, inkjet printing techniques are limited by spatial resolution higher than several micrometers, which sets a redhibitorythreshold for miniaturization and for many applications that require the controlled organization of constituents at the nanometer scale. In this Review, we present the physico&#8208;chemical concepts and the equipment constraints underpinning the resolution limit of inkjet printing and describe the contributions from molecular, supramolecular, and nanomaterials&#8208;based approaches for their circumvention. Based on these considerations, we propose future trajectories for improving inkjet&#8208;printing resolution that will be driven and supported by breakthroughs coming from chemistry. Please check all text carefully as extensive language polishing was necessary. Title ok? Yes

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a renaissance in the activation of carborane cages in the past decades, oxidative cage functionalizations generally require stoichiometric amounts of toxic chemical oxidants. In contrast, electrochemical functionalizations enable resource&#8208;economical cage activation.

Carboranes are boron&#8211;carbon molecular clusters that possess unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content, and delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications in supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, organometallic coordination chemistry, and as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for the oxidative activation of carborane cages. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. It is only in recent few years that considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this Minireview. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will serve as an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry.

Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported.







Abstract
Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)6] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H2 and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization that competes with substrate assembly is an important aspect of anti&#8208;aggregation chaperones that remains poorly understood. Using the J domain chaperone DNAJB6, how the Parkinson's related T193A mutation affects chaperone oligomerization has been explored. The C&#8208;terminal domain of DNAJB6b exhibits significant microsecond dynamics that are enhanced in the T193A mutant, leading to a monomeric partially&#8208;folded state.







Abstract
DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of &#8776;100&#8197;&#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics, oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.

         <title>Leveraging Electron&#8208;Deficient Iminium Intermediates in a General Synthesis of Valuable Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of aminals as precursors for iminium ions has been limited to methylene derivatives, thus hampering its broader use. By employing electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions an obvious hurdle of the methodology is overcome, whilst generating highly desirable motifs. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.







Abstract
The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanopore sensing assay is developed to resolve cascade reactions of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. In a confined environment such as liposomes, substrate&#8208;channelling effects are observed between two sets of the three enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channelling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8211;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channelling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channelling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.

A precious metal&#8208;free photocatalyst PS&#8208;CAT consisting of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic was utilized in the scope of hydrogen generation under visible light. The dyad comprising a &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophene as light absorber shows a remarkably high photocatalytic activity. In accordance with theory, operando EPR spectroscopy using BIH as sacrificial donor reveals the generation of an active [FeIFe0] species during the irradiation experiment.







Abstract
Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. PS&#8208;CAT represents a prototype dyad comprising &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers. PS&#8208;CAT and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations. Operando EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of an active [FeIFe0] species&#8212;in accordance with theoretical calculations&#8212;presumably driving photocatalysis effectively (TON&#8776;210).

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal-free photosensitizer-catalyst dyad (&lt;b&gt;PS-CAT&lt;/b&gt;) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. &lt;b&gt;PS-CAT&lt;/b&gt; represents a prototype dyad comprising &#960;-conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers. &lt;b&gt;PS-CAT&lt;/b&gt; and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light-driven photocatalytic investigations. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of an active [Fe&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;] species&#8212;in accordance with theoretical calculations&#8212;presumably driving photocatalysis effectively (TON&#8776;210).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion was synthesized. This compound exhibits an extremely elongated bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a near&#8208;IR absorption (&#955;max=922&#8197;nm) in solution attributed to the HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. Furthermore, this silicon radical anion presents a new bonding motif which appears to be the first example of a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221;.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Type 3&#8208;electron&#8208;2&#8208;center (3e&#8208;2c) bonds have been extensively studied as one of the key bonding motifs in radical chemistry and some biological systems. &#8220;&#960;&#8208;Type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221; that contain a 3e&#8208;2c &#960;&#8208;bond without an underlying &#963;&#8208;bond framework, however, have been unexplored so far both theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a strong near&#8208;IR absorption at 922&#8197;nm in solution which arises from a HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;&#8208;type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*&#8208;type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>Building a Beyond Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly aggregated ether electrolyte is rationally constructed by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. Benefitting from the highly aggregated electrolyte configuration, it enables a dramatically improved oxidative stability. Under the extremely harsh anode&#8208;free conditions, the high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Na battery configuration has an ultrahigh energy density of 369&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0&#8197;V class cathodes.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate for the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration comprising a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. A 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It suppresses the trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5&#8197;V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91&#8201;%). Thus, we can make anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells.

         <title>Direct Dehydrogenative Access to Unsymmetrical Phenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction is an emblematic method for constructing C&#8722;C bonds at aromatic positions. Rendering this reaction dehydrogenative on a broad scope of substrates under simple reaction conditions constitutes an important milestone for synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The first non&#8208;directed dehydrogenative phenone coupling method of methylarenes with aromatic C&#8722;H bonds, displaying a large substrate scope, is herein reported. This reaction represents a far more direct atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient alternative to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura derived acylation reactions. The method can be carried out on a gram scale and was successfully applied to the synthesis of several Ketoprofen drug analogues.

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM), including crystallographic analysis, is described. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM causes its high reactivity, making it capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl group. This study paves an avenue for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.







Abstract
Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a 1,2&#8208;disilylene with CO under ambient conditions leads to a bis(silylene), the five&#8208;membered heterocycle of which represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (see picture). Reactions of the bis(silylene) with transition metal carbonyls lead to different outcomes, including a chelate complex of the Mo(CO)4 fragment.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylene, [{ArC(NDip)2}Si]2 1 (Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But), with CO proceeds via insertion of CO into one Si&#8722;N bond, and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage, to cleanly give the bis(silylene), {ArC(NDip)2}Si(:)O
 Ar 2, under ambient conditions. The reaction can be partially reversed when solutions of 2 are subjected to UV irradiation. The five&#8208;membered heterocyclic fragment of 2 represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC), a view which is substantiated by a computational analysis of the compound. Reaction of 2 with [Mo(CO)6] under UV light affords the chelate complex, [Mo(CO)4(&#954;2&#8208;Si,Si&#8208;2)] 3, while reaction with [Fe(CO)5] gives the unusual silyleneyl bridged complex, [{Fe2(CO)6}{&#956;&#8208;Si[(NDip)2CAr]}2] 4. The same coordination complexes can be accessed by reaction of 1 with [Mo(CO)6] or [Fe(CO)5] under UV light. As is the case for aNHCs, d&#8208;block metal complexes of bis(silylene) 2 could prove useful as bespoke catalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delivery system which can release pure H2S, hydrogen persulfide, and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide was used to compare the pharmacological difference of sulfide and persulfide. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.







Abstract
Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug. In particular, the H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEASCN (2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate) was synthesized to construct a bilayer structure on a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite surface, which can passivate perovskite and ensure effective carrier transfer, enabling the device to reach a certified efficiency of 21.1&#8201;%. The mechanism for the growth of the uniform bilayer structure is revealed by simulation based on density functional theory.







Abstract
The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. A 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large band gap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on a tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate the perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow band gap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN makes the bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structures.

         <title>Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology that enables the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified proteins at high dilution is described. EPSL involves the one&#8208;pot conversion of protein acyl hydrazides (derived from recombinant intein fusion precursors) to protein aryl selenoesters, followed by ligation with synthetic modified selenopeptides and chemoselective deselenization.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development and application of a novel expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology for the one&#8208;pot semi&#8208;synthesis of modified proteins. EPSL harnesses the rapid kinetics of ligation reactions between modified synthetic selenopeptides and protein aryl selenoesters (generated from expressed intein fusion precursors) followed by in situ chemoselective deselenization to afford target proteins at concentrations that preclude the use of traditional ligation methods. The utility of the EPSL technology is showcased through the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of ubiquitinated polypeptides, lipidated analogues of the membrane&#8208;associated GTPase YPT6, and site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated variants of the oligomeric chaperone protein Hsp27 at high dilution.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Switchable Copolymerization of Lactide, Carbon Dioxide, and Epoxides</title>

An electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides to easily synthesize multi&#8208;block copolymers of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC).







Abstract
Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical redox-control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen-Co-Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi-block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi-block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Addition of Aryl Iodides across Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective aryl&#8208;addition has been accomplished using a combination of aryl iodides and aldehydes via asymmetric nickel catalysis. These mild catalytic conditions provide a new strategy for the enantioselective construction of secondary alcohols, avoiding the use of organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
Enantioenriched alcohols comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. Here, we first report that chiral nickel complexes can catalyze the intermolecular enantioselective addition of aryl iodides across aldehydes to provide diverse optically active secondary alcohols using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This method shows a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions and precludes the traditional strategy through the pre&#8208;generation of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ formed arylnickel, instead of an arylzinc, adds efficiently to aldehydes, forming a new C&#8722;C bond and a chiral nickel alkoxide that may be turned over by zinc powder.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene Stabilized Disilicon(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex was synthesized and characterized, which revealed a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding. Its reaction with phenylacetylene gave the structurally interesting silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene and reveals new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino&#8208;substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2&#8197;equiv) in THF at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C leads to a silylene&#8208;ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60&#8201;% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si0 atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium superionic conductor with low activation energy: W&#8208;doped K3SbS4 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional K migration pathway and a low activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature and is then used in K&#8722;S batteries to block the polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K3SbS4 with a low&#8208;activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. W&#8208;doped K3&#8722;xSb1&#8722;xWxS4 (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 is electrochemically stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K2Sx. A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8722;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Specific O&#8208;Selective Hydropyridonation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;IPr catalyst was reported for the synthesis of gem&#8208;O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;oxypyridines by selective O&#8208;addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. A preferable N&#8208;coordination mode within the metallacyclopropene intermediate species causes a seesaw effect responsible for the O&#8208;nucleophilic attack.







Abstract
The dinuclear complex [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)(IPr)]2 is an efficient catalyst for the O&#8208;selective Markovnikov&#8208;type addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. DFT calculations support a hydride&#8208;free pathway entailing intramolecular oxidative protonation of a &#960;&#8208;alkyne by a &#954;1N&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand. Subsequent O&#8208;nucleophilic attack on a metallacyclopropene species affords an O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxypyridine chelate rhodium intermediate as the catalyst resting state. The release of the alkenyl ether is calculated as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method for the straightforward synthesis of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported via an unprecedented, redox&#8208;neutral Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation. A rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor delivers the monocyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) species.







Abstract
A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as the underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble perylene diimide (PDI) cyclophane consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double cationic molecular straps has been synthesized. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, self&#8208;aggregation of the chromophore in water is completely eliminated, which enables the cyclophane to be employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging and antibacterial applications.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double&#8208;sided cationic molecular straps. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2&#8197;mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic fabrication (left) is used to prepare a two aqueous phase microcapsule (right), which releases a model drug payload on demand in response to focused ultrasound actuation.







Abstract
Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4&#8197;&#956;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purification of carbon nanodots is a critical aspect in their preparation, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of organic molecules in the final sample can lead to mistaken conclusions regarding their properties. In this work, NMR is proven to be an essential technique to verify the purification of carbon nanodots, thanks to its ability to disclose molecular species.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Zirconocene&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s and Its Extension to Synthesis of a Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Nanobarrel</title>

Low&#8208;valent zirconocene&#8208;mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Rosenthal's&#8208;reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), 6, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 6 and benzdiyne gave adducts 14, 15&#8201;a, and 15&#8201;b along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel 13. Stepwise routes using 14 or 15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of 13 as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for 13 was revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and benzdiyne gave adducts &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;. Stepwise routes using &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; was revealed by X-ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Free Metallophosphines: Extremely Electron&#8208;Rich Phosphorus Superbases that are Electronically and Sterically Tunable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a facile and highly modular access to an intriguing class of free Au&#8208;substituted phosphines (AuPhos), namely (LAu)nPR3&#8208;n (L = singlet carbene ligand; R = H, aryl, alkyl, silyl) (n = 1&#8208;3). The Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) values coupled with theoretical investigations showcase that Au&#8208;substitution can boost the electron&#8208;releasing ability of AuPhos, thus leading to an electronically and sterically tunable, extremely electron&#8208;rich phosphorus center. The high basicity of AuPhos is attributed to the d&#8208;p lone pair &#960;&#8208;repulsion arising from interaction between Au substituents and the lone pair at P. A series of multi&#8208;nuclear transition metal complexes (i.e. Rh, Ir, Pd, Au, W, Mn) ligated by AuPhos are readily prepared via a straightforward process. Preliminary catalytic results reveal the facilitation of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;N coupling reactions and Ir&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylation reactions via AuPhos. This work provides insights for future development of electron&#8208;rich ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Sensitive, Efficient and Portable Analysis of Molecular Exchange Processes by Hyperpolarized Ultrafast NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular exchange processes are ubiquitous in nature. Here, we introduce a method to analyze exchange processes by low&#8208;cost, portable, single&#8208;sided NMR instruments. The inherent magnetic field inhomogeneity of the single&#8208;sided instruments is exploited to achieve diffusion contrast of exchange sites and spatial encoding of 2D data. This so&#8208;called ultrafast diffusion exchange spectroscopy method shortens the experiment time by two to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because full 2D data are measured in a single scan (in a fraction of a second), the sensitivity of the experiment can be improved by several orders of magnitude using so&#8208;called nuclear spin hyperpolarization methods (in this case, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization). As the first demonstration of the feasibility of the method in various applications, we show that the method enables quantification of intra&#8208; and extracellular exchange of water in a yeast cell suspension.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprints of Cavity Formation and Solute Insertion as a Measure of Hydration Entropic Loss and Enthalpic Gain.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Hydration free energies are dictated by a subtle balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. We present here a spectroscopic approach, which gives direct access to the two main contributions: Using THz spectroscopy to probe the frequency range of the intermolecular stretch (150&#8208;200 cm&amp;minus;1) and the hindered rotations (450&#8208;600 cm&amp;minus;1), the local contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back. We show that via THz calorimetry these fingerprints can be correlated 1:1 with the group specific solvation entropy and enthalpy. This allows to deduce separately the hydrophobic (i.e. cavity formation) and hydrophilic contributions to thermodynamics, as shown for hydrated alcohols as a case study. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations quantitatively support our experimental results. In the future our approach will allow to dissect hydration contributions in inhomogeneous mixtures and under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Among sulfoximine derivatives containing a chiral sulfur center, benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides are important for applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Direct conversion of syngas to higher alcohols via tandem integration of Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis and reductive hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective conversion of syngas to higher alcohols is an attractive albeit elusive route in the quest for effective production of chemicals from alternative carbon resources. We report the tandem integration of solid cobalt Fischer&#8208;Tropsch and molecular hydroformylation catalysts in a one&#8208;pot slurry&#8208;phase process. Unprecedented selectivities (&gt;50 wt%) to C  2+  alcohols are achieved at CO conversion levels &gt;70%, alongside negligible CO  2  side&#8208;production. The efficient overall transformation is enabled by catalyst engineering, bridging gaps in operation temperature and intrinsic selectivity which have classically precluded integration of these reactions in a single conversion step. Swift capture of  1  &#8208;olefin Fischer&#8208;Tropsch primary products by the molecular hydroformylation catalyst, presumably within the pores of the solid catalyst is key for high alcohol selectivity. The results underscore that controlled cooperation between solid aggregate and soluble molecular metal catalysts, which pertain to traditionally dichotomic realms of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, is a promising blueprint toward selective conversion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding and Assembly of a Benzotriazole Cavitand in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble cavitand bearing a benzotriazole upper rim was prepared and characterized. It exists as a dimeric velcraplex in D  2  O, but forms host&#8208;guest complexes with hydrophobic and amphiphilic guests. Alkanes (C5 to C10), cyclic ketones (C6&#8208;C10), cyclic alcohols (C6&#8208;C8) and various amphiphilic guests form 1:1 cavitand complexes. A cyclic array of hydrogen bonds, bridged by solvent/water (D  2  O) molecules, stabilizes the vase conformation of the complexes. With longer alkanes (C12&#8208;C15) , symmetrical dialky amines, ureas and phosphates , 2:1 host:guest capsules are formed. Computations indicate that additional waters on the upper rim create a self&#8208;complementary hydrogen bonding pattern for capsule formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphdiyne: A new Carbon Allotrope for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY), a well&#8208;known 2D carbon allotrope, demonstrates increasing fantastic performance in various fields owing to its outstanding electronic properties. With acknowledge of unique property, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology is one powerful tool for understanding fundamental questions and for ultrasensitive sensing and imaging. Here, we firstly find that GDY without any functionalization or treatment shows strong ECL emission with potassium persulfate (K  2  S  2  O  8  ) as coreactant, which is totally different with other carbon allotropes. Mechanistic study indicates that the ECL emission of GDY is generated by the surface state transition. Interestingly, ECL is generated at 705 nm in the near infrared region with an ECL efficiency of 424% compared to that of Ru(bpy)  3  Cl  2  /K  2  S  2  O  8  . The study demonstrates a new character of GDY in ECL investigation and sets the stage for the development of GDY for emerging applications, including imaging and light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Ketone&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is a powerful tool for the synthesis of natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals via the versatile transformations of chiral alkyl boronic esters. However, the scope of available alkenes is limited to styrenes, activated alkenes, and compounds with directing groups. The catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is rarely explored and those catalyzed by earth&#8208;abundant metals are yet to be reported. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of ketone&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers and provide a convenient approach to access valuable enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxy boronic esters. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). This approach was applied in the successful synthesis of salmeterol and albuterol, demonstrating its potential to streamline complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacuum&#8208;Assisted Thermal Annealing of CsPbI3 for Highly Stable and Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Inorganic cesium lead iodide perovskite CsPbI  3  is attracting great attention as a light absorber for single or multi&#8208;junction photovoltaics due to its outstanding thermal stability and proper bandgap. However, the device performance of CsPbI  3  &#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by the unsatisfactory crystal quality and thus severe non&#8208;radiative recombination. Here, vacuum&#8208;assisted thermal annealing (VATA) is demonstrated as an effective approach for controlling the morphology and crystallinity of the CsPbI  3  &#160;perovskite films formed from the precursors of PbI  2  , CsI, and dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI). By this method, a large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality CsPbI  3  film is obtained exhibiting much reduce trap&#8208;state density with prolonged charge lifetime. &#160;Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is raised from 17.26 to 20.06%, along with enhanced stability. The VATA would be an effective approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance thin&#8208;film CsPbI  3  perovskite optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of an Ultrathin Oxide on Pt3Sn(111) Solved by Machine Learning Enhanced Global Optimization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning techniques can be implemented to accelerate surface structure determination based on density functional theory. The application of such an algorithm is demonstrated here for a surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111) which had eluded determination by experimental methods.







Abstract
Determination of the atomic structure of solid surfaces typically depends on comparison of measured properties with simulations based on hypothesized structural models. For simple structures, the models may be guessed, but for more complex structures there is a need for reliable theory&#8208;based search algorithms. So far, such methods have been limited by the combinatorial complexity and computational expense of sufficiently accurate energy estimation for surfaces. However, the introduction of machine learning methods has the potential to change this radically. Here, we demonstrate how an evolutionary algorithm, utilizing machine learning for accelerated energy estimation and diverse population generation, can be used to solve an unknown surface structure&#8212;the (4&#215;4) surface oxide on Pt3Sn(111)&#8212;based on limited experimental input. The algorithm is efficient and robust, and should be broadly applicable in surface studies, where it can replace manual, intuition based model generation.

         <title>Protein Flexibility and Dissociation Pathway Differentiation Can Explain Onset Of Resistance Mutations in Kinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how mutations render a drug ineffective is a problem of immense relevance. Often the mechanism through which mutations cause drug resistance can be explained purely through thermodynamics. However, the more perplexing situation is when two proteins have the same drug binding affinities but different residence times. In this work, we demonstrate how all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti&#8208;cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild&#8208;type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far&#8208;reaching changes in protein&#8217;s flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway.

Often the mechanism through which mutations cause drug resistance can be explained purely through thermodynamics. However, the more perplexing situation is when two proteins have the same drug binding affinities but different residence times. In this work, we demonstrate how all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti-cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild-type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far-reaching changes in protein&#8217;s flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway. We believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to obtain mechanistic insight into resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors that are hard to explain using a structural perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a significant role to modulate polarized light in optical communication and the laser industry. However, the discovery of deep ultraviolet (DUV,  &#955;  &lt; 200 nm) birefringent materials still faces a serious challenge. Herein, we propose hydroxylated  &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] units for designing DUV birefringent materials. Innovatively, four new hydroxyborates have been synthesized under mild synthesis conditions. They present four novel pseudo layers that benefit from a large degree of freedom assembly modes of [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] genes and large birefringence (0.057&#8208;0.123@532 nm). Moreover, The Cs3[B(OH)3]2Cl3  crystal features a short DUV cutoff edge (180 nm), which further indicates that reported compounds are potential DUV birefringent crystals. Free and flexible assembly modes of  &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B(OH)3] and [B3O3(OH)3] groups endow them a particular advantage as significant genes for exploring promising DUV birefringent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Allylic Alcohol Formation by a Multifunctional Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Monooxygenase with Rare Redox Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional cytochrome&#8197;P450 monoxygenase CayG plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic fatty acid caryoynencin in pathogenic bacteria. CayG promotes an unusual desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence to install an allylic alcohol with the help of rare ferredoxin/rubredoxin redox partners. This enzyme system may inspire new multifunctional (bio)catalysts for regio&#8208; and stereoselective modifications of saturated carbon backbones.







Abstract
Caryoynencin is a toxic and antifungal fatty acid derivative produced by a number of plant&#8208;pathogenic and insect&#8208;protective bacteria (Trinickia caryophylli and Burkholderia spp.). In addition to the reactive tetrayne unit, the presence of an allylic alcohol moiety is critical for antimicrobial activities. By a combination of mutational analyses, heterologous expression and in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that the cytochrome&#8197;P450 monooxygenase CayG catalyzes the complex transformation of a saturated carbon backbone into an allylic alcohol. Unexpectedly, CayG employs a ferritin&#8208;like protein (CayK) or a rubredoxin (CayL) component for electron transport. A desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence was deduced from a time&#8208;course study and in vitro biotransformations with pathway intermediates, substrate analogues, protegencin congeners from Pseudomonas protegens Pf&#8208;5, and synthetic derivatives. This unusual multifunctional oxygenase may inspire future biocatalytic applications.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bound Inward&#8208;Growth of Artificial Cytoskeletons and Their Selective Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth strategy is presented to construct membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs) consisting of convergent&#8208;arranged nanofibers grown from a capsule membrane. Furthermore, this method enables the light&#8208;controlled integration of dynamic covalent bonds into the MAC and to realize two modes of selective disassembly behaviors.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is one of the most important cellular components. Up to now, most of the reported artificial cytoskeletons are based on a gel&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle strategy. Herein, we report a membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth pathway to prepare cytoskeleton&#8208;like and radially aligned nanofibers grown from capsule membranes to get membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs). The mechanism therein is disclosed through the direct observation of the intermediates in both dried and liquid states. Furthermore, the as&#8208;prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work provides a new hierarchical self&#8208;assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.

         <title>Bonding in a Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Not &#963;&#8208;Aromatic But Still Unique</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High symmetry and unusual thermodynamic stability of the recently prepared and isolated crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster is determined by the unique multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding pattern (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic Th3 bonding. The delocalized (ThCl2)3 bond extends the range of the charge&#8208;shift bonding beyond transition metals to a record seventh row of the periodic table.







Abstract
Very recently, Boronski et&#8197;al. reported the first thorium&#8211;thorium bond in a crystalline cluster prepared under normal experimental conditions. By using a range of experimental techniques and computational models, the authors found that the isolated actinide cluster contains at its heart two paired electrons delocalized over the tri&#8208;thorium ring. The recorded Raman spectrum allegedly confirmed the existence of a &#963;&#8208;aromatic three&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bond. In the following we demonstrate that the experimentally observed broad inelastic scattering bands between 60 and 135&#8197;cm&#8722;1, originally assigned by the authors to thorium&#8208;thorium vibrations, represent the combination of Th&#8722;Cl stretching and Th&#8722;Cl&#8722;Th bending modes, and they establish the existence of an unprecedented multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding (ThCl2)3 rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic bonding Th3. In the light of the presented findings, the latter remains experimentally unproven and computationally questionable.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Evolution of G Protein&#8208;Biased &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
cryoEM structures of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) bound to the lead compound PZM21 and the newly developed agonist FH210 were obtained to understand the mechanism of their biased signaling and to guide the evolution of next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.







Abstract
The &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) is the major target for opioid analgesics. Activation of &#956;OR initiates signaling through G protein pathways as well as through &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment. &#956;OR agonists that are biased towards G protein signaling pathways demonstrate diminished side effects. PZM21, discovered by computational docking, is a G protein biased &#956;OR agonist. Here we report the cryoEM structure of PZM21 bound &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein. Structure&#8208;based evolution led to multiple PZM21 analogs with more pronounced Gi protein bias and increased lipophilicity to improve CNS penetration. Among them, FH210 shows extremely low potency and efficacy for arrestin recruitment. We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.

We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;-arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next-generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allenyl Alcohols by Cobalt(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential C&#8722;H Bond Addition to 1,3&#8208;Enynes and Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and stereoselective Co&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component synthesis of allenyl alcohols is reported. This method introduces two C&#8722;C &#963; bonds through C&#8722;H bond activation and sequential addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a wide range of aldehydes. A plausible mechanism and further transformations are disclosed.







Abstract
An efficient and stereoselective CoIII&#8208;catalyzed sequential C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes and aldehydes is disclosed. This transformation represents the first example of sequential C&#8722;H bond additions to 1,3&#8208;enynes and a second coupling partner and provides the first example of preparing allenes by C&#8722;H bond addition to 1,3&#8208;enynes. A wide range of aldehydes, C&#8722;H bond substrates and 1,3&#8208;enynes with large substituents on the alkynes are effective substrates. The allenyl alcohol products can be further converted to dihydrofurans with high stereoselectivity either in situ or under Ag&#8208;mediated cyclization conditions. The allenyl silyl group can also be transferred to the adjacent alcohol by a Brook rearrangement. Moreover, a mechanism for the transformation is proposed supported by X&#8208;ray structural characterization of a cobaltacycle intermediate.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Reversible, and Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors That Selectively Target the Catalytic Lysine of BCR&#8208;ABL Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine is reported. Amongst lead compounds, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent nanomolar inhibition against endogenous ABL kinase, with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets.







Abstract
Despite recent interests in developing lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, no general approach is available to create such compounds. We report herein a general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine residue using key SuFEx and salicylaldehyde&#8208;based imine chemistries. We validated the strategy by successfully developing (irreversible and reversible) covalent inhibitors against BCR&#8208;ABL kinase. Our lead compounds showed high levels of selectivity in biochemical assays, exhibited nanomolar potency against endogenous ABL kinase in cellular assays, and were active against most drug&#8208;resistant ABL mutations. Among them, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent ABL inhibition with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets in K562 cells. Bioinformatics further suggested the generality of our strategy against the human kinome.

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;: Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) was made photoswitchable following an &#8220;azo&#8208;extension&#8221; approach on the indole moiety. A library of azo&#8208;DMTs was synthesized out of which 5&#8208;(4&#8208;MeO)&#8208;azo&#8208;DMT (Photo&#8208;DMT) acted as cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221;.







Abstract
Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor (5&#8208;HT2AR) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated by visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound 2&#8201;h (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its cis isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the trans isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT2AR signaling.

         <title>Strain of Supramolecular Interactions in Single&#8208;Stacking Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strains of supramolecular interaction were explored, and revealed an odd&#8211;even effect in a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions, offering new insights into the supramolecular interaction from the molecular level.







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics provide opportunities to integrate molecular building blocks into electronic circuits, and investigations of the mechanical properties of the non&#8208;covalent interactions are necessary to understand the role of the assembly configuration in the electronic coupling among different assembly blocks. However, the mechanical characterization of supramolecular interactions remains experimentally challenging. We investigated the strain distribution of the supramolecular interactions through a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions. The alpha values exhibit a clear odd&#8208;even effect versus the numbers of thiophene rings. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that a larger rotational barrier of the single&#8208;stacking junctions with an even number of thiophene rings leads to limited torsional freedom and thus a smaller strain distribution. These results provide new insights into the control of supramolecular interactions by the design of the basic molecular building blocks.

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection Using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various signal transduction strategies that are employed in chemical and biological sensing with DNA&#8208;based nanostructures are the focus of this Minireview. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these different methods are also discussed and the considerations that determine the ideal strategy for a given application are delineated.







Abstract
The use of DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes has led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA's inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.

In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA-based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>anti&#8208;Selective Borylstannylation of Alkynes with (o&#8208;Phenylenediaminato)borylstannanes by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have achieved the first  anti  &#8208;borylstannylation of alkynes by using (  o  &#8208;phenylenediaminato)borylstannanes. This reaction afforded 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;stannylalkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by a radical mechanism. This  anti  &#8208;addition manner is in sharp contrast to the  syn  &#8208;selectivity obtained during transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylstannylation. The mild radical conditions enabled a broad substrate scope, and various types of aromatic and aliphatic alkynes were applicable. The origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity was elucidated by DFT calculation of the reaction mechanism. The application of the borylstannylation products to cross&#8208; or homocoupling reactions provided ready access to either triarylethenes or bisborylbutadienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Epoxidation and Acidic Epoxide Opening of Antibacterial and Antiplasmodial Chlorotonils Yield Highly Potent Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a severe threat to public health. The natural product chlorotonil was identified as a new antibiotic targeting multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens and Plasmodium falciparum. Although chlorotonil shows promising activities, the scaffold is highly lipophilic and displays potential biological instabilities. Therefore, we strived towards improving its pharmaceutical properties by semisynthesis. We demonstrated stereoselective epoxidation of chlorotonils and epoxide ring opening in moderate to good yields providing derivatives with significantly enhanced solubility. Furthermore, in vivo stability of the derivatives was improved while retaining their nanomolar activity against critical human pathogens (e.g. methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and P. falciparum). Intriguingly, we showed further superb activity for the frontrunner molecule in a mouse model of S. aureus infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Natural Products by a Pharmacophore&#8208;Oriented Semisynthesis Approach for the Discovery of Potential Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products possessing unique scaffolds may have antiviral activity but their complex structures hinder facile synthesis. A pharmacophore&#8208;oriented semisynthesis approach was applied to (&#8211;)&#8208;maoelactone A (  1  ) and oridonin (  2  ) for the discovery of anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 agents. The Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction was developed to construct the unprecedented maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold during semisynthesis of  1  . Further mechanistic study suggested a concerted mechanism for Wolff rearrangement and a water&#8208;assisted stepwise process for lactonization. The WRLC reaction then enabled the creation of a novel family by assembly of the maoelactone&#8208;type scaffold and the pharmacophore of  2  , whereby one derivative inhibited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication in HPA EpiC cells with a low EC50  value (19 &#177; 1 nM) and a high TI value (&gt;1000), both values better than those of remdesivir.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bonded p&#8208;type semiconducting ribbons have been engineered through the self&#8208;assembly of tailored &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. Theoretical studies of the electronic states showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. Implementation of the ribbons as hole&#8208;transport layers in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells gave rise to devices with performances similar to those obtained with state&#8208;of&#8208;art semiconductors.







Abstract
This work describes the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated telluro[3,2&#8208;&#946;][1]&#8208;tellurophene&#8208;based synthon that, embodying pyridyl and haloaryl chalcogen&#8208;bonding acceptors, self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons through chalcogen bonds. The ribbons &#960;&#8208;stack in a multi&#8208;layered architecture both in single crystals and thin films. Theoretical studies of the electronic states of chalcogen&#8208;bonded material showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. OTFT&#8208;based charge transport measurements showed hole&#8208;transport properties for this material. Its integration as a p&#8208;type semiconductor in multi&#8208;layered CuI&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) led to a 10&#8208;fold increase in stability (38&#8197;h vs. 3&#8197;h) compared to single&#8208;layered devices. Finally, using the reference tellurotellurophene congener bearing a C&#8722;H group instead of the pyridyl N atom, a herringbone solid&#8208;state assembly is formed without charge transport features, resulting in LECs with poor stabilities (&lt;1&#8197;h).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI complexes with different ligands (CH3CN, oDFB, NEt3) and counterions of varying coordination ability (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722;) catalyze the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. Detailed mechanistic research shows that this reaction follows a mononuclear pathway, in contrast to the dinuclear mechanism of the enzyme tyrosinase.







Abstract
The CuI salts [Cu(CH3CN)4]PF and [Cu(oDFB)2]PF with the very weakly coordinating anion Al(OC(CF3)3)4&#8722; (PF) as well as [Cu(NEt3)2]PF comprising the unique, linear bis&#8208;triethylamine complex [Cu(NEt3)2]+ were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. The activities of these CuI salts towards monooxygenation of 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions (BF4&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, PF6&#8722;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. The reaction is drastically accelerated by employing CuII&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a CuII complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This result and other experimental observations show that with these systems the oxygenation of monophenols does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.

&lt;p&gt;Homoleptic Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with different ligands (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;DFB, NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and counterions of varying coordination ability (BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) catalyze the conversion of monophenols to &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-quinones. Detailed mechanistic research shows that this reaction follows a mononuclear pathway, in contrast to the dinuclear mechanism of the enzyme tyrosinase.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; salts [Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;PF&lt;/b&gt; and [Cu(oDFB)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;PF&lt;/b&gt; with the very weakly coordinating anion Al(OC(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;PF&lt;/b&gt;) as well as [Cu(NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;PF&lt;/b&gt; comprising the unique, linear bis-triethylamine complex [Cu(NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-quinones. The activities of these Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; salts towards monooxygenation of 2,4-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylphenol (DTBP-H) were compared to those of [Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions (BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, OTf&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), revealing an &lt;i&gt;anion effect&lt;/i&gt; on the activity of the catalyst and a &lt;i&gt;ligand effect&lt;/i&gt; on the reaction rate. The reaction is drastically accelerated by employing Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This result and other experimental observations show that with these systems the oxygenation of monophenols does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Palladium/Isothiourea Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloaddition of Vinylcyclopropanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis allows the formal (3+2) cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters to generate functionalized cyclopentanes via an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediate with the addition of LiCl crucial to obtain high product diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A protocol for the enantioselective synthesis of substituted vinylcyclopentanes has been realised using cooperative palladium and isothiourea catalysis. Treatment of vinylcyclopropanes with Pd(PPh3)4 generates a zwitterionic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate that intercepts a catalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium species prepared from the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated para&#8208;nitrophenyl ester and the isothiourea (R)&#8208;BTM. Intermolecular formal (3+2) cycloaddition between these reactive intermediates generates functionalised cyclopentanes in generally good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (up to &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 dr, 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 er), with the use of LiCl as an additive proving essential for optimal stereocontrol. To the best of our knowledge a dual transition metal/organocatalytic process involving &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates has not been demonstrated previously.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of peri&#8208;Heptacene on a Metallic Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful on&#8208;surface synthesis of pristine peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA) reveals, after thermal activation of a 4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrakis(3&#8208;methylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrene precursor on a Au(111) via surface&#8208;assisted oxidative ring&#8208;closure and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling of 49&#8197;meV.







Abstract
The synthesis of long n&#8208;peri&#8208;acenes (n&#8208;PAs) is challenging as a result of their inherent open&#8208;shell radical character, which arises from the presence of parallel zigzag edges beyond a certain n value. They are considered as &#960;&#8208;electron model systems to study magnetism in graphene nanostructures; being potential candidates in the fabrication of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface formation of the largest pristine member of the n&#8208;PA family, i.e. peri&#8208;heptacene (n=7, 7&#8208;PA), obtained on an Au(111) substrate under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Our high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy investigations, complemented by theoretical simulations, provide insight into the chemical structure of this previously elusive compound. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state of 7&#8208;PA, exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (Jeff) of 49&#8197;meV.

         <title>Solution&#8208;processed AIEgen NIR OLEDs with EQE Approaching 15&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acceptor core, obtained by fusing dithiafulvalene with benzothiadiazole, was utilized to construct near&#8208;infrared AIEgen luminophores, in which TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm in the solid state and featured a high quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. The doped and non&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 14.3&#8201;% and 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 750 and 804&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens have attracted intensive attention considering their vast potential applications in areas like bioimaging, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and night&#8208;vision telecommunication. However, organic NIR luminogens with high solid quantum efficiencies are scarce, limiting their applications. Here, we reported an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, BSM, based on dithiafulvalene and benzothiadiazole, which could work as a strong acceptor to produce highly efficient NIR emitters with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. One of the AIEgens, TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm with a solid quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. When applied to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs, an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.4&#8201;% was achieved with a peak wavelength at 728&#8197;nm. Moreover, its non&#8208;doped device could achieve an extraordinary EQE of 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 804&#8197;nm. In the further optimized configuration, when an extra sensitizer was added to harvest triplet excitons, the EQE unprecedentedly soared up to 14.3&#8201;% with a peak wavelength of 750&#8197;nm.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational energy transfer in proteins has been related to enzyme catalysis, energy dissipation and allosteric communication. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200648), Jens Bredenbeck and co&#8208;workers establish a broad palette of vibrational energy sensors. A variety of functionalities covers chemical and sterical diversity. Their comparable responsivity allows to choose a suitable non&#8208;canonical amino acid for each site, as exemplified for a showcase of an allosteric protein.

         <title>Expeditious Access to Morphinans by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benchmark chemical synthesis of codeine creates an opportunity to diversify essential opiate&#8208;medicine supply chains. The brevity of this approach derives from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot, while a subsequent photo&#8208;redox hydroamination protocol is deployed to provide a novel, atom&#8208;economical means for assembling the morphinan piperidine D&#8208;ring.







Abstract
Morphinans are essential medicines derived entirely from poppy supply chains rendered increasingly volatile by climate change. Here, we report a seven&#8208;step, asymmetric chemical synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine from simple materials that requires a total combined reaction time of fewer than 24&#8197;hours. The efficiency of our approach arises from a double&#8208;Heck cyclization reaction that generates two rings and two contiguous stereogenic carbon centres in the one pot. A subsequent photo&#8208;redox hydroamination protocol provides a novel, atom&#8208;economical means for assembling the piperidine D&#8208;ring of codeine. Simple modifications to the closing stages of our sequence offer effective access to pharmacologically valuable derivatives of N&#8208;demethyl codeine. Our work highlights the capacity for contemporary, stand&#8208;alone chemical synthesis regimes to diversify access to essential opiate medicines.

         <title>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase by Electrolyte Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is successfully constructed on LiCoO2 cathode by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at 1.7&#8197;V. LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration and Co dissolution during cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, demonstrating an excellent cyclability with high capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5C.







Abstract
The capacity of transition metal oxide cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries can be further enhanced by increasing the charging potential. However, these high voltage cathodes suffer from fast capacity decay because the large volume change of cathode breaks the active materials and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), resulting in electrolyte penetration into broken active materials and continuous side reactions between cathode and electrolytes. Herein, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI was formed by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at a low potential of 1.7&#8197;V. By taking LiCoO2 as a model cathode, we demonstrate that the LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration at a high cut&#8208;off potential of 4.6&#8197;V. The LiCoO2 with LiF&#8208;rich CEI exhibited a capacity of 198&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C and an enhanced capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles as compared to the LiF&#8208;free LiCoO2 with only 17.4&#8201;% of capacity retention.

         <title>Strong and Reversible Covalent Double Network Hydrogel Based on Force&#8208;Coupled Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction was used to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to create a reversible bond and engineer double network (DN) hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery. The peptide ligase, sortase A (SrtA), can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force and re&#8208;ligation of peptides without force, allowing the sacrificial network in DN hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly.







Abstract
Biological load&#8208;bearing tissues are strong, tough, and recoverable under periodic mechanical loads. However, such features have rarely been achieved simultaneously in the same synthetic hydrogels. Here, we use a force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to a reversible bond. Based on this concept we engineered double network hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery in the same hydrogels. Specifically, we found that a peptide ligase, sortase A, can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force. The peptide bond can be re&#8208;ligated by the same enzyme in the absence of force. This allows the sacrificial network in the double&#8208;network hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly. Our results demonstrate a general approach for precisely controlling the mechanical and dynamic properties of hydrogels at the molecular level.

         <title>Traceless Benzylic C&#8211;H Amination via Bifunctional N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8211;H amination methods, however, is currently limited by typical requirement that the amine precursors bear activating groups, such as  N  &#8208;sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8211;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8211;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse  N  &#8208;functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8211;H  N  &#8208;aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8211;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8211;H amination, deaminative N&#8211;N functionalization sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Reaction Routes in Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Conversion of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenolysis and hydrolysis of aryl ethers in the liquid phase are important reactions for accessing functionalized cyclic compounds from renewable feedstocks. On supported noble metals, hydrogenolysis is initiated by a hydrogen addition to the aromatic ring followed by C&#8211;O bond cleavage. In water, hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis proceed by partial hydrogenation of the aromatic ring prior to water or hydrogen insertion. The mechanisms are common for the studied metals, but the selectivity to hydrogenolysis increases in the order Pd &lt; Rh &lt; Ir &lt; Ru &#8776; Pt in decalin and water; the inverse was observed for the selectivity to hydrolysis in water. Hydrogenolysis selectivity correlates with the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. Hydrogenolysis has the highest standard free energy of activation and a weak dependence on H  2  pressure, thus, the selectivity to hydrogenolysis is maximized by increasing temperature and decreasing H  2  pressure. Selectivity to C&#8211;O bond cleavage reaches &gt;95% in water and alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Actuation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers at or Below Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subject to a stimulus. The large stimuli&#8208;response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce a materials chemistry to prepare LCE via thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8208;ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3&#8208;D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5%&#730;C  &#8208;1  . The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi&#8208;material element.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subject to a stimulus. The large stimuli-response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce a materials chemistry to prepare LCE via thiol-Michael/thiol-ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3-D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5%&#730;C  -1  . The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi-material element.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;vivo production of diverse &#946;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The wide range of moieties installed in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) suggests largely untapped potential for protein engineering. However, many RiPP maturases recognize target peptide precursors through an N&#8208;terminal leader sequence that is challenging to adapt to proteins. We have recently reported a family of enzymes that splice XYG sites in RiPPs to install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Backbone modifications influence diverse protein properties, yet the toolkit to install &#946;&#8208;amino acids is limited. Here we report their leader&#8208;independent incorporation into proteins in  E. coli  . Integrating an 11&#8208;residue splice tag into six different proteins permitted the site&#8208;selective introduction of &#946;&#8208;residues  in vivo  . The motif fusion at C&#8208;, N&#8208;terminal, and internal positions yielded various &#946;&#8208;residues. Our approach complements the few existing methods to introduce &#946;&#8208;amino acids or ketone&#8208;bearing moieties, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridylic C&#8211;H Functionalization by Photocatalytic Radical Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An  efficient  pyridylic C(sp  3  )  &#8211;H functionalization has been developed through photocatalytic radical&#8208;mediated  fluoroalkylation  or cascade reactions. This method is enabled by the reversible formation of alkylidene dihydropyridine intermediates via the facile enolate formation of C4&#8208;alkyl  N  &#8208;amidopyridinium salts in the absence of an external base, thereby establishing the conditions necessary for subsequent intermolecular radical trapping. Rapid structural diversification of the pyridylic site can be achieved through photocatalytic multicomponent cascade reactions involving alkene trifluoromethylation, SO  2  &#8208;reincorporation, and sulfonyl radical addition. This operationally simple method features a broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity and offers a unique approach for the rational modification of the heterobenzylic C&#8211;H bonds of pyridines and quinolines with uniform site&#8208;selective control. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;order Conversion&#8208;induced Enhancement of Thermal Stability of Pyroxene NIR Phosphors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The minimization of thermal quenching, which leads to luminescence loss at high temperatures, is one of the most important research topics for near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting phosphors. In the present work, the properties of near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al, Si)O  6  :Cr  3+  phosphor with a pyroxene&#8208;type structure under blue light excitation were investigated. The CaScAlSiO  6  :Cr  3+  end member of Ca(Sc,Mg)(Al,Si)O  6  :Cr  3+  phosphor led to broadband emission at a full&#8208;width half maximum of 215 nm, whereas the CaMgSi  2  O  6  :Cr  3+  end member exhibited high thermal stability at 150&#176;C with an intensity of 88.4% of that at room temperature. The structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the absence of soft conformations and local space confinement contributed to high structural rigidity and weakened the thermal quenching effect. Moreover, NIR&#8208;LEDs were fabricated using the investigated pyroxene phosphors to demonstrate the potential applications of NIR light for cracks and flaws detection inside structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Breakthroughs in P4 Chemistry: Towards Practical, Direct Transformations into P1 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For several decades, academic researchers have been intensively studying the chemistry of white phosphorus (P  4  ) in the hope of developing direct methods for its transformation into useful P&#8208;containing products. This would bypass the hazardous, multistep procedures currently relied on by industry. However, while academically interesting P  4  activation reactions have become well established, their elaboration into useful, general synthetic procedures has remained out of reach. Very recently, however, a series of independent reports has begun to change this state of affairs. Each shows how relatively simple and practical synthetic methods can be used to access academically or industrially relevant P  1  compounds from P  4  directly, in &#8216;one pot&#8217; or even in a catalytic fashion. These reports mark a step change in the field of P  4  chemistry, and suggest its possible transition from an area of largely academic interest to one with the promise of true synthetic relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Turn&#8208;on Fluorescence Mechanism of a Fluorescein&#8208;Based Probe in GABAA Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>GABAA (&#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid type A) receptors are ligand&#8208;gated ion channels mediating fast inhibitory transmission in the mammalian brain. Here we report the molecular and electronic mechanism governing the turn&#8208;on emission of a fluorescein&#8208;based imaging probe able to target the human GABAA receptor. Multiscale calculations evidence a drastic conformational change of the probe from folded in solution to extended upon binding to the receptor. Intramolecular &#960;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions present in the folded probe are responsible for quenching fluorescence in solution. In contrast, unfolding within the GABAA receptor changes the nature of the bright excited state triggering emission. Remarkably, this turn&#8208;on effect only manifests for the dianionic prototropic form of the imaging probe, which is found to be the strongest binder to the GABAA receptor. This study is expected to assist the design of new photoactivatable screening tools for allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABAA (&#947;-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels mediating fast inhibitory transmission in the mammalian brain. Here we report the molecular and electronic mechanism governing the turn-on emission of a fluorescein-based imaging probe able to target the human GABAA receptor. Multiscale calculations evidence a drastic conformational change of the probe from folded in solution to extended upon binding to the receptor.

         <title>Unimolecular Nanoparticles toward more Precise Regulations of Self&#8208;assembled Superlattices in Soft Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process opens up a great potential for the construction of nanostructural superlattices. Precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices, however, remains a challenge. Even the primary molecules are precise, the supramolecular motifs (or secondary building blocks) can vary dramatically. In the present work, we propose the concept of unimolecular nanoparticles (UMNPs). It acts as the supramolecular motif and directly packs into the superlattices. A highly branched giant molecule is presented. We systematically explore its conformations and superlattice of this giant molecule. Moreover, intriguing complex phases are discovered when blending this UMNP with other conventional giant molecules. These binary mixtures provide direct evidence to support our previously proposed self&#8208;sorting process in the self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;. The concept of UMNPs offers a unique approach toward more precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled superlattices in soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Templated &#947;&#8208;Keggin Alkyltin&#8208;Oxo Cluster: Electronic Structure and Optical Limiting Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most representative polyoxometalate (POM) structures, Keggin clusters have attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;templated Keggin structure has not been reported to date. In this work, for the first time, Ag atom was successfully incorporated to template the formation of &#947;&#8208;Keggin alkytin&#8208;oxo cluster. Moreover, the central Ag atom has brought significant heavy atom effect, showing important influence on the electronic structure and optical property. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Ag atom affects the frontier molecular orbitals and excited states of the  AgSn12  cluster, and also the process of electron transfer. The solid structure of the  AgSn12  cluster exhibits significant third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and excellent optical limiting effect has been experimentally verified. The success of this work opens a way for the construction and optical properties modulation of noble metal templated Keggin structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Pyrenophanes: Intense Circularly Polarized&#160;Luminescence Based on a D2 Symmetry Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of  D  2  &#8208;symmetric macrocycles composed of alternately linked pyrene and binaphthyl moieties (binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes) have been synthesized. Among them, a pyrenophane possessing ether linkers at the 2,7&#8208;positions of the pyrenes exhibited intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a |  g  lum  | value of 0.053. This value is by far the highest for excimers and was not sensitive to temperature, solvent, or concentration. The CPL originated from a twisting pyrene excimer, with the (  R  )&#8208;binaphthyl moieties producing a left&#8208;handed twist excimer, which exhibited (&#8211;)&#8208;CPL. The electric and magnetic transition dipole moments are perfectly parallel, which is the best relationship for strong CPL.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Synthesis of 2&#8208;Benzazepine Derivatives via Tunable Cyclization and 1,4&#8208;Acyl Transfer Triggered by Amide N&#8208;C Bond Cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings was developed for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the formation of 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;directed divergent synthesis can transform common starting materials into distinct molecular scaffolds by simple tuning different ligands. This strategy enables the rapid construction of structurally rich collection of small molecules for biological evaluation and reveals novel modes of catalytic transformation, representing one of the most sought&#8208;after challenges in synthetic chemistry. We herein report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;controlled tunable cyclization/cross&#8208;couplings for the divergent synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;benzazepine frameworks. The bidentate ligand facilitates the nucleophilic addition of the aryl halides to the amide carbonyl, followed by 1,4&#8208;acyl transfer and cross&#8208;coupling to obtain 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;5&#8208;ones and benzo[c]pyrano[2,3&#8208;e]azepines. The tridentate ligand promotes the selective 7&#8208;endo cyclization/cross&#8208;coupling to access to 2&#8208;benzazepin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The protocol operates under mild reaction conditions with divergent cyclization patterns that can be easily modulated through the ligand backbone.

         <title>Intrinsic Nonflammable Ether Electrolytes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Chlorine Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte of LiFSI/1.6Cl&#8208;DEE/3TTE with chlorinated&#8208;DEE as the base solvent has excellent flame&#8208;retarding properties, intrinsic anti&#8208;oxidation capabilities and forms interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, which improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages.







Abstract
The issues of inherent low anodic stability and high flammability hinder the deployment of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes in practical high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. Here, we report a rationally designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte with chlorine functionality on ether molecular structure to address these critical challenges. The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates a high Li Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% and a high capacity retention &gt;88&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes at an ultrahigh cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (stable even up to 4.7&#8197;V). The chloroether&#8208;based electrolyte not only greatly improves electrochemical stabilities of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes under ultrahigh voltages with interphases riched in LiF and LiCl, but possesses the intrinsic nonflammable safety feature owing to the flame&#8208;retarding ability of chlorine functional groups. This study offers a new approach to enable ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high energy density, long&#8208;life and safe Li metal batteries.

         <dc:description>
An inorganic&#8208;hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) was fabricated by the introduction of initiator into a mechanically robust sol&#8208;gel layer for surface initiated polymerization. This strategy enables polymerization repeatedly when polymer brushes on the surface were worn off and both PIC and surface grafted brushes show excellent anti&#8208;abrasive property compared to conventional brushes.







Abstract
In this study, a novel surface initiated polymerization (SIP) method was developed from organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) that embeds initiator molecules into inorganic silica sol&#8208;gel layer. Comparing with traditional silane initiator surface that prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the PIC can effectively improve the mechanical stability of initiator that was able to endure ten&#8208;thousand times of friction cycles. Besides, it allows polymer grafting from sub&#8208;surface and so the grafted brushes, poly 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (pSPMA) on the PIC were also much more wear&#8208;resisting than those prepared by the traditional ways. More importantly, the PIC could still trigger new polymerization reaction when the grafted brushes were worn off. In addition, the PIC is universal and can be covered on different substrates including glass, metals and plastics, etc. to realize functionalization of these materials. The approach may pave technological way for the application of surface grafted polymer brushes.

         <title>Diastereoselective Transfer of Tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes&#8208;Derived Carbenes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cis&#8208;selective cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropanol derivatives. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as the key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.







Abstract
Stereoselective cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet&#8208;metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. However, previous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes with acylsilanes afforded low diastereoselectivity. Herein, we report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with trifluoroacetylsilanes and difluoroacetylsilanes. Both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are suitable substrates for the highly cis&#8208;selective [2+1] cyclization reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as being key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.

         <title>Alteration of the Catalytic Reaction Trajectory of a Vicinal Oxygen Chelate Enzyme by Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of ChaP, a novel vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme, afforded bifunctional enzymes designated as &#8220;ChaP variants&#8221;, which catalyzed regioselective intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylation of the ring&#8208;opened molecules. This activity expands the VOC catalytic repertoire to bring us closer to artificial VOC enzymes of broad biotechnological significance.







Abstract
The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily catalyzes a highly diverse set of reactions with the mechanism characterized by the bidentate coordination of vicinal oxygen atoms to metal ion centers, but there remains a lack of a platform to steer the reaction trajectories, especially for o&#8208;quinone metabolizing pathways. Herein, we present the directed&#8208;evolution&#8208;enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and concomitant &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone deconstruction and CO2 liberation from the resulting o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity. Enzyme crystal structures, labeling experiments and computational simulations corroborated that the D49L mutation allows the metal ion to change its coordination with the tyrosine phenoxy atoms in different monomers, thereby altering the reaction trajectory with the regiospecificity further improved by the follow&#8208;up replacement of the Y92 residue with any of alanine, glycine, threonine, and serine. The study highlights the unpredicted catalytic versatility and enzymatic plasticity of VOC enzymes with biotechnological significance.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer Driven Enantioselective Minisci Reaction of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective Minisci reaction between pyridines and prochiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals has been developed. Hydrogen atom transfer is used to generate the latter from simple alcohols and the reaction formally constitutes the couple of two C&#8722;H bonds to form a new C&#8722;C bond in a process that is highly enantioselective and regioselective. Computational studies provide insight into the origins of selectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective Minisci reactions have recently been developed but all instances so far utilize &#945;&#8208;amino radical coupling partners. We report a substantial evolution of the enantioselective Minisci reaction that enables &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals to be used, providing valuable enantioenriched secondary alcohol products. This is achieved through the direct oxidative coupling of two C&#8722;H bonds on simple alcohol and pyridine partners through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;driven approach: a challenging process to achieve due to the numerous side reactions that can occur. Our approach is highly regioselective as well as highly enantioselective. Dicumyl peroxide, upon irradiation with 390&#8197;nm light, serves as both HAT reagent and oxidant whilst selectivity is controlled by use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. Computational and experimental evidence provide mechanistic insight as to the origin of selectivity, revealing a stereodetermining deprotonation step distinct from the analogous reaction of amide&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Spatially Selective Monitoring of Subcellular Enzyme Dynamics in Response to Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform was constructed for in situ imaging of the subcellular enzyme dynamics in response to near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). With this versatile nanodevice, mitochondrial accumulation of specific enzymes was visualized in response to the increased concentration of reactive oxygen species during PDT.







Abstract
Tracking spatial and temporal dynamics of bioactive molecules such as enzymes responding to therapeutic treatment is highly important for understanding of the related functions. However, in situ molecular imaging at subcellular level during photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been hampered by the limitations of existing methods. Herein, we present a multifunctional nanoplatform (termed as UR&#8208;HAPT) that is able to simultaneously monitor subcellular dynamics of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) during the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated PDT. UR&#8208;HAPT was constructed by the combination of an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based PDT design and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy with an APE1&#8208;responsive DNA reporter. Benefiting from the gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach, activatable mitochondrial accumulation of APE1 in response to the oxidative stress was observed during the NIR light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT process. We envision that this nanoplatform can be applicable to screen and evaluate potential enzyme inhibitors to improve the PDT efficacy.

Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.

         <title>Computational Identification and Experimental Demonstration of High&#8208;Performance Methane Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising MOFs were identified computationally and experimentally demonstrate remarkable methane uptake that outperforms known benchmarks both volumetrically and gravimetrically. Advanced set of interatomic potentials that explicitly accounts for the presence of coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) in MOFs were used to identify the high&#8208;capacity MOFs that were previously overlooked due to the limitation of the general interatomic potentials.







Abstract
Remarkable methane uptake is demonstrated experimentally in three metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) identified by computational screening: UTSA&#8208;76, UMCM&#8208;152 and DUT&#8208;23&#8208;Cu. These MOFs outperform the benchmark sorbent, HKUST&#8208;1, both volumetrically and gravimetrically, under a pressure swing of 80 to 5&#8197;bar at 298&#8197;K. Although high uptake at elevated pressure is critical for achieving this performance, a low density of high&#8208;affinity sites (coordinatively unsaturated metal centers) also contributes to a more complete release of stored gas at low pressure. The identification of these MOFs facilitates the efficient storage of natural gas via adsorption and provides further evidence of the utility of computational screening in identifying overlooked sorbents.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes in Water: Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Stereoregular Telechelic Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of phenylacetylenes in water was achieved by the development of a water&#8208;soluble rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system. The obtained water&#8208;soluble polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The present polymerization method enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends and the synthesis of novel block copolymers in water.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of water&#8208;soluble phenylacetylene derivatives in water was achieved for the first time using a multicomponent catalytic system consisting of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, an aryl boronic acid, diphenylacetylene having carboxy groups, a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and a water&#8208;soluble triphenylphosphine. This catalytic system enables a direct synthesis of various water&#8208;soluble cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s having a narrow molecular weight distribution, the molecular weight of which can be controlled by the initial feed ratio of the monomer to the catalyst. Moreover, the syntheses of water&#8208;soluble telechelic poly(phenylacetylene)s having various functional groups at both chain ends as well as a water&#8208;soluble block copolymer were achieved.

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Couples from Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient recycling of catalyst&#8208;solvent couples was showcased in enantioselective Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions that were run in highly Lewis basic environments in which there is a greater risk of metal leaching. The success is attributed to a bioinspired approach to heterogenize microhydrated chiral Lewis acids within appropriate hydrophobic cavities, thereby decreasing catalyst deactivation and suppressing metal leaching.







Abstract
Bioinspired supramolecular architectures were used to compartmentalize highly charged aqua scandium ions into chiral hydrophobic scaffolds for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions. Recycling without significant loss in catalytic performance is a formidable task, especially for Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. This is because Lewis basic impurities derived from starting materials, products, and water are highly competitive ligands for both substrate binding and metal complexation, thus poisoning the Lewis acids and leading to their leaching. Even when basic aniline is used, the architecture allowed for effective suppression of Sc3+ leaching and for reuse of solvent&#8208;catalyst couples in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions without deactivation. Application to asymmetric thia&#8208;Michael addition and hydroxymethylation was also demonstrated. The successful recycling in highly Lewis basic environments underpins the exceptionally high robustness of the chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

         <title>(Hetero)aryl&#8208;SVI Fluorides: Synthetic Development and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit the synthesis of (hetero)arylsulfur(VI) fluorides is steadily growing due to their potential in organic synthesis. This Minireview covers the synthesis of arylsulfur(VI) fluorides from levels 2 to 5 of fluorination, the substrate scope, mechanisms, and the further applicability of these fluorinated compounds.







Abstract
(Hetero)arylsulfur compounds where the S atom is in the oxidation state VI represent a large percentage of the molecular functionalities present in organic chemistry. More specifically, (hetero)aryl&#8208;SVI fluorides have recently received enormous attention because of their potential as chemical biology probes, as a result of their reactivity in a simple, modular, and efficient manner. Whereas the synthesis and application of the level&#8197;1 fluorination at SVI atoms (sulfonyl and sulfonimidoyl fluorides) have been widely studied and reviewed, the synthetic strategies towards higher levels of fluorination (levels&#8197;2 to 5) are somewhat more limited. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in the synthesis of highly fluorinated aryl&#8208;SVI compounds at all levels, discussing synthetic strategies, reactivity, the advantages and disadvantages of the synthetic procedures, the proposed mechanisms, and the potential upcoming opportunities.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Management for High&#8208;Temperature Mesoporous SnO2 Electron Transport Layers in Printable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies (OVs) were managed by the lattice Mg and the interstitial Mg which modulated the formation and ionization of OVs for self&#8208;doping in SnO2. OV management optimized the capability of high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 to serve as well&#8208;performed ETLs for printable PSCs with efficiency enhanced from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 ETL (mp&#8208;SnO2) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp&#8208;SnO2 for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high&#8208;temperature annealing suppresses self&#8208;doping of SnO2 by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO2 and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self&#8208;doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp&#8208;SnO2, ensuring its capability as the well&#8208;performed ETL with trap&#8208;less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planar SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high-temperature mesoporous SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ETL (mp-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high-temperature annealing suppresses self-doping of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self-doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ensuring its capability as the well-performed ETL with trap-less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols for the Synthesis of Chiral Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic allylic alcohols are converted into chiral amino acid derivatives via asymmetric hydroalkylation enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggested that a single ruthenium chiral catalyst controls the stereoselectivity of two remote chiral centers through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation and a diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Nickel Single Atoms by Confined Nickel Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst was developed. With electron donation from the Ni nanoparticle to single atoms via a carbon network, the catalyst achieves a high CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V with an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;% for electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed active sites is promising to boost catalytic activity but is challenging to achieve. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) prepared via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8722;N&#8722;C sites via a network of carbon nanotubes, achieving a high CO current density of 346&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based anode in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst delivers an industrially relevant CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;%. The superior CO2 electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on the electron&#8208;rich Ni single atoms, as well as a high density of active sites.

         <title>Sustainable Afterglow Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Materials Generated Using Natural Phenolics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable organic afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime up to 934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics has seldom been reported yet this is essential for the development of sustainable afterglow RTP materials. With this research, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to &#8776;934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. Theoretical simulations indicate that the restricted carbonyl moieties of the GA and H&#8208;type aggregates of GA in a SA matrix promoted the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and induced afterglow emission. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked networks of SA. As an illustration of potential applications, GA@SA was used to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeit afterglow clothing and paper. This work provides an innovative method for the activation of long&#8208;lived afterglow RTP from sustainable phenolics.

         <dc:description>
The first cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), have been structurally characterized and utilized as electrocatalysts. These POCs exhibit host&#8208;guest interactions with 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles and large metal&#8208;oxo clusters.







Abstract
We report on the discovery of the first two examples of cationic palladium(II)&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs) containing f&#8208;metal ions, [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=CeIV, ThIV), and their physicochemical characterization in the solid state, in solution and in the gas phase. The molecular structure of the two novel POCs comprises an octahedral {Pd6O12}12&#8722; core that is capped by eight MIV ions, resulting in a cationic, cubic assembly {Pd6O12MIV8}20+, which is coordinated by a total of 16 terminal dimethylarsinate and eight water ligands, resulting in the mixed PdII&#8208;CeIV/ThIV oxo&#8208;clusters [PdII6O12M8{(CH3)2AsO2}16(H2O)8]4+ (M=Ce, Pd6Ce8; Th, Pd6Th8). We have also studied the formation of host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes of Pd6Ce8 and Pd6Th8 with anionic 4&#8208;sulfocalix[n]arenes (n=4, 6, 8), resulting in the first examples of discrete, enthalpically&#8208;driven supramolecular assemblies between large metal&#8208;oxo clusters and calixarene&#8208;based macrocycles. The POCs were also found to be useful as pre&#8208;catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;reduction and HCOOH&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Dendrite Issues for Zinc Anodes in a Flexible Cell Configuration for Zinc&#8208;Based Wearable Energy&#8208;Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most studies and optimizations of Zn anodes for batteries are based on a planar working mode, ignoring the flexible modes needed for wearable devices. Herein, the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curved areas and the correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells are studied. Ideal cell configurations are shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with good mechanical properties and high adhesivity.







Abstract
A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes needed. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas of flexible anodes. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. The interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is shown to be hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Thus a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed that demonstrates a highly stable cell performance. This work provides a new perspective in Zn anode research for the development of FESDs.

         <title>Direct Affinity Purification of Long&#8208;Acting PASylated Proteins with Therapeutic Potential Using L&#8208;Prolinamide for Mild Elution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PASylation of pharmacologically active proteins or peptides drastically expands their hydrodynamic volume and, thus, retards renal filtration, which results in prolonged in vivo half&#8208;life. We have now developed an antibody&#8208;based affinity chromatography that permits the one&#8208;step purification of PASylated molecules in the native state using L&#8208;prolinamide as mild elution reagent.







Abstract
Both insufficient plasma half&#8208;life (circulation for only few hours or less) and laborious downstream purification can be bottleneck for biological drug development. We report a novel strategy for the efficient and gentle affinity purification of pharmacologically relevant proteins modified by PASylation for prolonged action in vivo. We previously described antibodies specific for Pro/Ala&#8208;rich sequences (PAS) covering a range of binding characteristics. Our present approach relies on a chromatography matrix functionalized with a low&#8208;affinity PAS&#8208;specific antibody Fab fragment for specific adsorption of the PASylated protein from a macromolecular mixture. With the complete absence of hydrophobic/aromatic or ionic groups in the PAS sequence epitope, binding is mediated by Van der Waals contacts and distinct hydrogen bonds only. Surprisingly, selective competitive elution is achieved by application of the highly soluble and biologically inactive imino acid derivative L&#8208;prolinamide. Based on the specific but strongly dynamic biomolecular interaction, our procedure allows the direct one&#8208;step purification of PASylated proteins from a cell extract or culture supernatant while avoiding harsh elution conditions as they are often needed for conventional affinity chromatography.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Biomarker&#8208;Regulated Photodynamic and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe is developed to turn on its near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signal for real&#8208;time imaging. Additionally, the probe can activate photodynamic therapy in response to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase in the tumor periphery and switch to photothermal therapy triggered by nitroreductase in the hypoxic tumor core.







Abstract
Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor&#8208;periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor&#8208;core&#8208;hypoxia biomarker. This PDT&#8208;PTT auto&#8208;regulated probe exhibits complete tumor ablation under the photoirradiation of a single laser source by producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen at the tumor periphery and generating hyperthermia at tumor&#8208;core where is too hypoxic for PDT. This dual&#8208;locked probe represents a promising molecular design approach toward precise cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activated, Chemiluminescent Siderophore&#8208;Dioxetane Probes Enable the Selective and Highly Sensitive Detection of Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. The conjugation of bacteria&#8208;specific, uptake&#8208;enhancing siderophore vectors with enzyme&#8208;inducible chemiluminescent dioxetanes enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum detection of &#8220;ESKAPE&#8221; pathogens. The probes displayed a high sensitivity in human plasma and also detected intracellular Gram&#8208;positive and &#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
The sensitive detection of bacterial infections is a prerequisite for their successful treatment. The use of a chemiluminescent readout was so far hampered by an insufficient probe enrichment at the pathogens. We coupled siderophore moieties, that harness the unique iron transport system of bacteria, with enzyme&#8208;activatable dioxetanes and obtained seven trifunctional probes with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios (S/B=426&#8208;859). Conjugates with efficient iron transport capability into bacteria were identified through a growth recovery assay. All ESKAPE pathogens were labelled brightly by desferrioxamine conjugates, while catechols were weaker due to self&#8208;quenching. Bacteria could also be detected inside lung epithelial cells. The best probe 8 detected 9.1&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of S. aureus and 5.0&#215;104&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 of P. aeruginosa, while the analogous fluorescent probe 10 was 205&#8211;305fold less sensitive. This qualifies siderophore dioxetane probes for the selective and sensitive detection of bacteria.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex (2) was synthesized via the reaction of an ytterbium(II) hydrido complex (1) with Me3SiN3. This unusual product represents the first example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands. DFT calculations indicated that the N2 release from Me3SiN3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers.







Abstract
The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely a hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N2 release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers.

     alt="Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity of a Hydrido- and Imido-Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hydrido- and imido-bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized via the reaction of an ytterbium(II) hydrido complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This unusual product represents the first example of a rare-earth metal complex bearing both hydrido- and imido-ligands. DFT calculations indicated that the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trivalent rare-earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare-earth metal complex bearing both hydrido- and imido-ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare-earth metal complex bearing both hydrido- and imido-ligands, namely a hydrido- and imido-bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare-earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the cooperative effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido- and imido-bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;-bond metathesis reactivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Minimizing the Reorganization Energy of Cobalt Redox Mediators Maximizes Charge Transfer Rates from Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced charge separation is at the very heart of many solar harvesting technologies. The reduction of energetic barriers to charge separation and transfer increases the rate of separation and the overall efficiency of these technologies. Here we report that internal reorganization energy&#173; of the redox acceptor, the movement of the atoms with changing charge, has a profound effect on the charge transfer rates from donor quantum dots. We experimentally studied and modelled with Marcus Theory charge transfer to cobalt complexes that have similar electrochemical potentials covering 350 mV, but vastly different reorganization energies spanning 2 eV. While the driving force does influence the electron transfer rates, the reorganization energies had a far more profound effect, increasing charge transfer rates by several orders of magnitude. Our studies suggest that careful design of redox mediators to minimize reorganization energy is an untapped route to drastically increase the efficiency of quantum dot applications that feature charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest Alignment and Defect Formation during Pore Filling in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The degree of pore filling is an important parameter for defining guest@MOF properties in applications including electronics, optics, and gas separation. However, the interplay of key aspects of host&#8208;guest interactions, such as a quantitative description of the guest alignment or the structural integrity of the host as function of pore filling are yet to be determined. Polarisation&#8208;dependent infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection configuration combined with gas sorption allowed to simultaneously study the orientation of the guest molecule and structural changes of the MOF framework during the pore filling process. Thereby we found, that initially randomly oriented guest molecules align with increasing pore filling during adsorption from the gas phase. At the same time, the framework itself undergoes a reversible, guest molecule&#8208;dependent rotation of the aromatic linker and a linker detachment process, which induce defects.</dc:description>

         <title>Trap Inlaid Cationic Hybrid Composite Material for Efficient Segregation of Toxic Chemicals from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that causes serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non&#8208;monolithic applicability has thwarted their large&#8208;scale real&#8208;time application. Herein, we strategized a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp&#8208;6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8208;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8208;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO42&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, ReO4&#8722;, CrO42&#8722;, MnO4&#8722;, in water, in the presence of 100&#8208;fold excess other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO42&#8722; even at low&#8208;concentration to well below the As(V) limit in drinking water defined by WHO.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation with Water Vapor on Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#8208;Decorated Defective Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with water is an important route to simultaneously address carbon neutrality and produce fuels. It is challenging to achieve high selectivity in CO2 methanation due to competing reactions. Nonetheless, aspects of the catalyst design can be controlled with meaningful effects on the catalytic outcomes. We report highly selective CO2 methanation with water vapor using a photocatalyst that integrates polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with single Pt atoms. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the widely explored Pt&#8722;CN catalyst is adapted for selective CO2 methanation with our rationally designed synthetic method. The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99%) for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO2 methanation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Vicinal oxygen&#8208;containing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted stereocenters exist widely in chromanone lactone and tetrahydroxanthone natural products. Their enantioselective construction in a single step remains elusive and poses a formidable challenge for chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous additions of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, which enable concise and enantioselective assembly of chromanone lactones. Both syn and anti adducts can be accessed with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity by judicious choice of the chiral ligands. Our approach allowed for the efficient synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;blennolide B with precise stereochemical control, which provides a formal synthesis of secalonic acid A.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#160;Covalent Organic Framework Packed Nanochannel Membrane for Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanochannel membrane has the prospect of large&#8208;scale separation. However, selectivity in enantioseparation is a challenge, due to the size difference between nanochannels and enantiomers. Here, we compartmented nanochannels by the  in&#8208;situ  synthesis of L&#8208;tyrosine functionalized covalent organic framework (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF). The L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF decreased the pore size of channels to match with naproxen enantiomers (S/R&#8208;NPX) and improved the enantioselective gating. In contrast to the surface&#8208;functionalized nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr channel), the L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF packed nanochannels (L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel) exhibited high enantioselectivity for S&#8208;NPX and realized the enantioseparation with the enantiomer excess value up to 94.2 %. The separation flux through the highly porous L&#8208;Tyr&#8208;COF channel was 1.33 mmolm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  . This study provided a size&#8208;matching strategy and the chiral covalent organic framework packed nanochannel membrane to realize enantioseparation with high selectivity and flux.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Octahedral Cages with Three Types of Chirality towards Spontaneous Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is one of the most important intrinsic properties of (supra)molecules. In this study, we obtained enantiomeric metallo&#8208;supramolecular octahedra without using any chiral sources. Such cages were self&#8208;assembled by prochiral trispyridine ligand  L  based on a  C3h  truxene core and Cu(II) salts. Crystallization of the cages with BF4&#9472;&#160;as counterions afforded racemate crystals; while crystallizations of cages with ClO4&#9472;&#160;and OTf&#9472;&#160;as counterions resulted in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution. Three types of chirality were observed in each cage, including planar chirality of the truxene core, axial chirality from the pyridyl and truxene moieties, and propeller chirality of the pyridyl&#8208;Cu(II) coordination sites. The cages reported here are among the largest discrete synthetic metallo&#8208;supramolecules ever reported with chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior. Remarkably, the chiral cage exhibited very slow racemization even at low concentrations, suggesting their high stability in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Equilibria between Aluminium(I) and Aluminium(III): the Formation of Dihydroalanes, Masked Dialumenes and Aluminium(I) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of new reductive routes to low oxidation state aluminium (Al) compounds offers the opportunity to better understand redox processes at the metal centre and develop reactivity accordingly. Here, a monomeric Al(I) compound acts as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of Al(III) dihydrides, leading to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. These compounds are formed by a series of equilibrium processes involving Al(I), Al(II) and Al(III) species and product formation can be manipulated by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions. The transient formation of monomeric Al(I) compounds is proposed: this is shown to be energetically viable by computational (DFT) investigations and reactivity studies show support for the formation of Al(I) species. Importantly, despite the potential for the equilibrium mixtures to lead to ill&#8208;defined reactivity, controlled reactivity of these low oxidation state species is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Saving the Energy Loss in Lithium&#8208;mediated Nitrogen Fixation by Using Highly Reactive Li3N Intermediate for C&#8211;N Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of N&#8208;containing organic compounds from dinitrogen (N2) can make synthetic chemistry more sustainable. Previous bottlenecks in lithium&#8208;mediated N2  fixation were resolved by loading Li metal anodes covered with the typical Li+  ion&#8208;conducting solid electrolyte interface, which are subsequently allowed to react with N2. The developed strategy allowed us to reach high Faradaic efficiencies toward Li3N. These reactive Li3N were then contacted with acylchlorides. Surface nitride ions are more nucleophilic than amines which direct the two C&#8211;N coupling reactions toward formation of imides rather than amides, and an integrated current efficiency of 57~77% could be realized. This study thereby not only provides a feasible electrochemical Li3N synthesis, but also delineates an economical and green synthesis of highly valuable N&#8208;containing compounds from N2  under mild conditions, just using commercial spare parts and processes from omnipresent Li battery technology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>C&#8208;C bond formation on metal surfaces has attracted great attention as a route toward novel molecular nanostructures under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions. Unlike the extensively explored reactions of aryl halides, we describe the on&#8208;surface dehalogenative homocoupling of benzylic bromides, namely bis&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208; and bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene as a potential route to either hydrocarbon dimers or conjugated polymers on Au (111). While bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene affords different dimers with naphthocyclobutadiene as the key intermediate, bis&#8208;bromomethyl naphthalene furnishes a poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylidene) as a non&#8208;conjugated polymer which undergoes dehydrogenation toward its conjugated derivative poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylene) upon mild annealing. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations provides deep insights into the prevailing mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion&#8208;paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions has been developed. The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), to lysophosphatidylcholine.







Abstract
We describe a concise and reliable protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids (FAs) at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions that is generally applicable to a variety of FAs, including trans&#8208;FAs, polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and their oxidized derivatives. The precisely controlled introduction of four deuterium atoms into the FAs enables their persistent and quantitative tracking by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis based on their molecular structures. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species prepared from the tetradeuterated FAs thus obtained give a diagnostic peak, namely, a phosphocholine fragment that contains deuterium, in the LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. With these features, the metabolism of a representative oxidized linoleic acid, that is, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), was investigated, leading to the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from HODE to lysophosphatidylcholine.

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic biochemical machinery for information processing and communication is essential for the construction of artificial protocells with complex dynamic behaviors. Here we use synthetic transcriptional circuits to produce diffusive RNA signal that can regulate CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing and localization in a binary community of synthetic protocells.







Abstract
Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer a transcriptional module to generate RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.

         <title>Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: a Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.







Abstract
Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl&#8208;magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me2Si(C13H8)2)Nd(&#956;&#8208;BH4)[(&#956;&#8208;BH4)Li(THF)]}2 metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP. Hard and soft blocks such as PB, polystyrene (PS), poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) obtained by anionic polymerization and PE or poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (EBR) produced by CCT(co)P were combined and the corresponding structures were characterized.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylation and Alkene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8722;NiI catalyst promotes regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides to afford trisubstituted borylalkenes and styrenes. The reaction proceeds through branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation followed by trans&#8208;selective allyl isomerization.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;NiI catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing trans alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by trans&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Under Visible Light Enabled by a Particulate Conjugated Polymer Loaded with Palladium and Iridium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone) loaded with Pd/IrO2 facilitates stoichiometric overall water splitting for an extended period after the system stabilized, albeit currently with low activities. The study demonstrates the importance of co&#8208;catalysts for polymer photoatalysts and results were rationalized by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60&#8197;hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Hydroxylated Multi&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes Covalently Modified with Tris(hydroxypropyl) Phosphine as a Functional Interlayer for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic molecules tris (hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THPP) onto hydroxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8208;OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as&#8208;assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of stable SEI layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low&#8208;ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as&#8208;designed lithium&#8208;sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036% per cycle for 1700 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Na/K Alloy Interfacial Synthesis of Functional Porous Carbon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functional groups in porous carbon generally suffer a severe loss during the high&#8208;temperature carbonization. Instead, the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of carbon featuring porous structures and abundant functional groups is not only a solution that evades the pitfalls of pyrolysis but also is of significance for the development of synthetic methodology. Herein, a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy is reported for the synthesis of porous carbon using CCl4 as the carbon precursor and sodium&#8208;potassium alloy (NaK) as the reducing agent, which is superior to traditional synthetic methods because it enables the engineering of a highly active liquid metal alloy microemulsion to directly generate porous carbon at ambient temperature. As synthesized porous carbon featured abundant carbon&#8208;chlorine bonds can be tandem grafted with imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to achieve a CO2 cycloaddition catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity, in addition to exceptional stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free SF6 Activation: A New SF5&#8208;Based Reagent Enables Deoxyfluorination and Pentafluorosulfanylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of SF  6  , a potent greenhouse gas, under metal&#8208;free and visible light conditions is reported. Herein, mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy, NMR studies and cyclic voltammetry allowed the rational design of a new fluorinating reagent which was synthesized from the 2&#8208;electron activation of SF  6  with commercially available TDAE. This new SF  5  &#8208;based reagent was efficiently employed for the deoxyfluorination of CO  2  and the fluorinative desulfurization of CS  2  allowing the formation of useful fluorinated amines. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrated that our SF  5  &#8208;based reagent could afford the mild generation of Cl&#8208;SF  5  gas. This finding was exploited for the chloro&#8208;pentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes and alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Photoluminescent Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles by Electrostatic Mediated Intramolecular Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported large&#8208;scale synthesis of photoluminescent SCNPs by electrostatic mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40 mg/mL by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. The example polymer of poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl&#8208;imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator. Under the electrostatic repulsion thus interchain isolation, the intrachain crosslinking experiences the transition from coil through pearl&#8208;necklace to globular state. The SCNPs demonstrate strong photoluminescence at visible range when the non&#8208;emissive units are confined thereby. Composition and microstructure of the SCNPs are tunable. The example photoluminescent tadpole&#8208;like Janus SCNP can be used to selectively illuminate interfacial membranes while stabilizing the emulsions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;supported nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal site catalysts (i.e., M&#8208;N&#8208;C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8208;M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts by designing dual&#8208;metal active sites. The Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N&#8208;coordinated dual&#8208;metal site configurations are 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual&#8208;metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single&#8208;metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO  2  HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Ammonium Ion Battery: A New Strategy for Nonmetallic Ion Energy Storage System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetallic ammonium (NH  4  +  ) ion batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage system, which have the merit of low molar mass, sustainability, non&#8208;toxicity and non&#8208;dendrite. Herein, for the first time, we introduce the novel organic ammonium ion batteries (OAIBs). Significantly, a manganese&#8208;based Prussian white analogue (noted as MnHCF) as cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 104 mAh g  &#8208;1  with 98% retention over 100 cycles. We further demonstrated the electrochemical performance of NH  4  +  ion full cell, which delivers a reversible capacity of 45 mAh g  &#8208;1  with a broad electrochemical window. Combining ex&#8208;situ XPS, ex&#8208;situ XRD results and electrochemical properties, the NH  4  +  ions storage mechanism of MnHCF in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte is clearly revealed. This work verifies the feasibility of employing NH  4  +  ions as charge carriers in organic energy storage system and provides new insights for designing organic nonmetallic ion batteries with broad electrochemical windows and high energy density.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic application. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (~15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (~3.6 &#956;A/cm2, under 266 nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (~103) and polarization ratio (~2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8211;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8211;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8211;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8211;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Hydrolysis of Block Copolymers at the Water&#8208;Oil Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time pendant drop tensiometry of a toluene solution of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) in water was measured to monitor the conversion of PSM blocks into glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) blocks upon the addition of acid to the aqueous phase. This work provides opportunities to quantitatively monitor responsive block copolymers for structuring liquids.







Abstract
In situ manipulation of the chemical composition of block copolymers at the fluid interfaces affords a route by which the interfacial tension, the packing of the copolymers, and the penetration of the blocks into the two liquids can be controlled. Here, a series of linear block copolymers of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) are used, converting hydrophobic PSM block into a hydrophilic glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) block, that results in a marked decrease in the liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension. The kinetics of the first&#8208;order hydrolysis reaction was analyzed by monitoring the time&#8208;dependent interfacial tension as a function of pH, polymer concentration, molecular weight, and composition. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to measure the in&#8208;plane dynamics of the copolymers before and after hydrolysis. This work provides insights into a quantitative pathway by which in situ interfacial reactions may be performed and monitored in real time, completely changing the interfacial activity of the molecule.

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Free, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted, and Activatable Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy with Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;Situ Therapeutic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free and mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizers (PSs) with the real&#8208;time in situ self&#8208;reporting ability was constructed for photodynamic cancer therapy. Based on the platform, activatable PSs were further developed, and their ability in either selective killing of cancer cells over normal cells or in effectively ablating an implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.







Abstract
Based on spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing mechanism, two heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) BDP1/BDP2 with absorption maxima at 506&#8197;nm/660&#8197;nm were constructed for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The long triplet state lifetimes and large singlet oxygen quantum yields, coupled with the mitochondria&#8208;targeted feature, made them highly phototoxic toward cancer cells. Moreover, the PDT&#8208;promoted cell apoptosis could be monitored by an obvious fluorescence off&#8208;on response of the two PSs due to the concomitant activation of extensive mitophagy, thus facilitating timely therapeutic feedback to avoid under&#8208; or over&#8208;treatment. Importantly, such design allows the activatable PSs Glu&#8208;BDP1/Glu&#8208;BDP2 to be fabricated by attaching &#947;&#8208;glutamyl, a substrate of &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase, to the alkoxyaniline unit of BDP1/BDP2, and their ability in either selectively killing cancer cells over normal cells or in ablating implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.

         <title>(PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6: A Robust Tetravalent Phosphaza&#8208;adamantane Scaffold for Molecular and Macromolecular Construction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new air&#8208;stable and thermally robust tetrahedral tetravalent inorganic cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 has been achieved. This cage allows four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions on its periphery to give unprecedented molecular and macromolecular constructs. This utility is shown by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion and the first all P/N polyphazene network material.







Abstract
Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four&#8208;way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza&#8208;adamantane cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 (2), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes 2 a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound 3) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (5).

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles Enabled by Underexplored Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles from readily available amines was achieved. Key to the disclosed strategy was the development and implementation of reactive &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, providing access to structurally and functionally diverse products. Application of the method is showcased in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.







Abstract
Cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles are featured in various biologically active compounds and represent attractive scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. However, synthesis routes to access structurally and functionally diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles remain underexplored. Leveraging novel &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, we report a general approach for the direct and modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused lactams from unsaturated amines. The operationally simple transformation, which proceeds through successive acylation, (3+2) cycloaddition and fragmentation, tolerates a broad range of functional groups and yields a wide spectrum of complex molecular scaffolds, including fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines: Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more fluorine the better? Pentafluorophosphato amino acids A and B are stable new molecular entities showing surprisingly high binding affinities to the phosphotyrosine binding site of a protein tyrosine phosphatase&#8212;better than the current gold standard for phosphotyrosine mimetics. PF5 motifs display remarkable fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and thus might enable a new class of potent tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8722;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Panowamycins, TM&#8208;135, and Veramycin&#8197;F Using C&#8722;H Insertion with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total Synthesis Shell Game: The asymmetric first synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, veramycin&#8197;F, and two unnatural isomers in a stereoselective fashion, featuring a dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reaction with donor/donor carbenes in the key step to construct the isochroman core. These syntheses reveal a structural misassignment for panowamycin&#8197;A and computational NMR studies unveil the correct configuration of the natural isomer, which was also synthesized.







Abstract
Panowamycins are a group of isochroman&#8208;based natural products first isolated from Streptomyces sp. K07&#8208;0010 in 2012 by Satoshi &#332;mura and co&#8208;workers that exhibit modest anti&#8208;trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond&#8208;forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late&#8208;stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycin&#8197;A and veramycin&#8197;F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycin&#8197;A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer. Concurrent with this work, in 2021 Mahmud and co&#8208;workers came to the same conclusion with an updated NMR analysis of panowamycin&#8197;A. In a divergent, asymmetric sequence, we report the synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, and veramycin&#8197;F.

         <title>Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich aryl acetates derived from (renewable) phenolics were selectively reduced to the corresponding arenes using pinacolborane (HBpin) and a nickel&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system in the green solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The method is applicable to 4&#8208;propylguaiacyl acetate derived from pine wood.







Abstract
Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar&#8722;OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8722;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4&#8208;propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar&#8722;OAc versus ArO&#8722;Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side&#8208;product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond. Hydrodeacyloxylation of a set of aryl alkanoates featured interesting chemoselectivity with a dramatic influence of the length and structure of the alkyl chain on catalysis.

         <title>Concentrated Aqueous Peroxodicarbonate: Efficient Electrosyn&#8208; thesis and Use as Oxidizer in Epoxidations, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of concentrated (&#8776;1.0&#8201;m) peroxodicarbonate solutions was achieved by a newly designed electrolysis cell with an elaborate heat&#8208;transfer system, a ternary K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 electrolyte, and the use of high current densities of above 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Peroxodicarbonate solutions were shown to be powerful and green oxidizers, permitting N&#8208; and S&#8208;oxidations as well as epoxidations.







Abstract
Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&gt;&#160;0.9&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 solutions at high current density of 3.33&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode and a stainless&#8208;steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation, N&#8208;oxidation, and epoxidation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&amp;gt;&#160;0.9&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solutions at high current density of 3.33&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron-doped diamond anode and a stainless-steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxidation, and epoxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adsorption in Reversed Order of C2 Hydrocarbons on an Ultramicroporous Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) shows a reversed adsorption order for C2 hydrocarbons. The C2 hydrocarbon uptake of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follow the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2 and not the usual C2H2&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H6.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks have been widely studied in the separation of C2 hydrocarbons, which usually preferentially bind unsaturated hydrocarbons with the order of acetylene (C2H2)&gt;ethylene (C2H4)&gt;ethane (C2H6). Herein, we report an ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;FBA (H2FBA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)), shows a reversed adsorption order characteristic for C2 hydrocarbons, that the uptake for C2 hydrocarbons of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follows the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm that the completely reversed adsorption order behavior is attributed to the close van der Waals interactions and multiple cooperative C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonds between the framework and C2H6. Moreover, Zn&#8208;FBA exhibits a high selectivity of about 2.9 for C2H6 over C2H4 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. The experimental breakthrough studies show that the high&#8208;purity C2H4 can be obtained from C2H6 and C2H4 mixtures in one step.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Directed Regulation of Structures and Luminescence of Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions were employed to direct the regulation of the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Two novel clusters with triangular bipyramidal CAu6Ag5 (2) and hexagram&#8208;like CAu6Ag6 (3) cores were obtained from the CAu6Ag4 type precursor 1. They exhibit red&#8208; or blue&#8208;shifted luminescence, respectively. Remarkably, the quantum yields of 2 and 3 are one order of magnitude higher than 1.







Abstract
Anions have been used to regulate the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Introducing ClO4&#8722; into orange&#8208;emissive, butterfly&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 (1, PPhpy2=bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenylphosphine) leads to the formation of red&#8208;emissive [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag5(ClO4)3](ClO4)4 (2) with a novel trigonal bipyramidal structure; employing PhCO2&#8722; gives yellow&#8208;emissive, hexagram&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag6(PhCO2)3](BF4)5 (3). Notably, 1 exhibits weak luminescence in CH2Cl2/CH3OH=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (v&#8201;:&#8201;v) with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.05, whereas it was dramatically increased to 0.49 and 0.83 for 2 and 3, respectively. Theoretical calculation confirms that the involvement of anions in the electronic structures is responsible for the shifts of emission. The high QYs of 2 and 3 are attributed to the protection provided by ligands and anions. This work demonstrates that anions may serve as an extra designable factor beyond just counterions for functional metal clusters.
