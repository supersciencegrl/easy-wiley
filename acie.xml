         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Stimulated Efficient Photocatalytic N2 Fixation over Defective BaTiO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model ferroelectric photocatalyst, BaTiO3, was treated with NaBH4 to introduce surface oxygen vacancies (Ov&#8208;BTO). The resultant material offers spin&#8208;polarized regulation and an increased internal electric field (IEF). The function of Ov&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity under an external magnetic field is explored and the positive effect of the external magnetic field phenomenon demonstrated on photocatalytic N2 fixation.







Abstract
Efficient coupling solar energy conversion and N2 fixation by photocatalysis has been shown promising potentials. However, the unsatisfied yield rate of NH3 curbs its forward application. Defective typical perovskite, BaTiO3, shows remarkable activity under an applied magnetic field for photocatalytic N2 fixation with an NH3 yield rate exceeding 1.93&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through steered surface spin states and oxygen vacancies, the electromagnetic synergistic effect between the internal electric field and an external magnetic field is stimulated. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the regulation of electronic and magnetic properties through manipulation of oxygen vacancies and inducement of Lorentz force and spin selectivity effect. The electromagnetic effect suppresses the recombination of photoexcited carriers in semiconducting nanomaterials, which acts synergistically to promote N2 adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV&#8208;vis irradiation.

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphates to Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of PH3 and the reaction of PH3 with H2O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni2P.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH3 and Pn+ species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH3 was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH3 and Pn+ during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH3 and Pn+. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni2P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.

         <title>Covalent Probes for Aggregated Protein Imaging via Michael Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squeeze and react: a bio&#8208;inspired fluorescence color&#8208;switch probe uncovers that covalent Michael addition can generally occur inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color&#8208;switch probe mimicking the photo&#8208;conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620&#8197;nm) when it non&#8208;covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515&#8197;nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color&#8208;switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes.

         <title>Cycloparaphenylene&#8211;Phenalenyl Radical and Its Dimeric Double Nanohoop**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral open&#8208;shell carbon nanoring was achieved by integration of the phenalenyl unit into the cycloparaphenylene framework. It is shown that the spin distribution and reactivity of this hydrocarbon in the shape of a diamond ring are a result of steric and electronic effects and that selective dimerization yields a double nanohoop with a radial&#8208;planar&#8208;radial arrangement of its three &#960;&#8208;conjugated segments comprising a total of 158&#8197;sp2&#8208;carbon atoms.







Abstract
The first example of a neutral spin&#8208;delocalized carbon&#8208;nanoring radical was achieved by integration of the open&#8208;shell phenalenyl unit into cycloparaphenylene (CPP). Spin distribution in this hydrocarbon is localized primarily on the phenalenyl segment and partially on the CPP segment as a consequence of steric and electronic effects. The resulting geometry is reminiscent of a diamond ring, with pseudo&#8208;perpendicular arrangement of the radial and the planar &#960;&#8208;surface. The phenylene rings attached directly to the phenalenyl unit give rise to a steric effect that governs a highly selective dimerization pathway, yielding a giant double nanohoop. Its &#960;&#8208;framework made of 158&#8197;sp2&#8208;carbon atoms was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, which revealed a three&#8208;segment CPP&#8208;peropyrene&#8208;CPP structure. This nanocarbon shows a fluorescence profile characteristic of peropyrene, regardless of which segment gets excited. These results in conjunction with DFT suggest that adjusting the size of the CPP segments in this double nanohoop could deliver donor&#8211;acceptor systems.

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. Macrocycles WQP3 and WQP4 could strongly complex with an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG). Host&#8211;guest complexation served to not only efficiently decrease the PXG's hemolysis in rabbit red blood cells, but also substantially enhance its metabolic stability in presence of proteinase&#8197;K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.







Abstract
Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (Ka) of (4.20&#177;0.23)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46&#177;0.44)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way.

     alt="Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]arenes (WQP&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. Macrocycles WQP3 and WQP4 could strongly complex with an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG). Host&#8211;guest complexation served to not only efficiently decrease the PXG's hemolysis in rabbit red blood cells, but also substantially enhance its metabolic stability in presence of proteinase&#8197;K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]arenes (WQPns, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) of (4.20&#177;0.23)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46&#177;0.44)&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8211;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescence Probe for Monitoring Lipid Droplets/Nucleus Change During Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis regulates cell death through reactive oxygen species associated lipid peroxide accumulation, which is expected to affect the structure and polarity of lipid droplets (LDs), but with no clear evidence. Herein, we report the first example of LD and nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescent probe of CQPP for monitoring polarity change in cellular microenvironment. Due to the appropriate donor&#8208;acceptor structure of CQPP, it offers ratiometric fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime signals to polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP has been successfully applied to report the increase in LD polarity, the homogenization of polarity in LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model. This LD and nucleus dual&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe shows great potential of using fluorescence imaging to study ferroptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Polyimide&#8208;Graphene Heterostructure with Ultra&#8208;fast Interlayer Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) are a class of atomically/molecularly thin crystalline organic 2D materials. They are intriguing candidates for the development of unprecedented organic&#8208;inorganic 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with exotic physicochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of large&#8208;area (cm  2  ), monolayer 2D polyimide (2DPI) with 3.1&#8208;nm lattice. Such 2DPI comprises metal&#8208;free porphyrin and perylene units linked by imide bonds. We further achieve a scalable synthesis of 2DPI&#8208;graphene (2DPI&#8208;G) vdWHs via a face&#8208;to&#8208;face co&#8208;assembly of graphene and 2DPI on the water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (~60 fs) in the resultant 2DPI&#8208;G vdWH upon protonation by acid, which is equivalent to that of the fastest reports among inorganic 2D vdWHs. Such large interlayer electronic coupling is ascribed to the interlayer cation&#8208;&#960; interaction between 2DP and graphene. Our work opens opportunities to develop 2DP&#8208;based vdWHs via the on&#8208;water surface synthesis strategy and highlights the unique interface&#8208;induced optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Giant Heterometallic Polyoxotungstate Supercluster with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical assembly of a giant heterometallic polyoxotungstate supercluster with a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa is reported. Geometrically unrestricted cerium(III) and geometrically restricted dimethyl tin cations linkers are used to gain access to a giant molecular species featuring three different polyoxometalate building units. The compound demonstrates in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. We demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, that is, organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH3)2)2O]4{[CeW5O18] [TeW4O16][CeSn(CH3)2]4[TeW8O31]4}2}46&#8722; (1&#8201;a) features dimensions of ca. 2.2&#215;2.3&#215;3.4&#8197;nm3 and a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa. Structural analysis shows the hierarchical aggregation from several independent subunits. Initial biomedical tests show that 1 features an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells based on an apoptosis pathway. In&#8197;vivo experiments in mice reveal the antiproliferative activity of 1 and open new paths for further development of this new compound class.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Induced Surface Metallization for Ammonia Synthesis under Photoexcitation up to 1550&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x was achieved through the bonding between surface terminal Ti&#8208;F groups and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2 with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting superior photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region.







Abstract
The first observation of surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x induced by fluoride ions is presented. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F&#8722; and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2&#8722;x with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8211;1550&#8197;nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H2 and N2 by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.

         <title>Spherulite&#8208;Like Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer with an amphiphilic corona&#8208;forming block leads to formation of 3D spherulite&#8208;like micelles by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and seeded growth in dilute solution. Micelle growth can be stopped at any stage depending on the unimer feed ratio and provides a powerful model for studying the spherulite growth process.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self&#8208;assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self&#8208;assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite&#8208;like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf&#8208;like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step.

     alt="Spherulite&#8208;Like Micelles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer with an amphiphilic corona&#8208;forming block leads to formation of 3D spherulite&#8208;like micelles by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and seeded growth in dilute solution. Micelle growth can be stopped at any stage depending on the unimer feed ratio and provides a powerful model for studying the spherulite growth process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&#8208;dimensional (1D) and 2D structures by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) can form fascinating hierarchical structures through secondary self&#8208;assembly. But examples of 3D structures formed via hierarchical self&#8208;assembly are rare. Here we report seeded growth experiments in decane of a poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) BCP with an amphiphilic corona forming block in which lenticular platelets grow into classic spherulite&#8208;like uniform colloidally stable structures. These 3D objects are spherically symmetric on the exterior, but asymmetric near the core, where there is a more open structure consisting of sheaf&#8208;like leaves. The most remarkable aspect of these experiments is that growth stops at different stages of growth process, depending upon how much unimer is added in the seeded growth step. The system provides a model for studying spherulitic growth where real&#8208;time observations on their growth at different stages remains challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Spin State Cobalt Cations in Spinel Zinc Cobalt Oxide for Spin Channel Propagation and Active Site Enhancement in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting the initially deficient but cost&#8208;effective catalysts to high&#8208;performing competitors is of significance in developing better catalysts. Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo  2  O  4  ) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water&#8208;electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low&#8208;spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t  2g  6  e  g  0  configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo  2  O  4  is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin&#8208;selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high&#8208;spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo  2  O  4  , while not working for Co  3  O  4  . The activity of the best spin&#8208;state&#8208;engineered ZnCo  2  O  4  outperforms other typical Co&#8208;based oxides. Our work pinpoints the critical influence of the spinel composition on the splitting energy of the metals and further on the feasibility of spin state engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Allene&#8208;Containing Molecules via Enantioselective Reactions of Azolium Cumulenolate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azolium cumulenolates are a special type of intermediates in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. They contain elongated linear structures with three contiguous C=C bonds and sterically unhindered &#945;&#8208;carbon. These structure features make it difficult to develop enantioselective reactions for these intermediates. Here we disclose the first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition reactions of azolium cumulenolates. The reaction starts with alkynals as the precursors for azolium cumulenolate intermediates that undergo enantioselective addition to activated ketones. From the same set of substrates, both allene and spirooxindole products can be obtained with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The allene moieties in our optically enriched products carry rich reactivities and can be transformed to diverse molecules. The spirooxindole scaffolds in our products are important structural motifs in natural products and medicines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Pd(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene Encapsulated Barrel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene shoot lack their real application due to poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Their encapsulation in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd  6  barrel (  1)  , which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six  cis  &#8208;Pd(II) acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for large guest. Interestingly, favorable interaction between the ligand and fullerene (C  60  and C  70  ) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel  1  has stronger binding affinity towards C  70  over C  60  which leads to the predominant extraction of C  70  from their mixture. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels  C  60  1  and C  70  1  were found to be efficient for visible light induced singlet oxygen generation. Such  preferential binding of C  70  and photosensitizing ability of  C  60  1  and C  70  1  are noteworthy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chemical synthesis of homogeneous glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) has been accomplished via the combination of protein and carbohydrate chemistry. This strategy provides a versatile synthetic platform for homogeneous glycosylated RBDs of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein and other related virus proteins and a powerful tool for investigating the functions of RBD glycans.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD&#8208;based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331, and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to decipher carbohydrate structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>Cobalt Diazo&#8208;Compounds: From Nitrilimide to Isocyanoamide via a Diazomethanediide Fleeting Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilylium abstraction from a cobalt nitrilimide complex generates a transient cobalt diazomethanediide complex, which forms a terminal isocyanoamido ligand through a radical de&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Lithium trimethylsilyldiazomethanide and a cobalt (II) precursor with an N&#8208;anchored tris&#8208;NHC (TIMENmes) ligand provide access to the cobalt nitrilimide 1. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry (SC&#8208;XRD) and its electronic structure was examined in detail, including EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analyses. The desilylation of the C&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)nitrilimide reveals a transient complex with an elusive diazomethanediide ligand, which substitutes one of the mesitylene rings of the ancillary ligand through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. This transformation results in the cyclometalated cobalt(II) complex 2, featuring a rare isocyanoamido&#8208;&#954;&#8208;C ligand.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Specific Pro&#8208;amplifier of Reactive Oxygen Species in Cancer Cells</title>

A fluorogenic N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrug activated by reactive oxygen species in vitro and in vivo was developed that is cancer cell specific and targets the endoplasmic reticulum.







Abstract
The folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells, leading to so&#8208;called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading, for example, to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this problem, we have developed ER&#8208;targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy, and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential, and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) murine model.

         <title>An Efficient Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Ni metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) with controlled coordination mode were carefully created through a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis strategy for the first time and adopted as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. The optimized partially unsaturated Ni MOF NSs&#8208;6 exhibits near&#8208;zero overpotential as well as ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, exceeding most electrocatalysts up to date.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation is ultrasonication or solvothermal. Herein, a liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the efficient fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. The active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (RM/L). The Ni MOF NSs display highly RM/L dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where the Ni MOF NSs with the RM/L of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity and production rate of ca. 80&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. As evidenced by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Single&#8208;Handed Helical Spiro&#8208;Conjugated Ladder Polymers through Quantitative and Chemoselective Cyclizations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers were successfully synthesized through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne benzannulations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing optically&#8208;active 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane units as a spiro&#8208;type chiral linkage in the main chain that relies on the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents introduced to the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[a,h]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization. This strategy is applicable to the defect&#8208;free precise synthesis of other varieties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and coplanar ladder polymers that have not been achieved before.

         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;large sized and few layered siloxene nanosheets have been used as a bifunctional photocatalyst in a Li&#8208;O2 battery. Due to its superior photoelectric characters, the assembled photo&#8208;assisted battery has exhibited a breakthrough round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O2 batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.

         <title>Scalable Total Synthesis, IP3R Inhibitory Activity of Desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B, and Effect on Mitochondrial Function and Cancer Cell Survival</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B (dmXeB) is a complex marine natural product that exhibits unique properties as a modulator of calcium signaling with downstream effects on cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism. We report a scalable total synthesis of dmXe&#8201;B by a flexible synthetic strategy that allows for control of oxidation levels and stereochemistry at C9/9&#8242;.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of the oxaquinolizidine marine natural product desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B is based on the early application of Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement, macrolactamization, and a late&#8208;stage installation of the oxaquinolizidine units by lactam reduction. The synthesis serves as the source of material to investigate calcium signaling and its effect on mitochondrial metabolism in various cell types, including cancer cells.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, nonlinear optical response, and incommensurate structural modulations in a new borosulfate LiRb4[B(SO4)4] brings new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.







Abstract
Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8722; super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.

         <title>Biosynthesis of 6&#8208;Hydroxymellein Requires a Collaborating Polyketide Synthase&#8208;like Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new architecture for iterative Type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKS) from fungi has been investigated. TerA is a canonical non&#8208;reducing PKS which interacts with TerB, a fragment of a highly reducing PKS containing a functional ketoreductase. Interaction appears to be mediated between a non&#8208;functional dehydratase domain of TerB and the TerA product template domain. Working together, TerAB synthesises 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a precursor of terrein and other fungal metabolites.







Abstract
The polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;like protein TerB, consisting of inactive dehydratase, inactive C&#8208;methyltransferase, and functional ketoreductase domains collaborates with the iterative non reducing PKS TerA to produce 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a key pathway intermediate during the biosynthesis of various fungal natural products. The catalytically inactive dehydratase domain of TerB appears to mediate productive interactions with TerA, demonstrating a new mode of trans&#8208;interaction between iterative PKS components.

         <title>Chemical Reduction of a Nanosized [6]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle &#960;&#8208;conjugation: The two&#8208;fold reduction of [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP) with Li and K metals affords the doubly reduced macrocycle with a large 62&#960; conjugated system, enhanced aromaticity, and variable metal complexation patterns.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP, 1), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly&#8208;reduced state of 1. The macrocyclic 12&#8722; anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the formation of contact&#8208;ion complexes with one Li+ and two K+ ions in THF, and a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion in the solvent&#8208;separated ion product with K+ ions in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The detailed structural analysis of 12&#8722; showed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the biaryl linkages between naphthylene panels were enhanced upon two&#8208;fold reduction, which was rationally explained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Unravelling the Structure of a Medium&#8208;Sized Metalloid Gold Nanocluster and its Filming Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Au67(SCH2Ph)35 nanocluster was synthesized and its structure unravelled, which is the first one resolved by SCXC for thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the size range from Au61 to Au91. Au67(SCH2Ph)35 can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film, which exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a SERS substrate for sensing malachite green, methylene blue and Sudan III.







Abstract
Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium&#8208;sized range by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix&#8208;structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate&#8208;universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.

         <title>In Vivo Subcellular Mass Spectrometry Enables Proteo&#8208;Metabolomic Single&#8208;Cell Systems Biology in a Chordate Embryo Developing to a Normally Behaving Tadpole (X. laevis)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry was advanced to enable dual characterization of proteins and metabolites in identified cells in Xenopus laevis embryos. The analyzed embryos developed to normally behaving tadpoles with anatomy and visual function indistinguishable from that of their control siblings in a background color preference assay. In vivo single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry expands the analytical toolbox of molecular systems, cell, and developmental biology.







Abstract
We report the development of in vivo subcellular high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for proteo&#8208;metabolomic molecular systems biology in complex tissues. With light microscopy, we identified the left&#8208;dorsal and left&#8208;ventral animal cells in cleavage&#8208;stage non&#8208;sentient Xenopus laevis embryos. Using precision&#8208;translated fabricated microcapillaries, the subcellular content of each cell was double&#8208;probed, each time swiftly (&lt;5&#8197;s/event) aspirating &lt;5&#8201;% of cell volume (&#8776;10&#8197;nL). The proteins and metabolites were analyzed by home&#8208;built ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization employing orbitrap or time&#8208;of&#8208;flight HRMS. Label&#8208;free detection of &#8776;150 metabolites (57 identified) and 738 proteins found proteo&#8208;metabolomic networks with differential quantitative activities between the cell types. With spatially and temporally scalable sampling, the technology preserved the integrity of the analyzed cells, the neighboring cells, and the embryo. 95&#8201;% of the analyzed embryos developed into sentient tadpoles that were indistinguishable from their wild&#8208;type siblings based on anatomy and visual function in a background color preference assay.

&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry was advanced to enable dual characterization of proteins and metabolites in identified cells in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; embryos. The analyzed embryos developed to normally behaving tadpoles with anatomy and visual function indistinguishable from that of their control siblings in a background color preference assay. In vivo single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry expands the analytical toolbox of molecular systems, cell, and developmental biology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the development of in vivo subcellular high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for proteo&#8208;metabolomic molecular systems biology in complex tissues. With light microscopy, we identified the left&#8208;dorsal and left&#8208;ventral animal cells in cleavage&#8208;stage non&#8208;sentient Xenopus laevis embryos. Using precision&#8208;translated fabricated microcapillaries, the subcellular content of each cell was double&#8208;probed, each time swiftly (&amp;lt;5&#8197;s/event) aspirating &amp;lt;5&#8201;% of cell volume (&#8776;10&#8197;nL). The proteins and metabolites were analyzed by home&#8208;built ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization employing orbitrap or time&#8208;of&#8208;flight HRMS. Label&#8208;free detection of &#8776;150 metabolites (57 identified) and 738 proteins found proteo&#8208;metabolomic networks with differential quantitative activities between the cell types. With spatially and temporally scalable sampling, the technology preserved the integrity of the analyzed cells, the neighboring cells, and the embryo. 95&#8201;% of the analyzed embryos developed into sentient tadpoles that were indistinguishable from their wild&#8208;type siblings based on anatomy and visual function in a background color preference assay.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling Electrochemical Urea Synthesis by Co&#8208;Activation of CO2 and N2 with Mott&#8211;Schottky Heterostructure Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The space&#8211;charge region in Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures promotes the targeted adsorption and activation of inert N2 and CO2 molecules and further guarantees the exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates with generated CO via C&#8211;N coupling reactions to form the urea precursor *NCON*.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N bond coupling to convert CO2 and N2 molecules into urea under ambient conditions is a promising alternative to harsh industrial processes. However, the adsorption and activation of inert gas molecules and then the driving of the C&#8211;N coupling reaction is energetically challenging. Herein, novel Mott&#8211;Schottky Bi&#8208;BiVO4 heterostructures are described that realize a remarkable urea yield rate of 5.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 12.55&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. Comprehensive analysis confirms the emerging space&#8211;charge region in the heterostructure interface not only facilitates the targeted adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 molecules on the generated local nucleophilic and electrophilic regions, but also effectively suppresses CO poisoning and the formation of endothermic *NNH intermediates. This guarantees the desired exothermic coupling of *N=N* intermediates and generated CO to form the urea precursor, *NCON*.

         <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Dynamics in Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks to Generate Metal&#8211;Oxide and Metal&#8211;Carbon Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular complexation is a powerful strategy for engineering materials in bulk and at interfaces. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive motifs, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (~0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvating and Low&#8208;Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of cosolvents with non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) properties can intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ and regulate the solvation structures in electrolytes, which favors an upgraded anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potential in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). Herein, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively charged anion&#8211;cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent.

         <title>Drop&#8208;Casting to Make Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MAPbI3 crystal growth in the films made by drop&#8208;casting is regulated by changing the temperature. At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI3 films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI3 films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI3 solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.

At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&amp;gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &amp;gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Mediated C&#947;&#8722;H Functionalization of Alicyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to selectively transform C&#947;&#8722;H bonds of alicyclic amines to C&#947;(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds is described. This method is enabled via the pre&#8208;complexation of the amine substrate with palladium followed by the addition of oxidant to yield bioactive motifs functionalized at the &#947;&#8208;position.







Abstract
This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C&#947;&#8722;H versus C&#945;&#8722;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8208;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Bioinspired Synergistic Photochromic Luminescence and Programmable Liquid Crystal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergic allochroic and shape&#8208;morphing bio&#8208;functions like caterpillars and cephalopods, photochromic luminescent liquid crystal actuators were prepared. Complex movements and fluorescent colors can be synergically manipulated by light based on the phase transition of liquid crystals and photoresponse of the fluorescent chromophores after the actuators were programmed with hybrid mesogenic alignments.







Abstract
Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability that can be manipulated in situ with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio&#8208;mimic functions and light&#8208;induced auxetic metamaterial&#8208;like devices were shown to be feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami&#8208;programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities provide an elegant strategy to design multi&#8208;functional liquid crystal actuators.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented Ag(I)&#8208;catalyzed efficient method for the coupling of &#946;&#8208;oxoimides and enol diazoacetates through a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8208;O bond cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process is reported. The general class of imino ethers that includes oxazolines, benzoxazoles and benzimidates are applicable substrates for these reactions that provide direct access to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. High variability in substitution at the pyrrole 2&#8208;, 5&#8208; and  N  &#8208;positions characterizes this methodology that also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting  N  &#8208;functional pyrroles.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of Mars&#8208;Van&#8208;Krevelen Mechanism in the Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Ni Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation is a crucial reaction for renewable energy conversion and storage. Among the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, NiFe based oxyhydroxides show the highest catalytic activity. However, the details of their OER mechanism are still unclear, due to the elusive nature of the OER intermediates. Here by using a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) cell interface, we performed water isotope&#8208;labelled experiments in 18O&#8208;labelled alkaline electrolyte on Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. Our experiments confirm the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both catalysts to various degrees, which involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst and the electrolyte. The quantitative charge analysis suggests that the participating lattice oxygen atoms belong exclusively to the catalyst surface, confirming DFT computational hypotheses. Also, DEMS data suggest a fundamental correlation between the magnitude of the lattice oxygen mechanism and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen controlled by pseudocapacitive oxidative metal redox charges.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxo Species Formed in the Bulk of Silicate Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxo formation is the crucial step in oxygen redox. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100730), Bjoern Schwarz, Xiao&#8197;Cheng Zeng, Jun Li et&#8197;al. report on the reversible peroxo species formed and confined in high&#8208;capacity silicate cathodes. The picture shows the dominating binding mode of peroxo species, which forms in the delithiation amid high&#8208;voltage charging and reverses in the lithium re&#8208;intercalation during discharging. The reversible oxygen transformation following cationic redox offers the prospect of high energy with high safety for lithium&#8208;ion battery.

In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202100730"&gt;10.1002/anie.202100730&lt;/a&gt;), Bjoern Schwarz, Xiao&#8197;Cheng Zeng, Jun Li et&#8197;al. report on the reversible peroxo species formed and confined in high&#8208;capacity silicate cathodes. The picture shows the dominating binding mode of peroxo species, which forms in the delithiation amid high&#8208;voltage charging and reverses in the lithium re&#8208;intercalation during discharging. The reversible oxygen transformation following cationic redox offers the prospect of high energy with high safety for lithium&#8208;ion battery.

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles have emerged as a highly attractive and promising platform for the visualisation of complex biological and pathological processes. This Minireview discusses different strategies based on polymeric nanoparticles for enhanced bioimaging applications. Solutions to overcome problems in the existing systems are also proposed.







Abstract
In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have become increasingly popular for in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo bioimaging because of their excellent versatility and exceptional optical properties. Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this Minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017&#8211;2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. A particular focus is placed on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near&#8208;infrared dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems are summarized and potential solutions offered to overcome them. Finally, some critical considerations in regard to the design of polymeric NPs are given for future bioimaging and sensing applications.

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on a Porous Copper Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous Cu electrocatalyst showed long&#8208;term stability for over 240&#8197;h in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The mixed Cu0 and Cu+ oxidation state induced by the residual Cl the porous sheet&#8208;like morphology were the key to the catalytic stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the emission of CO2 and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Herein, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst exhibits high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8&#8201;% at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240&#8197;h. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu0/Cu+ species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are critical to the high FE of C2+ in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Coated Organic Crystals with Solvent&#8208;Resistant Capacity and Optical Waveguiding Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic crystals with polymer composite coatings which involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (PDDA/PSS)9 polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and a succeeding PVA layer are reported. The PVA&#8208;(PDDA/PSS)9&#8208;coated single crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in a variety of organic solvents without being damaged and as optical waveguides are as efficient as the uncoated crystals.







Abstract
Recently, luminescent organic crystals have been widely studied as new optoelectronic materials. However, corrosion and dissolution of organic crystals by solvents have always been a great challenge for the application of organic crystals in various fields. In this work, we propose a general method of fabricating a solvent&#8208;resistant coating to prevent organic crystals from being corroded or dissolved by organic solvents. The coatings involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) onto crystals, followed by immersing the coated crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions for 2&#8197;minutes. The coated crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in common organic solvents without being damaged and even insoluble in dichloromethane for 5&#8197;days. Moreover, the thin and transparent coatings have little effect on the optical properties of crystals which still have excellent optical waveguide performance with the coatings.

         <title>Adapting and Remolding: Orchestrating Tumor Microenvironment Normalization with Photodynamic Therapy by Size Transformable Nanoframeworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a core&#8208;satellite nanoframework (T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold tumor microenvironment (TME) via MMP2&#8208;triggered size transformation, TGF&#946; inhibition&#8208;mediated stroma remodeling and hemoglobin&#8208;enabled hypoxia relief. By coordinating TME normalization with photodynamic therapy (PDT), superior therapeutic outcomes could be gained in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.







Abstract
Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis and establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. We designed a core&#8208;satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare&#8208;Earth MOFs via ab&#8197;initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks with DOBDC linkers. For the first time, spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker.







Abstract
Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Herein, an extensive set of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO2 without the presence of H2O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Herein, an extensive set of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triarylmethanes and their Medium&#8208;Ring Analogues by Unactivated Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement of Benzanilides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conformationally accelerated intramolecular arylation provides an operationally simple way to prepare triarylmethanes and their medium&#8208;ring analogues. In&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy and a Hammett plot revealed mechanistic details of the electronically unactivated SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement) of the anions of 2&#8208;benzyl benzanilides leads to triarylmethanes in an operationally simple manner. The reaction succeeds even without electronic activation of the ring that plays the role of electrophile in the SNAr reaction, being accelerated instead by the preferred conformation imposed by the tertiary amide tether. The amide substituent of the product may be removed or transformed into alternative functional groups. A ring&#8208;expanding variant (n&#8197;to n+4) of the reaction provided a route to doubly benzo&#8208;fused medium ring lactams of 10 or 11&#8197;members. Hammett analysis returned a &#961;&#8197;value consistent with the operation of a partially concerted reaction mechanism.

         <title>Improving Bioavailability of Hydrophobic Prodrugs through Supramolecular Nanocarriers Based on Recombinant Proteins for Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of protein&#8208;based nanodrugs was developed driven by supramolecular assembly. The nanodrug exhibited significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma models, allowing long&#8208;acting osteosarcoma treatment. Side effects including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis were greatly mitigated with this medication.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanodrug assembly driven by supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulations is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein&#8208;based nanodrug carriers, which is very efficient for loading and delivering the hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. The half&#8208;life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability increased by 17&#8208;fold. This is significantly superior to other drug counterparts, empowering long&#8208;acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off&#8208;target side effects of the prodrug, including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis, were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy enables the customized design of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.

         <title>The Electrophilicity of Surface Carbon Species in the Redox Reactions of CuO&#8208;CeO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the oxidation of CO over the surface of a CuO&#8208;CeO2 catalyst, electrons are simultaneously transferred from Cu0 to lattice Ce4+ and surface carbon species deposited from CO. These &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support&#8211;carbon interactions&#8221; (EMSCI) are thought to play an important role in the reactions involving the support and surface carbon species in C1 chemistry.







Abstract
Electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSI) describe the electron flow between metal sites and a metal oxide support. It is generally used to follow the mechanism of redox reactions. In this study of CuO&#8208;CeO2 redox, an additional flow of electrons from metallic Cu to surface carbon species is observed via a combination of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, near ambient pressure near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. An electronic metal&#8211;support&#8211;carbon interaction (EMSCI) is proposed to explain the reaction pathway of CO oxidation. The EMSCI provides a complete picture of the mass and electron flow, which will help predict and improve the catalytic performance in the selective activation of CO2, carbonate, or carbonyl species in C1 chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Protease Activation on a Multimeric Synthetic Protein Scaffold via Adaptable DNA&#8208;Based Recruitment Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexameric protein recruitment platform allows controlled assembly and activation of caspase&#8208;9 enzymes using short DNA sequences as modular recruitment domains. Simple molecular tuning of the DNA recruitment domains enables reversible switching or kinetic inhibition of the proximity&#8208;induced enzyme activation.







Abstract
Hexameric hemoprotein (HTHP) is employed as a scaffold protein for the supramolecular assembly and activation of the apoptotic signalling enzyme caspase&#8208;9, using short DNA elements as modular recruitment domains. Caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activation on the HTHP platform due to enhanced proximity is followed by combinatorial inhibition at high scaffold concentrations. The DNA recruitment domains allow for reversible switching of the caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activity state using short modulatory DNA strands. Tuning of the recruitment domain affinity allows for generating kinetically trapped active enzyme complexes, as well as for dynamic repositioning of caspases over scaffold populations and inhibition using monovalent sink platforms. The conceptual combination of a highly structured multivalent protein platform with modular DNA recruitment domains provides emergent biomimicry properties with advanced levels of control over protein assembly.

A family of 6&#8208;connected trimer&#8208;based MOFs with 6&#8208;coordinated metals has been developed from rare&#8208;earth elements. A confluence of factors have been identified to lead to such unusual low&#8208;coordinate rare&#8208;earth MOFs that prove to be a powerful platform enabling dramatically enhanced efficiency for rare&#8208;earth separation.







Abstract
For rare&#8208;earth separation, selective crystallization into metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM&#8208;66) with low&#8208;coordination&#8208;number environment for rare&#8208;earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare&#8208;earth ions and shows exceptional ion&#8208;size selectivity during crystallization. CPM&#8208;66 family are based on M3O trimers (M=6&#8208;coordinated Sc, In, Er&#8208;Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea&#8208;type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.

         <title>Fabrication of Gradient and Patterned Organic Thin Films by Bipolar Electrolytic Micelle Disruption Using Redox&#8208;active Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar electrochemistry could be regarded as a powerful approach for selective surface modification due to the beneficial feature that a wirelessly controllable potential distribution on bipolar electrodes (BPEs). Herein we report a bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system for the preparation of shaped organic films. A U&#8208;shaped bipolar electrolytic system with a sigmoidal potential gradient on the BPE gave gradient&#8208;thin films including various interesting organic compounds, such as a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules. The gradient feature was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption, thickness measurements and surface morphology analysis. Corresponding patterned films were also fabricated using a cylindrical bipolar electrolytic setup that enables site&#8208;selective application of the potential on the BPE. Such a facile BEMD approach will open a long&#8208;term perspective with respect to organic film preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Copolymers That Shouldn't Be</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected excited&#8208;state conjugation was observed in a series of copolymers derived from ladder silsesquioxane, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, which exhibited 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted emission relative to double&#8208;decker derived analogues with equal or larger degrees of polymerization. Further studies hint at their potential application as semiconducting polymers.







Abstract
Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well&#8208;defined structures and physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we report unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O0.5)2][PhSiO1.5]8[(O0.5)2Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red&#8208;shifts relative to model compounds, implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O&#8208;)2 siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation, we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm emission red&#8208;shifts beyond those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs despite lacking a true cage. Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene, and thienothiophene with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% F4TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Behind the Roughness&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism behind the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide is revealed by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for the reaction on catalysts with different roughness factors (RF). Ways to enhance the reaction selectivity are predicated.







Abstract
High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.

         <title>Chemical Fueling Enables Molecular Complexification of Self&#8208;Replicators**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical fueling enables complex self&#8208;replicating molecules to outcompete structurally simpler and faster replicators, revealing an important mechanism behind complexification that is required to transform chemistry into biology.







Abstract
Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible. Such complexification represents an important requirement for achieving open&#8208;ended evolution as it should allow improved and ultimately also new functions to emerge.

         <title>Cluster From Cluster: A Quantitative Approach to Magic Gold Nanoclusters [Au25(SR)18]&#8208;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High yield and large scale synthesis are highly demanded for the studies of gold nanoclusters. We developed a &#8220;cluster from cluster&#8221; approach to assemble gold nanoclusters with preformed atomically precise Au  13  precursors. This facile approach has proved to be very effective in the synthesis of the well&#8208;known magic cluster  [Au  25  (SR)  18  ]  &#8208;  ,  which could prepare the target cluster in high yield (overall yield up to ~100%) at large scale (gram&#8208;scale based on gold). This method can be applied in the synthesis of 10  Au  25  clusters with different R groups. This work presents an important approach that may be extended to high yield and large scale synthesis of other metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

This facile approach has proved to be very effective in the synthesis of the well&#8208;known magic cluster  [Au  25  (SR)  18  ]  &#8208;  ,  which could prepare the target cluster in high yield (overall yield up to ~100%) at large scale (gram&#8208;scale based on gold). This method can be applied in the synthesis of 10  Au  25  clusters with different R groups. This work presents an important approach that may be extended to high yield and large scale synthesis of other metal nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Double Deprotonation Strategy for Cascade Annulations of Palladium&#8208;Trimethylenemethanes and Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman Carbonates to Construct Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>Here we report that the chemoselective activation of Tsuji&#8242;s 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl) allyl carbonates to generate the palladium&#8208;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles via a deprotonation strategy can be realized in the presence of Morita&#8722;Baylis&#8722;Hillman carbonates from substantial activated ketones. The following SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition enables the formation of new 1,3&#8208;dipole species having an activated alkene moiety through a second deprotonation process, which then undergo cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations to furnish complex bicyclic [3.1.0]hexane frameworks with three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers with good to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, by using benzoyl aldehyde&#8208;derived substrates, a [1+4]/[3+2] annulation sequence is similarly developed to produce fused cyclopenta[b]furan architectures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a pyrazolate&#8208;bridged dinucleating ligand that provides two proximate pincer&#8208;type PNN binding sites (&#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one pincer&#8221;), different synthetic routes have been developed towards its dicobalt(I) complex  2  that features a twice deprotonated ligand backbone and two weakly activated terminal N2  substrate ligands directed into the bimetallic pocket. Protonation of  2  is shown to occur at the ligand scaffold and to trigger conversion to a tetracobalt(I) complex  4  with two end&#8208;on &#181;1,2  &#8208;bridging N2; in THF  4  is labile and undergoes temperature&#8208;dependent N2/triflate ligand exchange.

         <title>Orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller Isomerism in the Dark&#8208;Stable State of Nature&#8217;s Water Oxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetramanganese&#8211;calcium cluster of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II adopts electronically and magnetically distinct but interconvertible valence isomeric forms in its first light&#8208;driven oxidized catalytic state, S  2  . This bistability is implicated in gating the final catalytic states preceding O&#8211;O bond formation, but it is unknown how the biological system enables its emergence and controls its effect. Here we show that the Mn  4  CaO  5  cluster in the resting (dark&#8208;stable) S  1  state adopts orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomeric forms arising from a directional change in electronic configuration of the &#8220;dangler&#8221; Mn(III) ion. The isomers are consistent with available structural data and explain previously unresolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic observations on the S  1  state. This unique isomerism in the resting state is shown to be the electronic origin of valence isomerism in the S  2  state, establishing a functional role of orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism unprecedented in biological or artificial catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dearomatization is an effective method to transform readily available N&#8208;heterocycles into partially saturated motifs. Manipulation of dihydro&#8208;derivatives holds great potential and provides access to a variety of semi&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. However, current strategies are limited in scope and the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. In this work, we report the synthesis of a broad variety of  N  &#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines by very mild and selective reduction with amine borane for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Mediated Energy Transfer in Heterojunction Enables Infrared Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared light accounts for almost half energy of the sunlight, while it is still a huge challenge to efficiently utilize the long wavelength light. Although a few semiconductors can directly absorb infrared light, their intrinsic properties like improper band&#8208;edge position and strong electron&#8208;hole interaction restrict further photocatalytic applications. Herein, we propose an exciton&#8208;mediated energy transfer strategy for realizing efficient infrared light response in heterostructures. Taking black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction as an example, we show that CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8208;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Rapid Synthesis of Pd&#8208;Based Ultrathin Porous Intermetallic Nanosheets for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This template&#8208;directed synthetic strategy is a universal route for shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanocrystals and will provide new opportunities for intermetallic nanocatalysts.







Abstract
Atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles exhibit improved catalytic activity and durability relative to random alloy counterparts. However, conventional methods with time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;temperature syntheses only have rudimentary capability in controlling the structure of intermetallic nanoparticles, hindering advances of intermetallic nanocatalysts. We report a template&#8208;directed strategy for rapid synthesis of Pd&#8208;based (PdM, M=Pb, Sn and Cd) ultrathin porous intermetallic nanosheets (UPINs) with tunable sizes. This strategy uses preformed seeds, which act as the template to control the deposition of foreign atoms and the subsequent interatomic diffusion. Using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a model reaction, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Pb UPINs exhibit superior activity, durability, and methanol tolerance. The favored geometrical structure and interatomic interaction between Pd and Pb in Pd3Pb UPINs are concluded to account for the enhanced ORR performance.

         <dc:description>
Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses chemical energy stored in molecules to sustain non&#8208;equilibrium structures. This Review describes how chemical energy can be used to control the self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules. The ability of chemists to implement the described strategies in a synthetic context will permit the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly. We discuss the meaning of non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, its kinetic origin, and strategies to develop synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Carbon Monoxide Release Enables Selective Eradication of MRSA Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) has been known as an important gaseous signaling molecule. The use of CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) such as metal carbonyls offers the possibility to elucidate the pleiotropic physiological functions of CO. Although metal carbonyls show a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity, it remains unclear whether the bactericidal property originates from the transition metals or the released CO. Herein, we develop nonmetallic micellar nanoparticles for localized CO delivery via a photooxygenation mechanism of 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone derivatives, enabling CO release under red light irradiation (e.g., 650 nm). In sharp contrast to metal carbonyls that non&#8208;specifically internalize into both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and show a broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity, the nonmetallic micelles were selectively taken up by  Staphylococcus aureus  (  S. aureus  ) instead of  Escherichia coli  (  E. coil  ) cells, exerting a selective bactericidal effect toward  S. aureus  . Further, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;free micelles can cure methicillin&#8208;resistant  S. aureus  (MRSA)&#8208;infected wounds in a full&#8208;thickness skin wound model by taking advantage of the localized release CO, simultaneously eradicating MRSA pathogens and accelerating wound healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon Near Infrared Responsiveness From Molecular to Supramolecular Levels via Platination of Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsiveness is important for various applications. Currently, single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems are rare compared to those achieved by two&#8208;photon absorption and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation processes. Supramolecular stacking of photo&#8208;responsive chromophores results in the decreased efficiency due to the space confining effects. To address these issues, herein  &#963;  &#8208;platination of pentacenes is served as a feasible protocol to build single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems, which brings advantages including low HOMO&#8210;LUMO energy gap, high photo&#8208;chemical efficiency and pathway specificity. The pentacene&#8208;to&#8208;endoperoxidation transformation is accompanied by color and absorbance changes. The high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency of  &#963;  &#8208;platinated pentacenes facilitates NIR responsiveness in one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, giving rise to the disappearance of supramolecular chirality signals and disruption of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers. Overall, the  &#963;  &#8208;platination strategy opens up new avenues toward NIR photo&#8208;responsive materials at molecular and supramolecular levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific aptamer chimeras were designed and constructed for lysosomal degradation of targeted membrane&#8208;associated proteins (see picture). The method provides a powerful and potentially universal platform for the use of inexpensive and readily synthesized aptamer materials for the clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular medicine.







Abstract
The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we describe a platform for the targeted degradation of membrane&#8208;associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane&#8208;bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK&#8208;7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for the use of readily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and potential therapeutics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical aza&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type cyclization reaction that is free of catalyst, oxidant, supporting electrolyte, and additives is presented. The method is scalable and compatible with di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable methods to access saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is of great importance because of the prevalence of these structures in natural products and bioactive compounds. Pd&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization is a powerful method and provides access to N&#8208;heterocycles bearing an alkene moiety available for further synthetic manipulations from readily available materials. Herein we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free formal aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization reaction for the synthesis of functionalized saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Key to the success is to conduct the reactions in a continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical reactor without adding supporting electrolyte or additives. The reactions are characterized by broad tolerance of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Less Unfavorable Salt Bridges on the Enzyme Surface Result in More Organic Cosolvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By removing unfavorable surface salt bridges, the organic solvent and thermal resistance of enzymes can be significantly improved. This design strategy results in locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration.







Abstract
Biocatalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals is highly attractive but usually requires organic (co&#8208;)solvents (OSs). However, native enzymes often have low activity and resistance in OSs and at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a smart salt bridge design strategy for simultaneously improving OS resistance and thermostability of the model enzyme, Bacillus subtilits Lipase&#8197;A (BSLA). We combined comprehensive experimental studies of 3450 BSLA variants and molecular dynamics simulations of 36 systems. Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.

Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>XFEL Crystal Structures of Peroxidase Compound II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen activation in all heme enzymes requires the formation of high oxidation states of iron, usually referred to as ferryl heme. There are two known intermediates: Compound I and Compound II. The nature of the ferryl heme &#8211; and whether it is an Fe  IV  =O or Fe  IV  &#8208;OH species &#8211; is important for controlling reactivity across groups of heme enzymes. The most recent evidence for Compound I indicates that the ferryl heme is an unprotonated Fe  IV  =O species. For Compound II, the nature of the ferryl heme is not unambiguously established. Here, we report 1.06 &#197; and 1.50 &#197; crystal structures for Compound II intermediates in cytochrome  c  peroxidase (C  c  P) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), collected using the X&#8208;ray free electron laser at SACLA. The structures reveal differences between the two peroxidases. The iron&#8208;oxygen bond length in C  c  P (1.76 &#197;) is notably shorter than in APX (1.87 &#197;). The results indicate that the ferryl species is finely tuned across Compound I and Compound II species in closely related peroxidase enzymes. We propose that this fine&#8208;tuning is linked to the functional need for proton delivery to the heme.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes from Flex&#8208;Activated Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have discovered a new flex&#8208;activated mechanophore that releases an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) under mechanical load. The mechanophore design is based upon NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts, and demonstrates an important first&#8208;step toward functional flex&#8208;activated designs. Since the flex&#8208;activation is non&#8208;destructive to the main polymer chains, the material can be subjected to multiple compression cycles to achieve iterative increases in the activation percentage of mechanophores. Two different NHC structures were demonstrated, signifying the potential modularity of the mechanophore design.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Single Protein&#8208;Chain Reporter for Opioid Detection at Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically&#8208;encoded fluorescent sensor was designed for the mu&#8208;opioid receptor using a novel sensor mechanism. In the absence of opioids, Nb39 interacts with the circular permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) and inhibits the fluorophore maturation of cpGFP. When the opioid binds to the opioid receptor (OR), Nb39 binds to the intracellular side of the activated OR. This removes Nb39 from cpGFP, allowing the cpGFP fluorophore to mature, resulting in an opioid&#8208;induced fluorescence increase.







Abstract
Mu&#8208;opioid receptor (MOR) signaling regulates multiple neuronal pathways, including those involved in pain, reward, and respiration. To advance the understanding of MOR's roles in pain modulation, there is a need for high&#8208;throughput screening methods of opioids in vitro and high&#8208;resolution mapping of opioids in the brain. To fill this need, we designed and characterized a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, called Single&#8208;chain Protein&#8208;based Opioid Transmission Indicator Tool for MOR (M&#8208;SPOTIT). M&#8208;SPOTIT represents a new and unique mechanism for fluorescent reporter design and can detect MOR activation, leaving a persistent green fluorescence mark for image analysis. M&#8208;SPOTIT showed an opioid&#8208;dependent signal to noise ratio (S/N) up to 12.5 and was able to detect as fast as a 30&#8208;second opioid exposure in HEK293T cell culture. Additionally, it showed an opioid&#8208;dependent S/N up to 4.6 in neuronal culture and detected fentanyl with an EC50 of 15&#8197;nM. M&#8208;SPOTIT will potentially be useful for high&#8208;throughput detection of opioids in cell cultures and cellular&#8208;resolution detection of opioids in vivo. M&#8208;SPOTIT's novel mechanism can be used as a platform to design other G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptor&#8208;based sensors.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoredox [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction was developed for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles, which is initiated by a novel process of single&#8208;electron transfer from the enaminone moiety.







Abstract
A novel method for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles in high yields was developed. The method involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, photocatalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/ retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction of enaminones. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the reaction is a photoredox process initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation of an enaminone moiety, which undergoes subsequent cyclobutane formation and rapidly fragmentation in a radical&#8208;cation state to form cyclohepta[b]indoles.

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer driven valence tautomerism and redox noninnocence of unexplored azobis(benzothiazole) on coordination to {Ru(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedianato) have been illustrated in the context of designing reversible electron reservoir system for the potential application in catalysis and material science.







Abstract
The impact of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {RuII(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedionato). It led to the authentication of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes incorporating variable oxidation states of abbt (abbt0/.&#8722;/2&#8722;). Mononuclear 1 was identified as [RuIII(abbt.&#8722;)], a MLCT excited state of [RuII(abbt)]. Dinuclear 2 was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed&#8208;valent meso&#8208;[Ru2.5(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;)Ru2.5] (2a) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso&#8208;[RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt2&#8722;)RuIII] (2b), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo&#8208;based ligand systems. A crystal structure of [2]ClO4 validated the formation of [RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;) RuIII]ClO4. Analysis of electronic structural forms of 1 and 2 in accessible redox states via spectroelectrochemistry and DFT revealed their electron reservoir feature.

Dinuclear &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed&#8208;valent meso&#8208;[Ru&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;(&#956;&#8208;abbt&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)Ru&lt;sup&gt;2.5&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2a&lt;/b&gt;) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso&#8208;[Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#956;&#8208;abbt&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2b&lt;/b&gt;), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo&#8208;based ligand systems. A crystal structure of [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; validated the formation of [Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(&#956;&#8208;abbt&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;]ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Analysis of electronic structural forms of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in accessible redox states via spectroelectrochemistry and DFT revealed their electron reservoir feature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of two fully unsaturated pentagons to the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) core gives access to two dicyclopentaannelated HBC regioisomers: mPHBC and pPHBC. Both compounds show decreased energy gaps compared with the parent HBC and exhibit singlet biradical ground state with prominent biradical character.







Abstract
Synthesis of two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers was carried out, using nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be generated and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC &#960;&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Propargylic Phosphinylation of Propargylic Alcohols with Phosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles is reported. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
The development of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions has gained much progress in recent years, however, no successful example with phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles has yet been reported until now. Herein, we report the first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.

         <dc:description>
Previously, we showcased Z&#8208;selective Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides. In contrast, we describe herein the MBH&#8208;type rearrangement of aryl iodanes with the opposite stereoselectivity. Both protocols complement each other allowing for the synthesis of E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives on demand.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls represent an important class of derivatizable synthetic intermediates, however, the synthesis of such compounds still remains a challenge. Recently, we showcased a novel Z&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with aryl sulfoxides via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involving an Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) process. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible reaction pathway and provide an explanation for the opposite stereoselectivities.

         <title>Chiral Superatomic Nanoclusters Ag47 Induced by the Ligation of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids protected silver nanoclusters with Ag0 atoms [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208; valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208; isoleucine) have been synthesized for the first time. The Ag47 kernel consists of a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) and six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. They are superatoms with 1S21P61D10 configuration as revealed by DFT calculations. This work offers a facile method to obtain chiral nanoclusters by incorporating amino acids.







Abstract
Silver nanoclusters containing Ag0 atoms protected by amino acids were synthesized and characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208;valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208;isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC&#8801;CtBu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH4. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have T symmetry, and the Ag47 metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) surrounded with six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18&#8208;electron systems, suggesting they are superatomic clusters. The superatomic nature with a 1S21P61D10 configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.

The superatomic nature with a 1S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1P&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;1D&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural and Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Plant Serotonin N&#8208;Acetyltransferase Reveal an Acid/Base&#8208;Assisted Catalysis in Melatonin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT which exhibit a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold. MD simulations indicated a novel acid/base&#8208;assisted catalysis. The pH and temperature&#8208;depended activity were also shown. This is the first comprehensive study in plant N&#8208;acetyltransferase combining biochemical, structural, and theoretical analysis.







Abstract
Serotonin N&#8208;acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis. It mediates melatonin biosynthesis in plants by using serotonin and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine (5&#8208;MT), but little is known of its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of a SNAT from Oryza sativa through combined structural and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. We report the crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT. OsSNAT exhibits a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold not found in the known structures of arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) family. The key residues W188, D189, D226, N220, and Y233 located around the active pocket are important in catalysis, confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Combined with MD simulations, we hypothesize a novel plausible catalytic mechanism in which D226 and Y233 function as catalytic base and acid during the acetyl&#8208;transfer reaction.

         <title>pH Feedback Lifecycles Programmed by Enzymatic Logic Gates Using Common Foods as Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate with delay orchestrates a temporal pH feedback system: the YES gate lifts the system to a promoted state in seconds, and the NAND gate embedded with either invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase chain drives it back to ground state with programmable lifetime. The system is very robust and able to use common foods as fuels.







Abstract
Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have made large progress. However, systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by enzymatic logic gates. They are realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15&#8197;min to more than 1&#8197;day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Operating with all&#8208;food grade chemicals and coupling to self&#8208;regulating hydrogel, our system is quite robust to work in a complicated medium with unknown components and in a biocompatible fashion.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Probe for Enzyme Active&#8208;Site Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A genetically encoded two&#8208;dimensional infrared probe, N3Y, was developed for monitoring femtosecond to picosecond water dynamics and conformational flexibility of enzyme active sites. The addition of a low concentration of desaturating reagent decreased active&#8208;site water motion confinement, which is correlated with a decrease in enzyme activity.







Abstract
While two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active&#8208;site dynamics is limited due to the lack of site&#8208;specific 2D&#8208;IR probes. We demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D&#8208;IR probe, m&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine (N3Y) in the active&#8208;site of DddK, an iron&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active&#8208;site iron to FeIII, and the addition of denaturation reagents, result in significant decrease in enzyme activity and active&#8208;site water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles, including as general acids and bases, and electron transfer agents in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D&#8208;IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active&#8208;site motions at the fs&#8211;ps time scale direct reaction pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Cobalt(II) Catalysis: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is demonstrated via CoII catalysis. Broad substrate scope is achieved, yielding chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. A CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes is posited whereby steric substrate ligand effects promote enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of di&#8208; and trisubstituted unsaturated acids with noble metals is well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. We demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids via cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes. DFT calculations reveal that enantioselectivity may originate from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Diffraction Reveals a Hidden Novel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction can be used as a high&#8208;throughput technique for discovering new materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, especially when they are synthesized in a phase mixture.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF), denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO3&#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm&#8722;). With a composition of Zn3(mIm)5(OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

&lt;p&gt;Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction can be used as a high&#8208;throughput technique for discovering new materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, especially when they are synthesized in a phase mixture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF), denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). With a composition of Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(mIm)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of this new MOF and its conversion to an efficient electrocatalyst highlights the power of 3DED in developing new materials and their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Post&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly&#8208;Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two supramolecular polymers (SPs) derived from the same porphyrin precursor has been achieved via cross&#8208;coupling. Metal&#8208;coordinated SPs were easily decorated at both edges with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl via Heck reaction, while self&#8208;assembled chiral SPs underwent enantioselective cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl to acquire homochiral functional units.







Abstract
Although post&#8208;functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post&#8208;functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;20&#8208;bromophenyl porphyrin (Br&#8208;TPyP) via cross&#8208;coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder&#8208;shaped, Cu&#8208;coordinated SPs preformed from Br&#8208;TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br&#8208;TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self&#8208;assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross&#8208;coupling reaction with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on&#8208;surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br&#8208;TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. This Minireview examines how recent work on capillary microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication.







Abstract
Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. The goal of this Minireview is to examine how recent work on microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication. It specifically focuses on capillary microfluidics since these devices are self&#8208;powered, easy to use, and well established for diagnostics and drug monitoring. Considering that an improvement in medication adherence can have a much larger effect than the development of new medical treatments, it is long overdue for the research communities working in chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and material sciences to consider developing technologies to enhance medication adherence. For these reasons, this Minireview is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a quick starting point for researchers interested in joining this complex but intriguing and exciting field of research.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Counting Coupled to Rapid Amplification Enables Detection of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregates in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Parkinson's Disease Patients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new single&#8208;molecule method was established for the detection of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, a promising biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD). Individual ThT(+) aggregates were fingerprinted and amplified to improve detection limits by 3 orders of magnitude, compared to direct detection. A difference of behaviour was detected between PD and control samples.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and a promising biomarker for early detection and assessment of disease progression. The prospect of a molecular test for Parkinson's disease is materializing with the recent developments of detection methods based on amplification of synuclein seeds (e.g. RT&#8208;QuIC or PMCA). Here we adapted single&#8208;molecule counting methods for the detection of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), using a simple 3D printed microscope. Single&#8208;molecule methods enable to probe the early events in the amplification process used in RT&#8208;QuIC and a precise counting of ThT&#8208;positive aggregates. Importantly, the use of single&#8208;molecule counting also allows a refined characterization of the samples and fingerprinting of the protein aggregates present in CSF of patients. The fingerprinting of size and reactivity of individual aggregate shows a unique signature for each PD patients compared to controls and may provide new insights on synucleinopathies in the future.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alkylations of Ketones in a Combined Copper&#8211;Organocatalyst System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper and pyrrolidine dual catalyst system enables the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The key intermediates are catalytically generated &#945;&#8208;tertiary alkyl radical species and enamines.







Abstract
Herein, we report an efficient method for the tertiary alkylation of a ketone by using an &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compound as the tertiary alkyl source in a combined Cu&#8208;organocatalyst system. This dual catalyst system enables the addition of a tertiary alkyl radical to an enamine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the catalytically generated enamine is a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used to synthesize substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds containing quaternary carbons bearing various alkyl chains.

         <title>Tricycloquinazoline Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction is of critical importance. Good conductivity and abundant catalytic sites feature ideal electrocatalysts. Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D  c  &#8208;MOFs) are promising candidates in this regard as efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based multitopic catechol ligand was employed to coordinate with transition metal ions (Cu  2+  and Ni  2+  ), which therefore, formed 2D graphene&#8208;like porous sheets: M  3  (HHTQ)  2  (M = Cu, Ni; HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;Hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline). M  3  (HHTQ)  2  can be regarded as a single&#8208;atom catalyst where Cu or Ni centers are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal lattices.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction is of critical importance. Good conductivity and abundant catalytic sites feature ideal electrocatalysts. Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D  c  &#8208;MOFs) are promising candidates in this regard as efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based multitopic catechol ligand was employed to coordinate with transition metal ions (Cu  2+  and Ni  2+  ), which therefore, formed 2D graphene&#8208;like porous sheets: M  3  (HHTQ)  2  (M = Cu, Ni; HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;Hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline). M  3  (HHTQ)  2  can be regarded as a single&#8208;atom catalyst where Cu or Ni centers are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal lattices. Cu  3  (HHTQ)  2  exhibited superior catalytic activity towards CO  2  RR in which CH  3  OH is the sole product. The Faradic efficiency of CH  3  OH reached up to 53.6% at a small over&#8208;potential of &#8208;0.4 V vs RHE. Theoretical calculations and experimental results further indicated that, Cu  3  (HHTQ)  2  exhibited larger CO  2  adsorption energies and higher activities over the isostructural Ni  3  (HHTQ)  2  and the reported archetypical Cu  3  (HHTP)  2  .

         <title>Purification of propylene and ethylene by a robust metal&#8208;organic framework mediated by host&#8208;guest interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial purification of propylene and ethylene requires cryogenic distillation and selective hydrogenation over palladium catalysts to remove propane, ethane and/or trace amounts of acetylene. Here, we report the excellent separation of equimolar mixtures of propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, and of a 1/100 mixture of acetylene/ethylene by a highly robust microporous material, MFM&#8208;520, under dynamic conditions. In situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and analysis of adsorption thermodynamic parameters reveal that a series of synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions involving hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking interactions underpin the cooperative binding of alkenes within the pore. Notably, the optimal pore geometry of the material enables selective accommodation of acetylene. The practical potential of this porous material has been demonstrated by fabricating mixed&#8208;matrix membranes comprising MFM&#8208;520, Matrimid and PIM&#8208;1, and these exhibit not only a high permeability for propylene (~1984 Barrer), but also a separation factor of 7.8 for an equimolar mixture of propylene/propane at 298 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity for a Model Electrode: PrBaCo2O5+&#948;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of the perovskite lattice oxygen in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied in the PrBaCo2O5+&#948; family. The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in&#8208;depth characterizations such as neutron dif&#8208;fraction, O K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Vinylogous Addition Reactions Initiated by Meinwald Rearrangement of Vinyl Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Sc(III) complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate): A Simple Neutral Silane Acting as a Soft and Hard Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile synthesis and isolation of pristine silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate), Si(OTf)4, is reported, acting as the first neutral silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid suitable towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L = isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8211;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8211;X bonds (X = F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X = F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange.

Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L = isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8211;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8211;X bonds (X = F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X = F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange. Most notable, Si(OTf)4 allows a gentle oxydefluorination of mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding benzoylium species, which are stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Si(OTf)6] dianion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>(2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium: A Hexane&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Br/Na&#8208;Exchanges and Directed Metalations in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (    1    ) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (    2    ) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of    1    is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (    1    ) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteronuclear calcium&#8208;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)  n  ]  +  (n = 5 &#8208; 12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n = 10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)  4  fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)  6  fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)  6  ]  2+  dication and an [Fe(CO)  4  ]  &#8208;  anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8208;d dative bond in the [(CO)  6  Ca&#8208;Fe(CO)  4  ]  +  structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activation of DNA&#8208;Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is the central epigenetic mark of mammalian DNA and plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation. 5mC is written onto genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this process is an early event in carcinogenesis. However, studying 5mC functions is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal resolution in vivo. We report light&#8208;control of DNMT catalysis by genetically encoding a photocaged cysteine as catalytic residue. This enables translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light&#8208;decaging, and subsequent monitoring of de novo DNA methylation. We provide insights into how cancer&#8208;related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in vivo, and demonstrate local and tunable cytosine methylation by light&#8208;controlled DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator&#8208;like effector domain targeting pericentromeric satellite 3 DNA. We further study early events of transcriptome alterations upon DNMT&#8208;catalyzed cytosine methylation. Our approach offers unprecedented precision for studying the in vivo kinetics of DNMT&#8208;catalyzed cytosine methylation and subsequent downstream processes in chromatin.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiply&#8208;bonded lanthanide oxo groups are rare in coordination compounds and have not previously been reported for a surface termination of a lanthanide oxide. Here we report the observation of a Ce=O terminated ceria surface in a CeO  2  (111)&#8208;( [[EQUATION]] x [[EQUATION]] )R30&#176; reconstruction of ~3 nm thick ceria islands prepared on Pt(111). This is evidenced by scanning tunnelling microscopy, low energy electron diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Ce=O stretching frequency of 775 cm  &#8208;1  is observed in HREELS, compared with 766 cm  &#8208;1  calculated by DFT. The calculations also predict that the Ce=O bond is weak, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.85 eV. This could play an important role in the facile removal of lattice oxygen from CeO  2  , accompanied by the reduction of Ce  IV  to Ce  III  , which is a key attribute of ceria&#8208;based systems in connection with their unique catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam Chemicals from Biomass&#8208;Derived Triacetic Acid Lactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam chemicals have wide application, which are currently produced from fossil resource in industry. Production of this kind of chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is of great importance, but is challenging and the reported routes give low yield. Herein, we demonstrate the strategy to synthesize 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (  MP  ) and 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (  MPO  ) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (  TAL  ) that is produced microbially from glucose. In this route,  TAL  was firstly converted into 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (  HMPO  ) through facile aminolysis, subsequently  HMPO  was selectively transformed into  MP  or  MPO  over Ru catalysts supported on beta zeolite (Ru/BEA&#8208;X, X is the molar ratio of Si to Al)  via  the tandem reaction.  It was found that the yield of  MP  could reach 76.5% over Ru/BEA&#8208;60 in  t  &#8208;BuOH, and the yield of  MPO  could be 78.5% in dioxane. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru/BEA&#8208;60 was closely correlated with the cooperative effects between active metal and acidic zeolite with large pore geometries. The related reaction pathway was studied on the basis of control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr  3+  phosphor with emission peak at 965 nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217 nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892 nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+  ] for [Li+&#8211;In3+  ], which can be ascribed to the upshift of  4T2g  energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235 nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.</dc:description>

Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr  3+  phosphor with emission peak at 965 nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217 nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892 nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+  ] for [Li+&#8211;In3+  ], which can be ascribed to the upshift of  4T2g  energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235 nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total synthesis and structural characterization of caveolin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caveolin&#8208;1, which is an essential protein for caveola formation, was chemically synthesized. It is composed of 177 amino acid residues, triply palmitoylated at the C&#8208;terminus region and supposed to be inserted into the lipid bilayer forming a V&#8208;shaped structure in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The entire sequence was divided into 5 peptide segments and each of them was synthesized by the solid&#8208;phase method. To improve the solubility of the C&#8208;terminal region, the O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After the ligation by the thioester method and the introduction of the palmitoyl groups, all the protecting groups were removed and the isopeptide structures were converted to the native peptide bond. Finally, the obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into the bicelle, thus showing the success of the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis: Catalyzing CO2 conversion with carbon&#8208;based materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the differences between reactions driven by elevated temperature or electric potential remains challenging, largely due to materials incompatibilities between thermal catalytic and electrocatalytic environments. We show that Ni, N&#8208;doped carbon (NiPACN), an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2R), can also selectively catalyze thermal CO2 to CO via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) representing a direct analogy between catalytic phenomena across the two reaction environments. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that NiPACN likely facilitates RWGS on dispersed Ni sites in agreement with CO2R active site studies. Finally, we construct a generalized reaction driving&#8208;force that includes temperature and potential and suggest that NiPACN could facilitate faster kinetics in CO2R relative to RWGS due to lower intrinsic barriers. This report motivates further studies that quantitatively link catalytic phenomena across disparate reaction environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Surgery at Microporous MOF for Mesopore Generation and Renovation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical porous MOFs (HP&#8208;MOFs) present advantageous synergism of micro&#8208; and mesopore but challenging in synthetic control at molecular scale. Herein, we present the first example of reversible and controllable mesopore generation and renovation in a microporous MOF of HKUST&#8208;1 via synthetic manipulation at molecular scale. An ammonia&#8208;gas etching strategy is proposed to create mesopores in carboxylate&#8208;based microporous MOFs and thus produce HP&#8208;MOFs. Gas&#8208;phase etching ensures uniform mesopore formation inside the MOF crystals via plane&#8208;oriented cutting the carboxylate&#8208; metal&#160; bonds off without affecting the crystal size and morphology. The mesopore size is controlled by the etching temperature, while the mesopore volume could be tuned by adjusting etchant pressure. The generated mesopores could be renovated using MOF precursors solutions so that to achieve controllable mesopore generation/closure, and encapsulation of the adsorbed molecules. This work demonstrates a powerful protocol for precisely tailoring and tuning the properties of MOF materials at molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;Thebainone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;thebainone A, capitalized on an enantioselective C&#8208;C bond activation and a C&#8208;O bond cleavage reaction. The Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8216;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8217; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allows efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of the boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, synthesis of the morphine&#8208;alkaloid (&#8208;)&#8208;thebainone A has been completed with two complementary routes.</dc:description>

         <title>LiZn(OH)CO3: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Hydroxycarbonate Designed from Diamond&#8208;like Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve the well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesize the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal LiZn(OH)CO3. This compound simultaneously has wide band gap (&gt; 6.53 eV), strong second harmonic generation response (~3.2 &#215; KDP), and large birefringence (0.147@1064 nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&#955;PM &lt; 190 nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO3 are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.</dc:description>

         <title>Swelling&#8208;Induced Symmetry Breaking: A Versatile Approach to the Scalable Production of Colloidal Particles with a Janus Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus particles are widely sought for applications related to colloidal assembly, stabilization of emulsions, and development of active colloids, among others. Here we report a versatile route to the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled Janus particles by simply breaking the symmetry of spherical particles with swelling. When a polystyrene (PS) sphere covered by a rigid shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS, a gradually&#8208;increased pressure will be created inside the shell. If the pressure becomes high enough to poke a hole in the shell, the spherical symmetry will break while pushing out the swollen PS through the opening to generate a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components. One of the components is made of PS and its size is controlled by the extent of swelling. The other component is comprised of the rigid shell and remaining PS, with its overall diameter determined by the original PS sphere and the rigid shell. This solution&#8208;based route holds promises for the scalable production of complex Janus particles with a variety of compositions and in large quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ionic Organic Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and general method is presented herein for the  in situ  preparations of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active microcrystals with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor  g  lum  , high fluorescence quantum efficiency (  &#934;  FL  ), wide emission color tenability, and well&#8208;ordered morphology. The reactions of pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules  1  &#8208;  7  with chiral camphor sulfonic acid ((+/&#8722;)&#8208;CSA) gave crystalline microplates formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between the protonated pyridinium units and the sulfonic anions. The chiral information of CSA are effectively transferred to the microcrystals by hydrogen bonding to afford full&#8208;color CPL from deep&#8208;blue to red with  g  lum  in the order of 10  &#8722;2  and  &#934;  FL  up to 80%. Moreover, organic microcrystals with high&#8208;performance white CPL (  &#934;  FL  = 46%; |  g  lum  | = 0.025) are achieved via the light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer between blue and yellow emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Large UV Solar&#8208;Blind&#8208;Region Phase&#8208;Matchable Optical Nonlinearity&#160;and Anisotropy in a &#960;&#8209;Conjugated Cation&#8208;Containing Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide ultraviolet (UV) transparency, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, and sufficient optical birefringence for phase&#8208;matching (PM) at short SHG wavelengths are three vital prerequisites for practical UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, simultaneously optimizing these properties remains a major challenge, particularly for metal phosphates, due to their competing requirements. Herein, we report a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based UV NLO phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#183;3H2O (GPO) with a short UV cutoff edge. Remarkably, GPO is not only SHG active at 1064 nm (3.8 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm) and 532 nm (0.3 &#215;  &#946;  &#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532 nm), but it also possesses the largest birefringence (0.078 @ 546 nm) among phosphates with a band gap exceeding 6.0 eV. The PM SHG capability of GPO can extend to 250 nm, indicating GPO is a promising UV solar&#8208;blind NLO material. Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis demonstrate that the rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large SHG response and optical anisotropy can be attributed to the introduction of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations [C(NH2)3]+ and their favorable arrangement with [PO4]3&#8722; anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Norzoanthamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which was the major synthetic challenge for most of zoanthamine alkoids. (1) The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at C&#8208;9 and C&#8208;22 positions; (2) a Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C&#8208;12 via Csp3&#8208;Csp2 bond formation; (3) a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra&#8208;substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis&#8208;amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Copper&#8208;DNAzyme Nanohybrids for Dual&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great efforts of using DNAzyme for gene therapy, its clinical success is limited by the lack of simple in&#8208;vivo delivery systems and limited anticancer efficacy. Here, we develop a simple approach for the synthesis of hybrid nanostructures that exclusively consists of catalytic DNAzyme and Cu  2+  with ultra&#8208;high loading capacity. The engineered Cu&#8208;DNAzyme system allows to effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu  2+  into cancer cells for combinational catalytic therapy to fight against tumors. The released Cu  2+  can be reduced to Cu  +  by intracellular glutathione and then catalyze endogenous H2O2 to form cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), while the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme enables the catalytic cleavage of VEGFR2 mRNA and activates gene silencing for gene therapy. We demonstrate that the hybrid system can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity. Our work paves an extremely simple way to integrate DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy with CDT for the dual&#8208;catalytic tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplexes are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures essential for many cellular processes. Hybrid quadruplex&#8208;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains are challenging to study with conventional biophysical methods due to their structural complexity. Here, we introduce a novel method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source designed to investigate interactions between proximal DNA domains. Thermal denaturation experiments were planned to observe unfolding of multi&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide constructs derived from biologically relevant structures and to identify unfolding intermediates. Using the TCnESI MS, we observed changes in  T  m  and thermodynamic characteristics of proximal DNA domains depending on the number of domains, their position, and order in a single experiment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step sequence for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of exclusively alkyl&#8208;substituted acyclic allylic systems with a stereocenter in the allylic position is reported.

The silyl group steers the allylic displacement towards the formation of the vinylsilane regioisomer, and the resulting C(sp  2  )&#8211;Si bond serves as a linchpin for the installation of various C(sp  3  ) substituents in a subsequent step.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade to Benzoxepins by Using Vinyl&#8208;Substituted Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cascade (4+3) cyclocondensation of salicylaldehydes and vinylcyclopropanes is reported. A key feature of the reaction is the use of a phosphonate group as an acceptor moiety on the cyclopropane, exploiting its propensity to undergo olefination with aldehydes. Subsequent O&#8208;allylation allowed the formation of a range of substituted benzoxepines. Employing a novel chiral ligand, the products could be obtained in generally very good yield and with reasonable enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuneable control over organocatalytic activity through host guest chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways, a concept that is universal to controlling reactions networks by enzymatic catalysis in nature. However, synthetic catalysts with controllable activity are rare. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. However, most of these examples focus on transition metal catalysts and often have highly specialized designs to enable complex formation with the host molecules. Here, we present a host&#8208;guest chemistry based strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. Where CB[7] encapsulation in most cases results in catalyst inhibition, in one case we observe catalyst activation by binding to CB[7]. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and p  K  a measurements. In most of the catalysts or initiator regulated by CB[7], the addition of a stronger binding signal molecule liberates the catalysts and restores the catalytic activity to the original value. Moreover, we can instantaneously switch the catalytic activity during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and predict the reaction rate with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity, constituting a step towards the design and application of chemical reaction networks that respond to environmental triggers.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Pd2 Dual&#8208;atom Site Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs), like 100% atomic utilization efficiency and excellent selectivity. Herein, a supported Pd 2  DAC was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO 2  reduction reaction (CO 2  RR) for the first time. The as&#8208;obtained Pd 2  DAC exhibited superior CO 2  RR catalytic performance with 98.2% FE CO  at &#8208;0.85 V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd 1  SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the intrinsic reason for the superior activity of Pd 2  DAC toward CO 2  RR was the electron transfer between Pd atoms at the dimeric Pd sites. Thus, Pd 2  DAC possessed moderate adsorption strength of CO*, which was beneficial for CO production in CO 2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogs) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very facile synthetic methodology that relies on surprisingly easy trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association to plasma proteins and their performance for catalase&#8208;like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system designed to help chemists better understand and control manufacturing processes. PAT systems operate through the combination of analytical devices, reactor control elements, and mathematical models to ensure the quality of the final product  via  a quality by design (QbD) approach. The expansion of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry involves the development of PAT tools suitable for continuous operation and flow reactor environment. This requires innovative approaches to sampling and analysis from flowing media to maintain the integrity of the reactor content and the analyte of interest. The following review discusses examples of PAT tools implemented in flow chemistry for the preparation of small organic molecules, and applications of self&#8208;optimisation tools.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Counting and Superresolution Mapping of Tetraspanins on Exosomes using a Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitive Flow Technique and Transistor&#8208;like Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describes a method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100 exosome/s to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5 nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were fine adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes can be obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress being achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need working to approach the balance among the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost correlation. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl are developed via two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays synergistic roles in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge transfer rate in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. As results, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76%, representing the highest values among the reported fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte and Fully Infiltrated 3D Electrode for Integrated Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are very promising due to their enhanced safety and high energy density, but greatly plagued by the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes and large electrolyte&#8208;electrode interfacial resistance. Herein, we design a&#160;poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  ) and construct a model integrated TiO  2  /Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li  +  transport than common polymer electrolytes. Moreover, the integrated device simultaneously achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, presenting high performance close to that with liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7 V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin&#8208;film batteries (microbatteries), which also exhibits robust flexibility and brilliant safety under abuse tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumour Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the promise of sonodynamic process in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumor, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Herein, we report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO  2  @CaP) that not only reinvigorates the ROS generation but also dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca  2+  in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO  2  @CaP acts as the smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca  2+  ions to synergize with sonodynamic process in TME. Such a synergetic effect of TME&#8208;activated sonodynamic ROS generation and Ca  2+  release is revealed to substantially enhance immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenetic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO  2  @CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work thus paves the way to develop &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizer with tempospatial control over antitumor responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method enables the encapsulation of organic and inorganic phase change materials (PCMs) simultaneously has not been reported though a range of research has been dedicated to solving the leakage problems of PCMs during energy storage process. In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid silioxyl functional group containing polymer was synthesized and applied to encapsulate PCMs. Owing to the mild hypercrosslinking reaction conditions, which only require the addition of catalytic amount of aqueous alkali solution, renders it to be tolerance towards both organic and inorganic PCMs. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate PCMs encapsulation rate and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid polymers endows a unique self&#8208;cleaning property to the obtained phase change composite that it displays a good hydrophobicity to water droplets. More importantly, this novel PCMs encapsulation protocol displays good tolerance towards varies of nanoparticles, including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles and inorganic oxide nanoparticles, which enables an utmost 600% thermal conductivity enhancement and 93.7% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180 J/g without leakage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 Nanoclusters With Tailored Molecular and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9038-9044, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the synthesis and total structure determination of a novel Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 nanocluster, the first analogue of [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722;, are reported. The identical size as well as similar core&#8208; and different surface&#8208;structures of these two nanoclusters enable the study of the structural effect on the optical and photophysical properties. The novel surface structure plays a crucial role in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence.







Abstract
Although atomically precise metalloid nanoclusters (NCs) of identical size with distinctly different molecular structures are highly desirable to understand the structural effects on the optical and photophysical properties, their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, we employed phosphine and thiol capping ligands featuring appropriate steric effects and synthesized a charge&#8208;neutral Ag NC with the formula Ag44(EBT)26(TPP)4 (EBT: 2&#8208;ethylbenzenethiolate; TPP: triphenylphosphine). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure reveals that this NC has a hollow metal core of Ag12@Ag20 and a metal&#8211;ligand shell of Ag12(EBT)26(TPP)4. The presence of mixed ligands and long V&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;ligand motifs on this NC has resulted in an enhancement of the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence quantum yield by &gt;25&#8208;fold compared to an all&#8208;thiolate&#8208;stabilized anionic [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; NC (SR: thiolate). Time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional calculations show that our Ag44 NC is an 18&#8208;electron superatom with a modulated electronic structure as compared to the [Ag44(SR)30]4&#8722; anion, significantly influencing its optical properties.

Time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional calculations show that our Ag&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; NC is an 18&#8208;electron superatom with a modulated electronic structure as compared to the [Ag&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion, significantly influencing its optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Intramolecular Wittig Reaction Enables Efficient Synthesis of Endofullerenes Including Ne@C60, 3He@C60, and HD@C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8960-8966, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state filling of a stable phosphorus ylid open&#8208;cage fullerene is followed by heating, inducing an in&#8197;situ intramolecular Wittig reaction to reduce the size of the cage opening and trapping a single gas atom or molecule inside. Expensive gases can be compressed to high pressure, leading to high incorporation of the endohedral species. Cage closure steps allow preparation of gram&#8208;scale endohedral fullerenes including 3He@C60, HD@C60, and Ne@C60.







Abstract
An open&#8208;cage fullerene incorporating phosphorous ylid and carbonyl group moieties on the rim of the orifice can be filled with gases (H2, He, Ne) in the solid state, and the cage opening then contracted in&#8197;situ by raising the temperature to complete an intramolecular Wittig reaction, trapping the atom or molecule inside. Known transformations complete conversion of the product fullerene to C60 containing the endohedral species. As well as providing an improved synthesis of large quantities of 4He@C60, H2@C60, and D2@C60, the method allows the efficient incorporation of expensive gases such as HD and 3He, to prepare HD@C60 and 3He@C60. The method also enables the first synthesis of Ne@C60 by molecular surgery, and its characterization by crystallography and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8896-8904, April 12, 2021. </description>

Highly selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. The chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds was investigated, revealing a high selectivity for the most symmetric cage compounds, for which an explanation is presented. The properties of the isolated enantiopure and meso cage compounds were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas sorption measurements showing high porosities and selectivities.







Abstract
Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a meso cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of din=3.3&#8211;3.5&#8197;nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 after desolvation.

         <title>Free&#8208;Radical Membrane Protein Footprinting by Photolysis of Perfluoroisopropyl Iodide Partitioned to Detergent Micelle by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8867-8873, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;mediated free&#8208;radical footprinting of an integral membrane protein (IMP) is described. Compared to canonical footprinting, the approach exploits tip sonication to ensure efficient transport of a highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl iodide to footprint transmembrane domains. This approach, which is amenable to native IMP structures, yields 100&#8201;% coverage for tyrosine, and it is compatible with standard proteomic mass spectrometric analysis.







Abstract
A free&#8208;radical footprinting approach is described for integral membrane protein (IMP) that extends, significantly, the &#8220;fast photochemical oxidation of proteins&#8221; (FPOP) platform. This new approach exploits highly hydrophobic perfluoroisopropyl iodide (PFIPI) together with tip sonication to ensure efficient transport into the micelle interior, allowing laser dissociation and footprinting of the transmembrane domains. In contrast to water soluble footprinters, PFIPI footprints both the hydrophobic intramembrane and the hydrophilic extramembrane domains of the IMP vitamin&#8197;K epoxide reductase (VKOR). The footprinting is fast, giving high coverage for Tyr (100&#8201;%) and Trp. The incorporation of the reagent with sonication does not significantly affect VKOR's enzymatic function, and tyrosine iodination does not compromise protease digestion and the subsequent analysis. The locations for the modifications are largely consistent with the corresponding solvent accessibilities, recommending this approach for future membrane protein footprinting.

         <title>Surface Functionalization of Black Phosphorus with Nitrenes: Identification of P=N Bonds by Using Isotopic Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9127-9134, April 12, 2021. </description>

A mild, surface&#8208;specific method for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets is developed using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of techniques can be used to investigate the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets.







Abstract
Surface functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional crystals is a key path to tuning their intrinsic physical and chemical properties. However, synthetic protocols and experimental strategies to directly probe chemical bonding in modified surfaces are scarce. Introduced herein is a mild, surface&#8208;specific protocol for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of characterization techniques are employed to investigate in detail the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets, including vibrational, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. To directly probe the functional groups introduced on the surface, R fragments were selected such that in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy, 15N&#8208;labeling experiments, and DFT methods, diagnostic P=N vibrational modes indicative of iminophosphorane units on the nanosheet surface could be conclusively identified.

A robust porous biological HOF with bpy docking groups has been designed, prepared, and post&#8208;modified to precisely load Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl as molecular catalyst on the basis of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking metal&#8208;free G&#8208;quadruplex moieties. With the help of the sensitizer, the post&#8208;functionalized HOF promotes efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion in a heterogeneous system under the visible&#8208;light irradation.







Abstract
A robust 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)5Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study on HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re confirms the covalent attachment of Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl segments to this HOF. Robust and recycled HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re bearing photocatalytic Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl centers displays good heterogeneous catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide photoreduction in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 and triisopropanolamine in CH3CN under visible&#8208;light irradiation, with both high CO production rate of 1448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 93&#8201;%. Under the same conditions, the experimental turnover number of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re (50) is about 8 times as that of the homogeneous control Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl. The sustainably regenerated HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re via crystallization and post&#8208;modification processes shows recovered photocatalytic performance.

         <title>&#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221;: Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput in Vitro Screening of NAD(H) Dehydrogenases Using Bead Display and Flow Cytometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9015-9021, April 12, 2021. </description>

A detection system was devised to screen dehydrogenase enzymes (DH) at ultrahigh&#8208;throughput in in vitro droplet compartments. An NAD(H) analogue and a DH DNA library were co&#8208;immobilised on beads. Water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets containing cell&#8208;free expression mix and substrate allow compartmentalised protein production and catalysis. A fluorescent sensor of NAD(H) redox state was loaded onto beads, allowing bulk sorting of 2&#215;104 DH variants in a day by flow cytometry.







Abstract
NAD(H)&#8208;utiliing enzymes have been the subject of directed evolution campaigns to improve their function. To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases. Microbeads (1.5 million per sample) carrying both variant DNA and an immobilised analogue of NAD+ were compartmentalised in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets, together with cell&#8208;free expression mixture and enzyme substrate, resulting in the recording of the phenotype on each bead. The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD+:NADH ratio. Integration of this &#8220;NAD&#8208;display&#8221; approach with our previously described Split &amp; Mix (SpliMLiB) method for generating large site&#8208;saturation libraries allowed straightforward screening of fully balanced site saturation libraries of formate dehydrogenase, with diversities of 2&#215;104. Based on modular design principles of synthetic biology NAD&#8208;display offers access to sophisticated in vitro selections, avoiding complex technology platforms.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9099-9105, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral and hexahedral coordination cages with one or two missing linkers, as well as regular trigonal prismatic cages, are synthesized by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of lanthanide(III) ions. The defective cages, especially the hexahedral cage, are conformationally flexible and adapt its structure to accommodate various guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals that are not accessible to the non&#8208;defective cage.







Abstract
We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands L1&#8211;L3 with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which L3 has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of L1 and L2 with lanthanides afford the irregular Ln8(L1)10 hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln4(L2)5 tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)2 and Ln(pcam)3. In contrast, complex of L3 produces the regular twisted Ln6(L3)9 trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)3 vertices. The defective cage has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals.

         <title>High&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Membrane with Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity and Irradiation Stability for Krypton/Xenon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9032-9037, April 12, 2021. </description>

High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes show ultra&#8208;high Kr/Xe selectivity and superior hydrothermal stability. Together with their irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes can pave the way to enrich radioactive 85Kr from xenon for a notable decrease in the volatile nuclear waste volume.







Abstract
Capture and storage of the long&#8208;lived 85Kr is an efficient approach to mitigate the emission of volatile radionuclides from the spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities. However, it is challenging to separate krypton (Kr) from xenon (Xe) because of the chemical inertness and similar physical properties. Herein we prepared high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes with ultra&#8208;high selectivity and irradiation stability for Kr/Xe separation. The suitable aperture size and rigid framework endures the membrane a strong size&#8208;exclusion effect. The ultrahigh selectivity of 51&#8211;152 together with the Kr permeance of 0.7&#8211;1.3&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 of high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes far surpass the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric membranes. The membrane is among the most stable polycrystalline membranes for separation of humid Kr/Xe mixtures. Together with the excellent irradiation stability, high&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes pave the way to separate radioactive Kr from Xe for a notable reduction of the volatile nuclear waste storage volume.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Remote Activation of Ferroptosis in Target Tumor Cells through a Photothermally Responsive Iron&#8208;Chelated Biopolymer Nanoplatform</title>

Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death and holds promise for tumor inhibition. However, it is difficult to remotely control the initiation and execution of ferroptosis in specific sites. This study reports a biocompatible and biodegradable biopolymeric nanoplatform for tumor&#8208;targeted ferroptosis therapy, of which the pro&#8208;ferroptotic activities could be activated in an on&#8208;demand manner using near&#8208;infrared light as the triggering signal.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death that shows promise for tumor treatment. Most current ferroptosis tumor therapies are based on the intrinsic pathological features of the malignancies, and it would be of clinical significance to develop ferroptosis&#8208;inducing strategies with improved tumor specificity and modulability. Here we report a polydopamine&#8208;based nanoplatform (FeIIPDA@LAP&#8208;PEG&#8208;cRGD) for the efficient loading of Fe2+ and &#946;&#8208;lapachone (LAP), which could readily initiate ferroptosis in tumor cells upon treatment with near&#8208;infrared light. PDA nanostructures could generate mild hyperthermia under NIR irritation and trigger the release of the ferroptosis&#8208;inducing Fe2+ ions. The NIR&#8208;actuated photothermal effect would also activate cellular heat shock response and upregulate the downstream NQO1 via HSP70/NQO1 axis to facilitate bioreduction of the concurrently released &#946;&#8208;lapachone and enhance intracellular H2O2 formation to promote the Fe2+&#8208;mediated lipid peroxidation.

         <title>Activation of Pyroptosis by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring AIE Photosensitizer Design: New Prospect for Photodynamic Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9093-9098, April 12, 2021. </description>

Membrane anchoring photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were designed for cancer cell ablation via photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis.







Abstract
Pyroptosis as a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death is a powerful tool to fight against cancer. However, pyroptosis is usually activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, which limits its anti&#8208;tumor applications due to drug resistance and severe side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that membrane targeting photosensitizers can induce pyroptosis for cancer cell ablation with noninvasiveness and low side effects. A series of membrane anchoring photosensitizers (TBD&#8208;R PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics were prepared through conjugation of TBD and phenyl ring with cationic chains. Upon light irradiation, cytotoxic ROS were produced in situ, resulting in direct membrane damage and superior cancer cell ablation. Detailed study revealed that pyroptosis gradually became the dominant cell death pathway along with the increase of TBD&#8208;R PSs membrane anchoring capability. This study offers a photo&#8208;activated pyroptosis&#8208;based intervention strategy for cancer cell ablation.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction Kinetics of Nitrogen to Ammonia via Tuning Electron Distribution of Single&#8208;Atomic Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9078-9085, April 12, 2021. </description>

A single iron atom catalyst composed of atomically&#8208;dispersed iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped carbon matrix with an inverse opal structure is developed to accelerate nitrogen reduction reaction kinetics for efficient conversion of N2 into NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) plays a vital role for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, the NRR kinetics is still limited by the sluggish hydrogenation process on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a hybrid catalyst with atomic iron sites anchored on a N,O&#8208;doped porous carbon (FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C) matrix of an inverse opal structure, leading to a remarkably high NH3 yield rate of 31.9&#8197;&#956;g
&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faradaic efficiency of 11.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V for NRR electrocatalysis, outperformed almost all previously reported atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the observed high NRR catalytic activity for the FeSA&#8208;NO&#8208;C catalyst stemmed mainly from the optimized charge&#8208;transfer between the adjacent O and Fe atoms homogenously distributed on the porous carbon support, which could not only significantly facilitate the transportation of N2 and ions but also effectively decrease the binding energy between the isolated Fe atom and *N2 intermediate and the thermodynamic Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (*N2 &#8594; *NNH).

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8851-8858, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively.







Abstract
Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin&#8197;A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin&#8197;A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.

In a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type FeNx/C catalyst, Fe&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles promote the efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 for the highly selective oxidation of methane to formic acid. The reaction mechanism at the active sites has been studied.







Abstract
H2O2 as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely used in the chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into .OH (stronger oxidant), but this reaction always competes with O2 generation resulting in H2O2 waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;Nx sites and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;Nx in the low spin state provides the active site for .OH generation. Fe/Fe3C, in particular Fe3C, promotes Fe&#8208;Nx sites for the homolytic cleavages of H2O2 into .OH, but Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe0 as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O2 generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O2 generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H2O2 in the chemical industry.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Donating Character of MoS2 in Covalently Linked Hybrids Featuring Perylenediimide</title>

The well&#8208;known electron acceptor perylenediimide (PDI) is covalently attached to semiconducting MoS2, thus exposing the MoS2 material's electron donating potential in the novel MoS2&#8211;PDI hybrid.







Abstract
The covalent functionalization of MoS2 with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS2&#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS2 interfacing organic photoactive species has shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS2 to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS2&#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS2.+&#8208;PDI.&#8722; charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS2, as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Two Cryptic Self&#8208;Resistance Mechanisms in Streptomyces tenebrarius Reveal Insights into the Biosynthesis of Apramycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8990-8996, April 12, 2021. </description>

Two cryptic self&#8208;resistance mechanisms involving C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation were discovered in Streptomyces tenebrarius to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity during apramycin biosynthesis. Characterization of the corresponding enzymes revealed the apramycin's assembly line at the pseudotrisaccharide stage.







Abstract
Apramycin is a clinically promising aminoglycoside antibiotic (AGA). To date, mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and self&#8208;resistance of apramycin remain largely unknown. Here we report that apramycin biosynthesis proceeds through unexpected phosphorylation, deacetylation, and dephosphorylation steps, in which a novel aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (AprU), a putative creatinine amidohydrolase (AprP), and an alkaline phosphatase (AprZ) are involved. Biochemical characterization revealed that AprU specifically phosphorylates 5&#8208;OH of a pseudotrisaccharide intermediate, whose N&#8208;7&#8242; acetyl group is subsequently hydrolyzed by AprP. AprZ is located extracellularly where it removes the phosphate group from a pseudotetrasaccharide intermediate, leading to the maturation of apramycin. Intriguingly, 7&#8242;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylated and 5&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylated apramycin that were accumulated in &#916;aprU and &#916;aprZ respectively exhibited significantly reduced antibacterial activities, implying Streptomyces tenebrarius employs C&#8208;5 phosphorylation and N&#8208;7&#8242; acetylation as two strategies to avoid auto&#8208;toxicity. Significantly, this study provides insight into the design of new generation AGAs to circumvent the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant pathogens.

Highly substituted polyalkyl furans can be synthesized using sequential Michael&#8211;Heck reactions between functionalized (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo allylic alcohols and activated alkynes. This method provides facile access to tetraalkyl furans containing a C2&#8208;carboxyalkyl chain, which is readily functionalized to enable the total syntheses of several classes of bioactive furans, including furanoterpenes, polyketides, and furan fatty acids.







Abstract
Polyalkyl furans are widespread in nature, often performing important biological roles. Despite a plethora of methods for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted furans, the construction of tetraalkyl furans remains non&#8208;trivial. The prevalence of alkyl groups in bioactive furan natural products, combined with the desirable bioactivities of tetraalkyl furans, calls for a general synthetic protocol for polyalkyl furans. This paper describes a Michael&#8211;Heck approach, using sequential phosphine&#8208;palladium catalysis, for the preparation of various polyalkyl furans from readily available precursors. The versatility of this method is illustrated by the total syntheses of nine distinct polyalkylated furan natural products belonging to different classes, namely the furanoterpenes rosefuran, sesquirosefuran, and mikanifuran; the marine natural products plakorsins&#8197;A, B, and D and plakorsin&#8197;D methyl ester; and the furan fatty acids 3D5 and hydromumiamicin.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8839-8850, April 12, 2021. </description>

Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.







Abstract
RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1&#8197;cm&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object.

     alt="Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid RAFT 3D Printing: Photoinduced RAFT polymerization is applied to 3D printing, resulting in rapid prints with a broad window of operation. High resolution surface patterning from the 3D printed objects is readily achieved by reactivation of dormant RAFT functionalities in the polymeric material.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1&#8197;cm&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilization of Polynitrogen Anions in Tantalum&#8211;Nitrogen Compounds at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9003-9008, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct reaction between nitrogen and tantalum at approximately 100&#8197;GPa results in the energetic nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds TaN4 and TaN5, which feature N4 chains and unprecedented branched single&#8208;bonded polymeric nitrogen chains in the crystal structures, respectively. TaN5 possesses an extraordinary volumetric energy density of 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, exceeding well&#8208;known high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.







Abstract
The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8722;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN5 via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at circa 100&#8197;GPa. TaN5 is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N55&#8722;]&#8734;. Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8211;N compounds: TaN4 with finite N44&#8722; chains and the incommensurately modulated compound TaN2&#8722;x, which is recoverable at ambient conditions.

         <title>Selectively Upgrading Lignin Derivatives to Carboxylates through Electrochemical Oxidative C(OH)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage by a Mn&#8208;Doped Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8976-8982, April 12, 2021. </description>

An electrochemical strategy has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds using a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst under mild conditions. Preliminary studies demonstrate its application in upgrading lignin&#8208;derived products with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, electrorefining them into valuable oxygenates, such as benzoate and adipate.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.

         <title>Enhanced Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Self&#8208;Photosensitized Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9055-9062, April 12, 2021. </description>

Novel biohybrid systems are created for light&#8208;driven H2 production by using non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms self&#8208;photosensitized with CdS nanoparticles. An outstanding biohybrid system using D. desulfuricans displays high H2 production activity, high stability and a remarkable solar efficiency.







Abstract
Storage of solar energy as hydrogen provides a platform towards decarbonizing our economy. One emerging strategy for the production of solar fuels is to use photocatalytic biohybrid systems that combine the high catalytic activity of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms with the high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency of metal semiconductor nanoparticles. However, few such systems have been tested for H2 production. We investigated light&#8208;driven H2 production by three novel organisms, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Citrobacter freundii, and Shewanella oneidensis, self&#8208;photosensitized with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, and compared their performance to Escherichia coli. All biohybrid systems produced H2 from light, with D. desulfuricans&#8208;CdS demonstrating the best activity overall and outperforming the other microbial systems even in the absence of a mediator. With this system, H2 was continuously produced for more than 10&#8197;days with a specific rate of 36&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gdcw&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. High apparent quantum yields of 23&#8201;% and 4&#8201;% were obtained, with and without methyl viologen, respectively, exceeding values previously reported.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Room Temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9106-9113, April 12, 2021. </description>

Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics.







Abstract
Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, the crystal structure and transport properties of Cu4TiSe4 are reported. Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu4TiSe4 could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.

Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TiSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TiSe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8882-8888, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8197;situ technique is presented that closes the gap between catalyst degradation studies in real devices and fundamental electrochemical analyses. The method involves direct measurement of platinum dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and through Nafion membranes. The impact of catalyst loading and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface on platinum dissolution, as well as transport behavior of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes, are investigated.







Abstract
Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights have been gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8197;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes were evaluated directly. We observed that 1)&#8197;specific Pt dissolution increased significantly with decreasing Pt loading, 2)&#8197;in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments was considerably lower, and 3)&#8197;by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution was reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.

         <title>Cys&#8211;Cys and Cys&#8211;Lys Stapling of Unprotected Peptides Enabled by Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9022-9031, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling are reported. Efficient and selective stapling on non&#8208;protected peptides was observed, and post&#8208;stapling modification could be easily achieved using reactive esters or cycloaddition on the thioalkynes formed on the cysteine residue. One stapled peptide displayed both enhanced helicity and binding to the MDM2 protein.







Abstract
Easy access to a wide range of structurally diverse stapled peptides is crucial for the development of inhibitors of protein&#8208;protein interactions. Herein, we report bis&#8208;functional hypervalent iodine reagents for two&#8208;component cysteine&#8208;cysteine and cysteine&#8208;lysine stapling yielding structurally diverse thioalkyne linkers. This stapling method works with unprotected natural amino acid residues and does not require pre&#8208;functionalization or metal catalysis. The products are stable to purification and isolation. Post&#8208;stapling modification can be accessed via amidation of an activated ester, or via cycloaddition onto the formed thioalkyne group. Increased helicity and binding affinity to MDM2 was obtained for a i,i+7 stapled peptide.

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#8197;Products at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9135-9141, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#8208;Cu gas diffusion electrode (GDE) system was developed for highly selective CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at high relevant current densities by mitigating the flooding problem and tuning the three&#8208;phase boundary. Anodic protection by sacrificial Zn&#8197;nanosheets remarkably improved the long&#8208;term stability for CO2 electroreduction at high current densities.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stability under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were developed for highly selective and stable CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79&#8201;% for C2+&#8197;products formation at a current density of &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a potential of &#8722;0.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C2+ formation was substantially improved by incorporating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu+ species under CO2 reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which lead to the excellent conversion of CO2 to C2+ products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.

         <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8923-8931, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating organelle&#8208;specific targeting and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation with DNA sensor technology, precise imaging of a specific enzyme in a chosen organelle (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus) was possible (see picture). The spatiotemporal control enabled imaging of enzyme translocation at subcellular resolution in response to oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Understanding of the functions of enzymes in diverse cellular processes is important, but the design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8197;1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria or nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxidative stress in live cells.

         <title>(Aza)Acenes Share the C2 Bridge with (Anti)Aromatic Macrocycles: Local vs. Global Delocalization Paths</title>

Global switch for local effect: The linear fusion of (aza)acene and a redox switchable macrocycle (i.e. triphyrin(2.1.1)) gives a set of fused systems merging two &#960;&#8208;conjugated clouds. A competition between local and global effects can be distinguished as documented in spectroscopic properties with a domination of (aza)acene diatropic current obtained after a redox switching within the macrocyclic flank.







Abstract
A strong conjugation present in fused systems plays a crucial role in tuning of the properties that would be showing a dependence on the efficiency of &#960;&#8208;electrons coupling. The &#960;&#8208;cloud available in the final structure can be drastically influenced by a side&#8208; or a linear fusion of unsaturated and conjugated hydrocarbons. The linear welding of naphthalene/anthracene or quinoxaline/benzo[g]quinoxaline with triphyrin(2.1.1) gives structures where the competition between local and global delocalization is distinguished. The aromatic character observed in skeletons strongly depends on the oxidation state of the macrocyclic flanking and is either extended over the whole system or kept as a composition of local currents (diatropic and paratropic) of incorporated units. The hybrid systems show the properties derived from the &#960;&#8208;conjugations that interlace one another but also show a significant independence of (aza)acene subunits reflected in the observed spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Macrocyclic Arenes&#8208;Based Conjugated Macrocycle Polymers for Highly Selective CO2 Capture and Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8967-8975, April 12, 2021. </description>

Four catcher&#8208;type conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) have been designed and synthesized successfully, exhibiting interesting application in CO2 and I2 uptake. The CMP&#8208;2 is able to capture CO2 with excellent selectivity and the CMP&#8208;4 is capable of adsorbing iodine with outstanding capacity.







Abstract
Incorporating synthetic macrocycles with unique structures and distinct conformations into conjugated macrocycle polymers (CMPs) can endow the resulting materials with great potentials in gas uptake and pollutant adsorption. Here, four CMPs (CMP&#8208;n, n=1&#8211;4) capable of reversibly capturing iodine and efficiently separating carbon dioxide are constructed from per&#8208;triflate functionalized leaning tower[6]arene (LT6&#8208;OTf) and [2]biphenyl&#8208;extended pillar[6]arene (BpP6&#8208;OTf) via Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Intriguingly, owing to the appropriate cavity size of LT6&#8208;OTf and the numerous aromatic rings in the framework, the newly designed CMP&#8208;4 possesses an outstanding I2 affinity with a large uptake capacity of 208&#8197;wt&#8201;% in vapor and a great removal efficiency of 94&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. To our surprise, with no capacity to accommodate nitrogen, CMP&#8208;2 constructed from BpP6&#8208;OTf is able to specifically capture carbon dioxide at ambient conditions.

The first catalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones, containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups, is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution. Catalyzed by a combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2, this reaction delivers cyclopenta[b]indolones, containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, with up to 98.5:1.5 e.r.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective Fischer indolization of prochiral diketones containing enantiotopic carbonyl groups is developed and shown to proceed through dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). Catalyzed by the combination of a spirocyclic chiral phosphoric acid and ZnCl2 (Lewis acid assisted Br&#248;nsted acid), this direct approach combines 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones with N&#8208;protected phenylhydrazines to furnish cyclopenta[b]indole derivatives containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>An Unexpected Cubic Symmetry in Group&#8197;IV Alloys Prepared Using Pressure and Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9009-9014, April 12, 2021. </description>

New materials can be created without the need to follow conventional criteria and routes to synthesis. We demonstrate this for Ge&#8211;Sn, a system actively investigated for optoelectronic applications to overcome conventional cubic Si's deficiencies. Ge and Sn are however unreactive in the bulk, but we remove reactivity barriers and form a different structure, a simple new cubic solid solution.







Abstract
The cubic diamond (Fd
m) group IVA element Si has been the material driver of the electronics industry since its inception. We report synthesis of a new cubic (Im
m) group IVA material, a GeSn solid solution, upon heating Ge and Sn at pressures from 13 to 28&#8197;GPa using double&#8208;sided diamond anvil laser&#8208;heating and large volume press methods. Both methods were coupled with in situ angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization. The new material substantially enriches the seminal group IVA alloy materials landscape by introducing an eightfold coordinated cubic symmetry, which markedly expands on the conventional tetrahedrally coordinated cubic one. This cubic solid solution is formed, despite Ge never adopting the Im
m symmetry, melting inhibiting subsequent Im
m formation and reactant Ge and Sn having unlike crystal structures and atomic radii at all these pressures. This is hence achieved without adherence to conventional formation criteria and routes to synthesis. This advance creates fertile avenues for new materials development.

         <title>Dynamic Stereoselection of Peptide Helicates and Their Selective Labeling of DNA Replication Foci in Cells**

Artificial bipyridine&#8208;containing peptide ligands encode in their sequence the stereoselective folding into chiral three&#8208;stranded FeII or CoII peptide helicates and as kinetically inert dinuclear CoIII complexes by in&#8208;situ oxidation. These peptide helicates selectively label DNA replication foci in functional cells.







Abstract
Although largely overlooked in peptide engineering, coordination chemistry offers a new set of interactions that opens unexplored design opportunities for developing complex molecular structures. In this context, we report new artificial peptide ligands that fold into chiral helicates in the presence of labile metal ions such as FeII and CoII. Heterochiral &#946;&#8208;turn&#8208;promoting sequences encode the stereoselective folding of the peptide ligands and define the physicochemical properties of their corresponding metal complexes. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods allowed us to identify and determine the structure of two isochiral &#923;&#923;&#8208;helicates, folded as topological isomers. Finally, in addition to the in&#8208;vitro characterization of their selective binding to DNA three&#8208;way junctions, cell&#8208;microscopy experiments demonstrated that a rhodamine&#8208;labeled FeII helicate was internalized and selectively stains DNA replication factories in functional cells.

         <title>Constructing Electron Levers in Perovskite Nanocrystals to Regulate the Local Electron Density for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8905-8912, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy is proposed by constructing Mn&#8208;doped BiFeO3 nanocrystals with a Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond lever, which can specifically increase the local electron density of the Fe reaction centre to improve the kinetics of chemodynamic therapy. This method is promising in future research on the quantitative regulation of electron density and on&#8208;demand chemical reactivity adjustment.







Abstract
The local electron density of an atom is one key factor that determines its chemical properties. Regulating electron density can promote the atom's reactivity and so reduce the reaction activation energy, which is highly desired in many chemical applications. Herein, we report an intra&#8208;crystalline electron lever strategy, which can regulate the electron density of reaction centre atoms via manipulating ambient lattice states, for Fenton activity improvement. Typically, with the assistance of ultrasound, the Mn4+&#8722;O&#8722;Fe3+ bond in BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3 perovskite nanocrystals can drive valence electrons and free electrons to accumulate on Fe atoms by a polarization electric field originated from the designed lattice strain. The increase of electron density significantly improves the catalytic activity of Fe, decreasing the activation energy of BiFe0.97Mn0.03O3&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction by 52.55&#8201;%, and increasing the .OH yield by 9.21&#8208;fold. This study provides a new way to understand the sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry, and the increased .OH production enables a highly effective chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;Based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8948-8959, April 12, 2021. </description>

Inspired by reversible ice adhesion, a reversible ionic crystal (IC) based gel adhesive was prepared, which showed superstrong and reversible adhesion due to the phase transition of ICs. In addition, the reversible adhesion can be adjusted by heating and light, and be effectively monitored by resistance and capacitance.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the &#8220;adhesive&#8221; state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82&#8197;MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state 1H&#8197;NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling. This study proposed the new design of removable adhesives, which can be used in dynamic and complex environments.

         <title>Quantifying the Likelihood of Structural Models through a Dynamically Enhanced Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8913-8922, April 12, 2021. </description>

Structurally characterizing new and poorly crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks is highly challenging. The dynamic protocol of this work overcomes this challenge through a systematic likelihood ordering based on intuitive heuristics and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. It succeeds in unambiguously identifying a material's atomic&#8208;level structure, accounting for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experiments.







Abstract
Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein, a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroacylation Involving Alkene Isomerization for the Construction of C3&#8208;Chirogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8997-9002, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation of 3&#8208;enals involving alkene isomerization was developed for the efficient construction of C3&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A new transformation pattern for enantioselective intramolecular hydroacylation has been developed involving an alkene isomerization strategy. Proceeding through a five&#8208;membered rhodacycle intermediate, 3&#8208;enals were converted to C3&#8208; or C3,C5&#8208;chirogenic cyclopentanones with satisfactory yields, diastereoselectivities, and enantioselectivities. A catalytic cycle has been theoretically calculated and the origin of the stereoselection is rationally explained.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Bio&#8208;oligomer Polydispersity in Plant Tissues by Laser Desorption Ionization from Silicon Nanopost Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
Simultaneous chemical analysis and spatial mapping of homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock in biological tissues are challenging using conventional MS imaging. Here, the spatial and size distributions for oligomers from polyhydroxybutyrate, polysaccharide, and polyglutamic acid are profiled in rhizobia&#8208;infected soybean root nodules by MS imaging using nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays and MALDI.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables simultaneous spatial mapping for diverse molecules in biological tissues. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been a mainstream MSI method for a wide range of biomolecules. However, MALDI&#8208;MSI of biological homopolymers used for energy storage and molecular feedstock is limited by, e.g., preferential ionization for certain molecular classes. Matrix&#8208;free nanophotonic ionization from silicon nanopost arrays (NAPAs) is an emerging laser desorption ionization (LDI) platform with ultra&#8208;trace sensitivity and molecular imaging capabilities. Here, we show complementary analysis and MSI of polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB), polyglutamic acid (PGA), and polysaccharide oligomers in soybean root nodule sections by NAPA&#8208;LDI and MALDI. For PHB, number and weight average molar mass, polydispersity, and oligomer size distributions across the tissue section and in regions of interest were characterized by NAPA&#8208;LDI&#8208;MSI.

Here, we show complementary analysis and MSI of polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB), polyglutamic acid (PGA), and polysaccharide oligomers in soybean root nodule sections by NAPA&#8208;LDI and MALDI. For PHB, number and weight average molar mass, polydispersity, and oligomer size distributions across the tissue section and in regions of interest were characterized by NAPA&#8208;LDI&#8208;MSI.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bio&#8208;adhesive Nanoporous Module: Toward Autonomous Gating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8932-8937, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous covalent organic framework (GlueCOF) carrying guanidinium ion pendants has been developed that can accommodate guests and bind to biopolymers. The strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature of GlueCOF was used to noncovalently bind to calmodulin (CaM), which acted as a gating component for the guest&#8208;loaded 1D nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;guest). The conformational change of the CaM gate upon selective binding with Ca2+ enabled the release of guest molecules.







Abstract
Here we report a bio&#8208;adhesive porous organic module (GlueCOF) composed of hexagonally packed 1D nanopores based on a covalent organic framework. The nanopores are densely decorated with guanidinium ion (Gu+) pendants capable of forming salt bridges with oxyanionic species. GlueCOF strongly adheres to biopolymers through multivalent salt&#8208;bridging interactions with their ubiquitous oxyanionic species. By taking advantage of its strong bio&#8208;adhesive nature, we succeeded in creating a gate that possibly opens the nanopores through a selective interaction with a reporter chemical and releases guest molecules. We chose calmodulin (CaM) as a gating component that can stably entrap a loaded guest, sulforhodamine&#8197;B (SRB), within the nanopores (CaMCOF&#8835;SRB). CaM is known to change its conformation on binding with Ca2+ ions. We confirmed that mixing CaMCOF&#8835;SRB with Ca2+ resulted in the release of SRB from the nanopores, whereas the use of weakly binding Mg2+ ions resulted in a much slower release of SRB.

         <title>Cascaded Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Towards Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Lasers Beyond 850&#8197;nm</title>

Six&#8208;level energy systems are constructed through the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer consisting of a first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and a following dominant and irreversible proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, which support the NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm for exploiting energy&#8208;level systems of OSSLs, especially at the NIR region from 780 to 2500&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic solid&#8208;state lasers play an essential role in applications ranging from laser communication to infrared night vision, but progress in this area is restricted by the lack of effective excited&#8208;state gain processes. Herein, we originally proposed and demonstrated the cascaded occurrence of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer for constructing the completely new energy&#8208;level systems. Cascading by the first ultrafast proton transfer of &lt;430&#8197;fs and the subsequent irreversible second proton transfer of ca. 1.6&#8197;ps, the stepwise proton transfer process favors the true six&#8208;level photophysical cycle, which supports efficient population inversion and thus NIR single&#8208;mode lasing at 854&#8197;nm. This work realizes longest wavelength beyond 850&#8197;nm of organic single&#8208;crystal lasing to date and originally exploits the cascaded excited&#8208;state molecular proton transfer energy&#8208;level systems for organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9045-9054, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 photoreduction with Ni&#8208;ZrO2 as a catalyst under UV/Vis light was monitored by 13C&#8208;labeled mass chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, and EXAFS. The interplay of bicarbonate reduction to CO over ZrO2 owing to charge separation by light with subsequent hydrogenation of CO over Ni heated from light enabled CO2 reduction to methane.







Abstract
The reaction mechanism of CO2 photoreduction into methane was elucidated by time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ FTIR spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under 13CO2, H2, and UV/Vis light, 13CH4 was formed at a rate of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 using Ni (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%)&#8208;ZrO2 that was effective at 96&#8197;kPa. Under UV/Vis light irradiation, the 13CO2 exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO2, followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni0 sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni0, which was reversibly heated to 394&#8197;K owing to the heat converted from light. With D2O and H2, the H/D ratio in the formed methane agreed with reactant H/D ratio. This study paves the way for using first row transition metals for solar fuel generation using only UV/Vis light.

UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation process of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In their Communication on page&#8197;8673, Mingzhu Li, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers utilize the tautomerism of &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecules under UV light illumination to protect the PSC from degradation and enable molecular defect passivation, achieving high efficiency and long&#8208;term UV stability of PSCs.

In their Communication on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202100218"&gt;page&#8197;8673&lt;/a&gt;, Mingzhu Li, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers utilize the tautomerism of &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecules under UV light illumination to protect the PSC from degradation and enable molecular defect passivation, achieving high efficiency and long&#8208;term UV stability of PSCs.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 9143-9143, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calbistrin biosynthesis involves an unusual dual&#8208;functional polyketide synthase CalA, which synthesizes both of the two structurally distinct moieties of calbistrins. The product divergence is intriguingly controlled by two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and a trans&#8208;acting C&#8208;methyltransferanse CalH, to yield the decalin and polyene portions, respectively. The esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD, as reported by Yudai Matsuda, Ikuro Abe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;8851.

         <title>Circadian Rhythms and the Transcriptional Feedback Loop (Nobel Lecture)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8650-8666, April 12, 2021. </description>

Circadian rhythms are present in most if not all animals, plants, and even photosynthetic cyanobacteria. These cyanobacterial clocks as well as plant clocks are very different from those of animals, with no credible homology between the different clock proteins. Therefore circadian rhythms probably emerged multiple times in evolution, which underscores their importance.

Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs), rising stars of luminescent materials, are the marriage of multicolor fluorescent materials and polymeric hydrogels. They have many extraordinary properties, such as a tissue&#8208;like modulus, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, and fluorescence color change. In this Review, recent progress in MFPHs is summarized, with a particular focus on the construction methods and important applications.







Abstract
Multicolor fluorescent polymeric hydrogels (MFPHs) are three&#8208;dimensionally crosslinked hydrophilic polymer networks with tunable emission color. Different from the classic fluorescent materials that are used primarily in dry solid states or solutions, MFPHs exist as highly water&#8208;swollen quasi&#8208;solids. They thus present many promising properties of both solids and solution, including tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, an intrinsic soft and wet nature, fabulous biocompatibility, along with a responsive volume, shape, and fluorescence color change. These advantageous properties hold great potential in many applications such as sensing, bioimaging, information encoding, encryption, biomimetic actuators, and soft robotics. This Review gives an in&#8208;depth overview of recent progress in the field of MFPHs, with a particular focus on the diverse construction methods and important demonstrated applications. Current challenges and future perspectives on MFPHs are also discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8211;Base Free Main Group Carbonyl Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8626-8648, April 12, 2021. </description>

Recently, hitherto elusive acid&#8208; and base&#8208;free main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from group&#8197;13 to 15 elements have been isolated in crystalline form. Their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Main group carbonyl analogues (R2E=O) derived from p&#8208;block elements (E=groups&#8197;13 to 15) have long been considered as elusive species. Previously, employment of chemical tricks such as acid&#8208; and base&#8208;stabilization protocols granted access to these transient species in their masked forms. However, electronic and steric effects inevitably perturb their chemical reactivity and distinguish them from classical carbonyl compounds. A new era was marked by the recent isolation of acid&#8211;base free main group carbonyl analogues, ranging from a lighter boracarbonyl to the heavier silacarbonyls, phosphacarbonyls and a germacarbonyl. Most importantly, their unperturbed nature elicits exciting new chemistry, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry. In this Review, we survey the strategies used for the isolation of such systems and document their emerging reactivity profiles, with a view to providing fundamental comparisons both with carbon and transition metal oxo species. This highlights the emerging opportunities for exciting &#8220;crossover&#8221; reactivity offered by these derivatives of the p&#8208;block elements.

         <dc:description>
The latest developments in the large&#8208;scale production of carbon quantum dots by using microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques are outlined. The synthetic methods for generating carbon dot/polymer composites are summarized, whereby the carbon quantum dots can serve as fillers, monomers, or initiators. Promising applications, current challenges, and future perspectives are also highlighted and discussed.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CDs) have inspired vast interest because of their excellent photoluminescence (PL) performances and their promising applications in optoelectronic, biomedical, and sensing fields. The development of effective approaches for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs may greatly promote the further advancement of their practical applications. In this Minireview, the newly emerging methods for the large&#8208;scale production of CDs are summarized, such as microwave, ultrasonic, plasma, magnetic hyperthermia, and microfluidic techniques. The use of the available strategies for constructing CD/polymer composites with intriguing solid&#8208;state PL is then described. Particularly, the multiple roles of CDs are emphasized, including as fillers, monomers, and initiators. Moreover, typical applications of CD/polymer composites in light&#8208;emitting diodes, fluorescent printing, and biomedicine are outlined. Finally, we discuss current problems and speculate on their future development.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Machinery Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Vehicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8596-8606, April 12, 2021. </description>

Spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery is of great importance for developing chemical biology tools for manipulating cellular DNA sequences to treat genetic disorders. This Minireview provides an overview of synthetic approaches and specific chemistries that have been used to develop stimuli&#8208;responsive vehicles for CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and genome editing in a controlled manner.







Abstract
Recent innovations in genome editing have enabled the precise manipulation of the genetic information of mammalians, and benefitted the development of next&#8208;generation gene therapy. Despite these advances, several barriers to the clinical translation of genome editing remain, including the intracellular delivery of genome editing machinery, and the risk of off&#8208;target editing effect. Here, we review the recent advance of spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery, which is composed of programmable Cas9 nuclease and a single&#8208;guide RNA (sgRNA) using stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. We discuss the specific chemistries that have been used for controlled Cas9/sgRNA delivery and intracellular release in the presence of endogenous or external signals. These methodologies can leverage biological signals found locally within disease cells, or exogenous signals administrated with spatiotemporal control, through which an improved genome editing could be achieved. We also discuss the future in exploiting these approaches for fundamental biomedical applications and therapeutic genome editing.

         <title>Tautomeric Molecule Acts as a &#8220;Sunscreen&#8221; for Metal Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8673-8677, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harmful UV light and surface defects accelerate the degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A tautomeric &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule can be used to protect the PSC from UV degradation and enable molecular defect passivation (defect formation energy: &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV) through interactions between functional groups and defects. This strategy provides high&#8208;efficiency PSCs with long&#8208;term UV stability.







Abstract
UV light always does great harm to perovskite solar cells, relentlessly degrading perovskites and shortening the lifetime of perovskite devices. Meanwhile, surface defects in perovskite films further accelerate the degradation process and serve as nonradiative charge recombination centers to deteriorate device efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a &#8220;sunscreen&#8221; molecule, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone, not only protects the perovskite solar cell from UV degradation but also enables molecular defect passivation through interaction between functional groups and defects by molecular tautomerism under UV light illumination. Therefore, the sunscreen strategy efficiently enhances the UV endurance of PSCs and improves defect formation energy to &#8722;1.35&#8197;eV. The perovskite solar cell with sunscreen (sunscreen PSC) exhibits outstanding efficiencies of up to 23.09&#8201;% (0.04&#8197;cm2) and 19.73&#8201;% (1.00&#8197;cm2) as well as long&#8208;term UV (UVa: 365&#8197;nm and UVb: 285&#8197;nm) stability.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Titanium Carbide (MXene) Enabled by Iodine Etching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8689-8693, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;assisted method has been developed for etching bulk Ti3AlC2 in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN), resulting in 2D MXene sheets (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with intact lattice, high yield (71&#8201;%), large size (1.8&#8197;&#956;m) and ultimate thickness (&lt;5&#8197;nm). 2D MXene sheets present great ambient stability in water for at least 2&#8197;weeks and high gravimetric capacitances of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 when serving as electrode materials for supercapacitors.







Abstract
MXene (e.g., Ti3C2) represents an important class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials owing to its unique metallic conductivity and tunable surface chemistry. However, the mainstream synthetic methods rely on the chemical etching of MAX powders (e.g., Ti3AlC2) using hazardous HF or alike, leading to MXene sheets with fluorine termination and poor ambient stability in colloidal dispersions. Here, we demonstrate a fluoride&#8208;free, iodine (I2) assisted etching route for preparing 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx, T=O, OH) with oxygen&#8208;rich terminal groups and intact lattice structure. More than 71&#8201;% of sheets are thinner than 5&#8197;nm with an average size of 1.8&#8197;&#956;m. They present excellent thin&#8208;film conductivity of 1250&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and great ambient stability in water for at least 2 weeks. 2D MXene sheets with abundant oxygen surface groups are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, delivering a high gravimetric capacitance of 293&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a scan rate of 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, superior to those made from fluoride&#8208;based etchants (&lt;290&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1). Our strategy provides a promising pathway for the facile and sustainable production of highly stable MXene materials.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8705-8709, April 12, 2021. </description>

It is a tough task to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst is designed to achieve IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Among the reported single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is realized by Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Converting CO2 and H2O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#8208;Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS2). The evolution rate of CH4 over Ni&#8208;CoS2 is up to 101.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS2 with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH4&#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS2 could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH4. This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8760-8765, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first potent and selective small&#8208;molecule SETDB1 tandem tudor domain (TTD) inhibitor, (R,R)&#8208;59, is reported. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder&#8208;competitive inhibitor and also showed activities in intact cells. The enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show any activity.







Abstract
SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (Cpd1), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor (R,R)&#8208;59 through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization. (R,R)&#8208;59 showed a KD value of 0.088&#177;0.045&#8197;&#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of (R,R)&#8208;59 was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the (R,R)&#8208;59&#8208;TTD complex. (R,R)&#8208;59 is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer (S,S)&#8208;59 did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of (R,R)&#8208;59 as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.

         <title>Formation of Nanoscale [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ from Condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ Keggin Polycations**

Self&#8208;condensation of &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ upon thermal aging is proposed as the mechanism for the formation of tetrameric [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ (Ge4Al4820+).







Abstract
Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compounds with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previous reports indicated that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#1013;&#8208;isomers &#1013;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS. Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#1013;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.

         <title>Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8798-8802, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited current density, production rate as well as selectivity hinder the improvement of HCOOH production from CO2 electroreduction. Here, bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) displays outstanding performances for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH, which not only shows excellent selectivity, but also achieves a high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and especially the maximum HCOOH production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) ever reported.







Abstract
Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO2 electroreduction. However, most of the catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to HCOOH in aqueous solution often suffer from low current density and limited production rate. Herein, we provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeOx) catalyst, which exhibits not only high current density (149&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), but also unprecedented production rate (2600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with high Faradaic efficiency (FE, 92&#8201;%) for HCOOH generation in aqueous media. Furthermore, Bi/CeOx also shows favorable stability over 34&#8197;h. We hope this work could offer an attractive and promising strategy to develop efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction with superior activity and desirable stability.

Nitrosobenzene can simultaneously activate the C&#8722;H bonds of aldehydes and the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acids triggering a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming process that leads to the synthesis of ketones via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free practical, scalable, and operationally easy method for the synthesis of ketones.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and boronic acids via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reaction is reported. The method employs nitrosobenzene as a reagent to drive the simultaneous activation of the boronic acid as a boronate and the activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the aldehyde as an iminium species that triggers the key C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming step via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.

         <title>Structural Revision of Natural Cyclic Depsipeptide MA026 Established by Total Synthesis and Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8792-8797, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revised structure of natural cyclic depsipeptide MA026 with tight junction opening activity was established by physicochemical analysis and confirmed by its total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that the stereochemistry of amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained.







Abstract
A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from Pseudomonas sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90&#8201;%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.

Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that the stereochemistry of amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revised structure of natural 14&#8208;mer cyclic depsipeptide MA026, isolated from &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. RtlB026 in 2002 was established by physicochemical analysis with HPLC, MS/MS, and NMR and confirmed by total solid&#8208;phase synthesis. The revised structure differs from that previously reported in that two amino acid residues, assigned in error, have been replaced. Synthesized MA026 with the revised structure showed a tight junction (TJ) opening activity like that of the natural one in a cell&#8208;based TJ opening assay. Bioinformatic analysis of the putative MA026 biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of RtIB026 demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each amino acid residue in the revised structure can be reasonably explained. Phylogenetic analysis with xantholysin BGC indicates an exceptionally high homology (ca. 90&#8201;%) between xantholysin and MA026. The TJ opening activity of MA026 when binding to claudin&#8208;1 is a key to new avenues for transdermal administration of large hydrophilic biologics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Atypical Hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Overlay of Spin&#8208;Crossovers and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8803-8807, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] complex is converted through melting from a crystal phase showing a very gradual spin&#8208;crossover to another one showing a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition. The uncommon &#8220;rounded&#8221; hysteresis occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system. It is due to a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that is triggered when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.







Abstract
The [FeII(C6F5Tp)2] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviours: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of ca. 65&#8197;K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated with a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occur in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated with the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly ca. 50&#8201;% of the SCO complexes are switched.

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as a Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8766-8771, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve sugars, differing in size and stereochemistry, were used as building blocks in a modular, efficient four&#8208;step synthetic route to multifunctional BODIPY glycoconjugates with high fluorescence and hydrophilicity. The chiral information was transferred unchanged, thereby providing complex and distinct probes for target&#8208;oriented binding studies and specific in&#8197;vivo imaging.







Abstract
A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trisaccharides) is shown to take part in a straightforward four&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility with several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated, thus suggesting a universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugates, which we call GlycoBODIPYs. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift in the spectra, thereby furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments illustrate efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Using an Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Molecular Reporter</title>

With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting a liquid&#8208;like assembly into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging has been used to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of nanoparticle surfactants at the water/oil interface by using aggregation&#8208;induced emission as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state (see graph).







Abstract
With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs), a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like into a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network is denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. It is a challenge to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, since both jamming and vitrification lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Herein, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP surfactants at the water/oil interface using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. The AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior at densities at which they can move and rotate. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the smaller intermolecular separation distance arrests rotation, and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.

Abstract
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes that realizes over 90&#8201;% ee is the ultimate challenge in alkylnitrile addition chemistry. Herein, we report achieving high enantioselectivity by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex, which afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles. This highly atom&#8208;economical process paves the way for exploiting inexpensive acetonitrile as a promising C2 building block in a practical synthetic toolbox for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in a Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8668-8672, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel nanoclusters Au48(m&#8208;MB)26 and Au46(m&#8208;MBT)26 have been synthesized and fully characterized, and the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in metal nanoclusters has been achieved for the first time. The two kernel atoms reduction leads to the photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) increase by almost four times. In addition, kernel bond length dependent photoluminescence and kernel charge state were first revealed.

Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation. Photoluminescence (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel nanoclusters Au&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;(m&#8208;MB)&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; and Au&lt;sub&gt;46&lt;/sub&gt;(m&#8208;MBT)&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; have been synthesized and fully characterized, and the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in metal nanoclusters has been achieved for the first time. The two kernel atoms reduction leads to the photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) increase by almost four times. In addition, kernel bond length dependent photoluminescence and kernel charge state were first revealed.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization Enhanced Nuclear Spin Optical Rotation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8823-8826, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) signals are enhanced by hyperpolarization of nuclear spins using dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization. The signal enhancement leads to the measurement of the NSOR constant of dimethyl sulfoxide. A spectroscopy based on hyperpolarized NSOR offers the possibility to provide information on ground and excited electronic states in molecules, localized to an NMR&#8208;addressable site.







Abstract
Nuclear spin optical rotation (NSOR) has been investigated as a magneto&#8208;optical effect, which holds the potential for applications, including hybrid optical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gradientless imaging. The intrinsic nature of NSOR renders its detection relatively insensitive, which has prevented it moving from a proof of concept to a method supporting chemical characterizations. In this work, the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization technique is introduced to provide nuclear spin polarization, increasing the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by several thousand times. NSOR signals of 1H and 19F nuclei are observed in a single scan for diluted compounds, which has made this effect suitable for the determination of electronic transitions from a specific nucleus in a large molecule.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Acyclic &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8786-8791, April 12, 2021. </description>

A method for catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides was developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Enhanced selectivity was realized for the catalytic KR process using cyclic tertiary amine as a base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched acyclic &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides are valuable compounds in chemical, material and medicinal sciences, but their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. A catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of such amides with selectivity factor(s) up to &gt;200 is developed via enantioselective acylation of primary alcohol with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. An enhanced selectivity for the catalytic KR process is realized using cyclic tertiary amine as base additive. Diastereomeric transition state models for the process are proposed to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Unprecedented Reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Amino Cyclopentenone Enables Diversity&#8208;Oriented Access to Functionalized Indoles and Indole&#8208;Annulated Ring Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8808-8812, April 12, 2021. </description>

This work highlights diversity&#8208;oriented access to cyclopentenoid indoles and indole&#8208;alkaloid like structures which is pillared on an unprecedented latent reactivity of &#947;&#8208;aminoenones. The transformation highlights &#947;&#8208; or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;functionalization of enones to generate new structural space. A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.







Abstract
Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/N&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a one&#8208;pot operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the gem&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Iridium and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8827-8831, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been achieved by the combination of iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.







Abstract
The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.

     alt="Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Iridium and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been achieved by the combination of iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route for the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from bench&#8208;stable feedstocks.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with chiral thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable and the thiourea catalyst can be recycled and reused.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8722-8727, April 12, 2021. </description>

A new and reversible 1&#8208;dimensional DNA nanostructure, assembled from DNA triplexes and G&#8208;quadruplexes, is reported. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; nanostructures require potassium ions and acidic pH to form and are easily disassembled by removal of either requirement. We anticipate that they will find unique and varied application as communication modules, sensors, logic gates, and in diverse other uses of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt;150&#8197;nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Carbons: Half Covalent, Half Ionic</title>

Fifteen global minima of the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series contain a true planar hexacoordinate carbon. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that the carbon atom is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.







Abstract
Herein, the first global minima containing a planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) atom are reported. The fifteen structures belong to the CE3M3+ (E=S&#8211;Te and M=Li&#8211;Cs) series and satisfy both geometric and electronic criteria to be considered as a true phC. The design strategy consisted of replacing oxygen in the D3h&#8197;CO3Li3+ structure with heavy and less electronegative chalcogens, inducing a negative charge on the C&#8197;atom and an attractive electrostatic interaction between C and the alkali&#8208;metal cations. The chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to three chalcogens and ionically connected to the three alkali metals.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;EM Resolves Molecular Recognition Of An Optojasp Photoswitch Bound To Actin Filaments In Both Switch States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8678-8682, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting actin requires spatiotemporal control of drug activity. Optojasps are photo&#8208;switchable small molecules, providing direct optical spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton. We present high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of both isomeric states of an optojasp bound to F&#8208;actin and describe in detail the binding pocket and conformational changes associated with switching of the azobenzene.







Abstract
Actin is essential for key processes in all eukaryotic cells. Cellpermeable optojasps provide spatiotemporal control of the actin cytoskeleton, confining toxicity and potentially rendering F&#8208;actin druggable by photopharmacology. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structures of both isomeric states of one optojasp bound to actin filaments. The high&#8208;resolution structures reveal for the first time the pronounced effects of photoswitching a functionalized azobenzene. By characterizing the optojasp binding site and identifying conformational changes within F&#8208;actin that depend on the optojasp isomeric state, we refine determinants for the design of functional F&#8208;actin photoswitches.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for the Active Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8750-8754, April 12, 2021. </description>

Janus Ga/Zn micromotors powered by bubbles are presented as an integrated platform with autonomous movement, self&#8208;degradability, and bacteriostatic capacity. The micromotors are applied to the active target treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.







Abstract
We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment of bacteria. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles and display self&#8208;propulsion in simulated gastroenteric acid (pH&#8197;0.5) at a speed of up to 383&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, propelled by hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8211;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8211;Zn galvanic effect. The GaIII cations produced from the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors serve as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of GaIII and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against H.&#8197;pylori, compared with passive Ga microparticles. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof of concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.

An easily synthesized building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond were synthesized for application in solar cells. The polymer offered a power conversion efficiency of 16.1&#8201;%, a nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV, and a singlet&#8208;triplet gap as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, demonstrating the promising prospect of B&#8208;N&#8208;containing materials in organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) largely rely on polymer donors. Herein, we report a new building block BNT and a relevant polymer PBNT&#8208;BDD featuring B&#8208;N covalent bond for application in OSCs. The BNT unit is synthesized in only 3 steps, leading to the facile synthesis of PBNT&#8208;BDD. When blended with a nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO, PBNT&#8208;BDD afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.1&#8201;% in an OSC, comparable to the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT)&#8208;based counterpart. The nonradiative recombination energy loss of 0.19&#8197;eV was afforded by PBNT&#8208;BDD. PBNT&#8208;BDD also exhibited weak crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6&#8208;BO, benefitting of morphological stability. The singlet&#8211;triplet gap (&#916;EST) of PBNT&#8208;BDD is as low as 0.15&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of common organic semiconductors (&#8805;0.6&#8197;eV). As a result, the triplet state of PBNT&#8208;BDD is higher than the charge transfer (CT) state, which would suppress the recombination via triplet state effectively.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Electric Coupling in a Cobalt(II)&#8208;Based Spin Triangle Revealed by Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Modulated Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8832-8838, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution describes the observation of spin&#8211;electric coupling utilizing electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated ESR (EFM&#8208;ESR) spectroscopy for single&#8208;crystals of a spin triangle which is characterized by the strong magnetic anisotropy of the individual cobalt(II) centers and a pronounced sensitivity of the molecular energy levels on the relative orientation of their magnetic axes as well as the exchange coupling between them.







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based spin triangle shows a significant spin&#8211;electric coupling. [Co3(pytag)(py)6Cl3]ClO4&#8901;3&#8201;py crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group P21. The intra&#8208;triangle antiferromagnetic interaction, of the order of ca. &#8722;15&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (H=&#8722;JSaSb), leads to spin frustration. The two expected energy&#8208;degenerate ground doublets are, however, separated by a few wavenumbers, as a consequence of magnetic anisotropy and deviations from threefold symmetry. The Co3&#8197;planes of symmetry&#8208;related molecules are almost parallel, allowing for the determination of the spin&#8211;electric properties of single crystals by EFM&#8208;ESR spectroscopy. The spin&#8211;electric effect detected when the electric field is applied in the Co3&#8197;plane was revealed by a shift in the resonance field. It was quantified as &#916;gE/E=0.11&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;m&#8201;V&#8722;1, which in terms of frequency corresponds to approximately 0.3&#8197;Hz&#8201;m&#8201;V&#8722;1. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu3&#8197;triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20&#8197;times larger for the latter.

         <title>Stable Thermotropic 3D and 2D Double Gyroid Nanostructures with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm Feature Size from Scalable Sugar&#8211;Polyolefin Conjugates</title>

Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, provide highly ordered and exceptionally stable thermotropic hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL) and double gyroid (DG) nanostructured phases. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15 nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight disaccharide&#8211;polyolefin conjugates with cellobiose, lactose and maltose head groups and atactic polypropene tails, such as 1, undergo a series of irreversible thermotropic order&#8211;order transitions with increasing temperature to provide nanostructured phases in the sequence: lamellar (L), hexagonal perforated lamellar (HPL), double gyroid (DG) and hexagonal cylindrical (C). The DG phase displays exceptional stability at ambient temperature and features two interpenetrating sugar domain networks having a sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm strut width and a lattice parameter, aDG, of 13.1&#8197;nm. The unique stability of this DG phase extends further within ultrathin films all the way down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit of 15&#8197;nm in which film thickness, l, is now less than the surface&#8208;oriented unit cell height, hDG. In addition to raising the fundamental question of what minimally constitutes a Schoen triply periodic minimal surface and DG lattice, these results serve to establish the class of sugar&#8211;polyolefin conjugates as a new material platform for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

The asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters has been achieved, in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities, employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs).







Abstract
N&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters are widely used as chiral intermediates in a range of pharmaceuticals. Here we report the enantioselective biocatalyic synthesis of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters through the direct reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters and amines employing sequence diverse metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs). Both enantiomers of N&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained with high conversion and excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. In addition &gt;20 different preparative scale transformations were performed highlighting the scalability of this system.

         <title>Blatter&#8208;Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8683-8688, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely stable Blatter's type organic radicals grafted into the mesoporous silica show advanced relaxation properties at room temperature. Electron spin decoherence time exceeds that in many other qubit candidates, allowing efficient spin manipulation at ambient conditions. The tuneable multifunctional nature of such composite materials promotes them as promising nanoplatforms for developing new spin&#8208;based quantum bits.







Abstract
Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date are not applicable at ambient conditions. Herein, we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to Tm&#8776;2.3&#8197;&#956;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. The mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.

An efficient electrochemical radical silyl&#8208;oxygenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is demonstrated, which gives access to a variety of highly functionalized silicon&#8208;containing molecules, including &#946;&#8208;silyl&#8208;cyanohydrin derivatives in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions without the use of transition&#8208;metal catalyst or chemical oxidant.







Abstract
An efficient electrochemical radical silyl&#8208;oxygenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is demonstrated, which gives access to a variety of new highly functionalized silicon&#8208;containing molecules, including &#946;&#8208;silyl&#8208;cyanohydrin derivatives in good yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity. This electrochemical radical silylation process conducts under mild conditions without the use of transition metal catalyst or chemical oxidant and exhibits a wide scope of substrate silanes with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ability to access silyl radicals using electrochemical Si&#8722;H activation offers new perspectives for the synthesis of valuable organosilicon compounds in a sustainable and green manner.

         <title>A Desaturase&#8208;Like Enzyme Catalyzes Oxazole Formation in Pseudomonas Indolyloxazole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8781-8785, April 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyloxazole alkaloids are widespread natural products with diverse bioactivities but previously unknown biosynthesis. Transposon mutagenesis, heterologous pathway expression, and labeling experiments provide evidence for a Pseudomonas pathway involving oxazole formation by cyclization as a new reaction type catalyzed by a desaturase&#8208;like enzyme.







Abstract
Indolyloxazole alkaloids occur in diverse micro&#8208; and macroorganisms and exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities. Despite their ubiquitous occurrence and simple structures, the biosynthetic pathway remained unknown. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in the labradorin producer Pseudomonas entomophila to identify a cryptic biosynthetic locus encoding an N&#8208;acyltransferase and a non&#8208;heme diiron desaturase&#8208;like enzyme. Heterologous expression in E. coli demonstrates that both enzymes are sufficient to produce indolyloxazoles. Probing their function in stable&#8208;isotope feeding experiments, we provide evidence for an unusual desaturase mechanism that generates the oxazole by decarboxylative cyclization.

         <title>Chiral Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores by Self&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling of Cationic Helicenes with Amines/Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 16, Page 8733-8738, April 12, 2021. </description>

Cationic dioxa[6]helicene oxidizes alkyl amines to enamines and further reacts in situ as an electrophile to form, in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step cascades, fully delocalized mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original approach provides chiral cyanine&#8208;like chromophores that absorb up to the NIR and fluoresce alike, with intense NIR ECD (&#916;&#1013; up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1). DFT showcases the importance of conformers in the strong chiroptical response.







Abstract
In one pot, tertiary alkyl amines are oxidized to enamines by cationic dioxa[6]helicene, which further reacts as electrophile and oxidant to form mono or bis donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor coupling products. This original and convergent synthetic approach provides a strong extension of conjugation yielding chromophores that absorb intensively in far&#8208;red or NIR domains (&#955;max up to 791&#8197;nm) and fluoresce in the NIR as well (&#955;max up to 887&#8197;nm). Intense ECD properties around 790&#8197;nm with a |&#916;&#1013;| value up to 60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 are observed.
