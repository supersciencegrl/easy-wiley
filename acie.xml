         <title>Beyond Structure: Methylation Fine&#8208;Tunes Stability and Folding Kinetics of bcl2Mid G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a single 5&#8208;methylcytosine into a G&#8208;rich sequence originating from the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter affects both the folding kinetics and thermodynamics of the two G4 structures and thus plays a crucial role in regulating G4 folding pathways, which has significant implications for the control of gene expression.








Abstract
Cytosine methylation, a key epigenetic modification in the regulation of gene expression, raises intriguing questions about its role in the formation and thermodynamic stability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. We investigated the impact of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine residue (Cm) on the well&#8208;characterized bcl2Mid G4 structure that forms in a GC&#8208;rich region of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene promoter, which influences its expression. Using solution&#8208;state NMR and biophysical techniques, we discovered an unexpected sequence&#8208;specific effect of Cm on the folding kinetics of bcl2Mid G4. Specifically, substituting cytosine at position C6 with C6m&#160; slows down G4 folding kinetics and influences the equilibrium between major and minor structures in the presence of K+ ions. Notably, the increased population of the minor structure enabled the characterization of its previously unidentified topology. Additionally, the presence of a single Cm residue induces local structural rearrangements in the major G4 structure and decreases its thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, we found that the zinc finger 3 motif of the Sp1 transcription factor preferentially binds to the minor G4 structure. These results suggest that Cm not only influences G4 polymorphism but may also regulate interactions with transcription factors, potentially affecting the regulation of gene expression.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Ni&#8211;Mn Diatomic Site Catalysts for Efficient Seawater Electrolysis via the Degradation of High Ionization Potential Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively constructs a dual transition metal atoms catalytic system through the strategic anchoring of Ni and Mn atoms on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (O&#8208;BN), achieving breakthrough performance in simultaneous high ionization potential pollutant degradation and hydrogen evolution for marine energy applications under light condition.








Abstract
In response to energy shortages and hard&#8208;to&#8208;degrade chemical pollution, especially high ionization potential (IP) organic pollutants, this study developed a novel photoelectrocatalyst, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, for degrading IP pollutants in seawater and generating hydrogen. Incorporating Ni&#8211;Mn dual atoms into an O&#8208;doped boron nitride (OBN) framework, Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN, shows excellent stability and HER performance. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis revealed its low Gibbs free energy change (&#916;GH* = 0.03&#160;eV) for HER, outperforming Pt (111). Achieving an ultralow overpotential of 43.8&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 under AM 1.5G, simulated light surpasses commercial Pt/C catalysts. High IP pollutants enhance hydrogen evolution rates, indicating a synergistic effect. Theoretical calculations elucidated the interplay between seawater electrolytes and high IP values on the photoelectrocatalytic performance. Ni&#8208;Mn@OBN demonstrated excellent stability and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 3.72%, offering a sustainable solution for marine pollution control and clean energy production.

         <title>DNA Nanotubule&#8208;Based Nanodevices with ATP&#8208;Responsive Gating for Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Nucleic Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of two pathways for macromolecular therapeutics delivery: nanoparticle&#8208;adopted endocytosis (left) and DNA nanotubule&#8208;mediated cytosolic delivery (right). By bypassing conventional endocytic routes, the nanotubules directly transport substantial payloads, including nucleic acids and proteins, across the plasma membrane. 








Abstract
Delivering biomacromolecules to the cytosol remains a formidable challenge, as these molecules are predominantly sequestered within endosomes after endocytosis. The limited efficacy of current delivery systems in promoting reliable endosomal escape underscores the need for innovative strategies. Here, we report a DNA origami nanotubule to construct transmembrane delivery nanodevices with size&#8208;selective gating and ATP&#8208;responsive channel activation. By integrating unilamellar vesicles as large storage compartments, these nanodevices can encapsulate a wide range of macromolecules, including small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, plasmid DNA, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. By bypassing traditional endocytic pathways, the nanotubules enable the delivery of substantial payload quantities directly across the plasma membrane. This approach provides a promising platform for delivering macromolecular therapeutics into the cytosol, advancing gene therapy strategies, and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Tetranuclear Titanium Nitride Cluster: Dinitrogen Cleavage Under Mild Conditions and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Heating the trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. Complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBpin)Cl}2]. When treated with pyridine or DMAP, complex 2 was dissociated to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex. 








Abstract
Heating the readily available trinuclear Ti dinitrogen complex [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#181;3&#8208;&#951;1:&#8201;&#951;2:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] 1(Cp*&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5), originally reported by C. Y&#233;lamos and J. Jover, in benzene at 80&#160;&#176;C leads to the cleavage of N&#8801;N bond, forming a tetranuclear titanium nitride cluster [{TiCp*}4Cl(&#181;&#8208;Cl)3(&#181;3&#8208;N)2] 2. The structure of 2 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Kinetics study and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the energy barrier for the NN bond cleavage in the transformation from 1 to 2 is about 26&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Complex 2 exhibits reactivity toward various electrophiles, producing a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds in the presence of air, while concurrently regenerating Ti(IV) salts. Furthermore, complex 2 reacts with pinacolborane, leading to the formation of N&#8208;B bond derivatives [{TiCp*(&#181;&#8208;NBPin)Cl}2] 3. When complex 2&#8211;15N is treated with pyridine or 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), it dissociates to form a bent trinuclear Ti nitrido complex [{TiCp*}3Cl3(L)2(&#181;&#8208;15N)2] 4&#8208;L (L&#160;=&#160;py or DMAP).

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries via Using I&#8722;&#8208;Based Active Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;organic battery (Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 battery) is developed by using an I&#8722;&#8208;based active cathodic electrolyte. Benefiting from the high redox potential of the I&#8722;/I0 redox couple, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell harvests a high average discharge voltage (0.75&#160;V vs. Zn/Zn2+) and outstanding cycling stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Organic cathodes possess inherent structural diversity and fast redox kinetics, showing great application prospects in aqueous Zn batteries. Nevertheless, most of the reported organic cathodes display low average working voltage resulting in poor energy density. Herein, diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN)@CMK&#8208;3 composite is utilized as cathode for aqueous zinc battery, which combines the Zn2+ and H+ co&#8208;storage and I&#8722;/I0 conversion by introducing I&#8722;&#8208;based active additive into 0.5&#160;M Zn(OTf)2 electrolyte. The in situ/ex situ analyses and computational studies disclose that HATN@CMK&#8208;3 with C&#9552;N groups not only stores Zn2+ and H+ ions at low potential but also acts as a substrate to promote the conversion reaction of I&#8722;/I0 at high potential. Accordingly, the Zn//HATN@CMK&#8208;3 cell delivers a high average voltage of 0.75&#160;V, prominent long&#8208;life (10&#160;000 cycles) and, high energy density (198&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, under high mass loading (10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) or low&#8208;temperature conditions, the cell still achieves decent capacity and cycle stability.

         <title>Tandem Dual&#8208;Ratiometric SERS Probe Enables Raman Imaging of Neurological pH Fluctuations in Epilepsy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a universal dendrimer&#8208;based approach, a highly sensitive tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric SERS probe with blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability, RHP@Au, is constructed to specifically visualize pH changes in brain disease. This sensor facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of neuroinflammation generation and pH fluctuations in living epileptic mice.








Abstract
An imbalance of brain pH is closely associated with biochemical reactions, ion regulation, and electrical activity, serving as a hallmark for various neurological disorders. High&#8208;resolution imaging of pH fluctuations in brain disease is crucial for understanding pathological processes. However, current pH probes are inadequate for this purpose due to poor blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration or insufficient specificity. Herein, we reported a tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe, RHP@AuS, capable of crossing the BBB to address these challenges. RHP@AuS leveraged dendrimers for the facile one&#8208;step synthesis of SERS probes, significantly enhancing signal intensity and reproducibility. RHP@AuS can be sequentially activated by neuroinflammation&#8208;associated H2O2 and pH, exhibiting highly selective ratiometric responses to pH fluctuations in brain disease. Dynamic SERS imaging revealed that during neuronal epileptic activity, inflammation increased and local pH dropped sharply to around 6.6. Building on these findings, a drug combination with dual neuroinflammation&#8208;mitigating and pH&#8208;regulating properties was developed, effectively alleviating epilepsy in mouse models. This study opens new avenues for developing imaging probes for the brain and deepens our understanding of the roles of pH in neurological disorders.

         <title>Structurally Engineering Multi&#8208;Shell Hollow Zeolite Single Crystals via Defect&#8208;Directed Oriented&#8208;Kinetics Transformation and Their Heterostructures for Hydrodeoxygenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline multi&#8208;shell hollow porous materials with high compartment capacity, large active surface area, and superior structural stability are expected to unlock tremendous potential across diverse critical applications. However, their synthetic methodology has not yet been well established. Here, we develop a defect&#8208;directed oriented&#8208;kinetics transformation approach to prepare multi&#8208;shell hollow aluminosilicate ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite (MFI) crystals with single&#8208;crystalline feature, hierarchical macro&#8208;/mesoporosity, controllable shell number, and high structural stability. The methodology lies in the creation of zeolite precursors consisting of multiple inhomogeneous layers with gradient&#8208;distributed defects along the [100] and [010] directions and irregularly discrete defects&#8208;rich regions along the [001] direction via continuous epitaxial growth. Subsequently, the locations with more defects could be preferentially etched to form voids or mesopores, meanwhile oriented recrystallization interconnects the nanoshells into a unified architecture along the [001] direction. Benefiting from the easily accessible bifunctional metal/acid sites and the capability for reactant accumulation, the resultant multi&#8208;shell hollow Ni&#8208;loaded zeolite catalysts show significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid into liquid fuels. The insight gained from this systematic study will facilitate the rational design and synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;shell hollow structured single&#8208;crystalline porous materials for a broad range of potential applications.

         <title>Octalenobisterphenylene and Its Diradical Dianionic Cyclodimer: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terphenylene dimer B, a fragment of the metallic (4,6,8)biphenylene network, with pronounced reactivity and strain was prepared from biaryl A by successive closures of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. The treatment of B with sodium metal induced cyclodimerization, yielding a diradical dianion [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] through a presumed radical&#8208;anion&#8208;mediated mechanism. The two spins in [(Na+)2(B&#8226;&#8211;)2] exhibit negligible mutual interaction.








Abstract
Octalenobisterphenylene 1 (also known as terphenylene dimer) was synthesized from 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;substituted biaryl by tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization followed by oxidative coupling. This one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol facilitated the successive formation of four four&#8208;membered and two eight&#8208;membered rings. Treatment of 1 with sodium metal, followed by crystallization from THF, yielded the remarkable diradical dianion [(1&#8226;&#8211;)2]2&#8722;, where the two molecular halves are connected by four &#963; bonds. The cyclodimerization is driven by the pronounced reactivity and strain of the central six&#8208;membered ring within the [3]phenylene subunit. The structure and diradical nature of [(Na+)2(1&#8226;&#8211;)2] were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, DFT computations, and 1H NMR and ESR spectra. These investigations revealed that the two spins, one on each molecular half, exhibit minimal mutual interaction.

Molecular crystals that belong to non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups demonstrate piezoelectricity by interconverting electrical and mechanical energy. The cover image shows molecular crystal unit cells interlocking into a crystalline electrified assembly. As Pierre&#8208;Andr&#233; Cazade, Sarah Guerin et al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202501232), the unit cell can be studied using computational chemistry to predict the piezoelectric response of a crystal and screen for sustainable materials in sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting.

         <title>Mechanically and Chemically Co&#8208;Robust Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Ultrahigh Capacity and Prolonged Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) materials are considered highly promising cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their practical application is limited by capacity loss and interface instability caused by chemical and mechanical failure during cycling. Doping has been identified as a direct and effective method to address these challenges. However, mechanistic understanding of doping enhanced electrochemical performance is still unclear. In this study, the introduction of high&#8208;valent Nb ions was employed to achieve mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling regulation, thereby concurrently improving the capacity and cycle life of NRLO. First, Nb5+ doping was conducted to refine secondary grains, achieving a "grain refinement" effect similar to that in ceramics and alloys, while further stabilizing the grain boundaries. The inter&#8208;grain fusion structure of NCM811&#8208;0.5Nb effectively dissipates lattice strain under highly delithiated state, suppresses oxygen loss, and prevents cracks that lead to fracture during cycling. Moreover, Nb doping stabilizes the monoclinic phase during phase transitions and promotes the formation of highly stable spinel twin boundaries after cycling. This study demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concurrent capacity and stability enhancement mechanisms attributed to Nb&#8208;doping and highlights the significant potential of the synergistic regulation of mechanical and chemical coupling in improving the capacity and lifespan of NRLOs by Nb&#8208;doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Schiff Base Complexes for Chemiluminogenic Bioprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were found to display enchanting chemiluminescence upon reaction with reactive oxygen species. The unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion was responsible for the unexpected chemiluminescence. Nanoparticles derived from chemiluminogenic iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were successfully employed as chemiluminescence imaging probes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Chemiluminogenic bioimaging has emerged as a promising paradigm due to its independence from light excitation, thereby circumventing challenges related to light penetration depth and background autofluorescence. However, the availability of effective chemiluminophores remains limited, which substantially impedes their bio&#8208;applications. Herein, we discovered for the first time that cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes can unexpectedly generate chemiluminescence. Notably, the chemiluminescence reaction was rapid, with a half&#8208;life of only 0.86&#8197;s, significantly faster than previously reported examples. Unlike conventional chemiluminescent scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of the chemiluminogenic iridium(III) complex is its unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion upon reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, the chemiluminogenicity of these complexes is not influenced by the cyclometalating ligands but is closely associated with the Schiff base ligand, allowing for tuning of the emission colors via altering the cyclometalating ligands. Additionally, we formulated one of the Schiff base complexes (1) as water&#8208;soluble chemiluminogenic nanoparticles (CLNPs) and successfully employed them as activatable chemiluminescence bioprobes for precise and rapid imaging of hypochlorite&#8208;related biological events both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We believe that this significant finding of the development of chemiluminogenic Schiff base complexes will greatly facilitate the designing of innovative chemiluminophores for theranostic applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected and Regioselective Arylation of Internal Alkenes with Simple Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective insertion of (hetero) aryl groups into the C&#8722;C double bond of unactivated internal alkenes by nondirected arene&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H activation has been achieved. The design and development of a new ligand&#8208;supported palladium catalysis, enables quick access to trisubstituted alkenes, especially E&#8208;1,2&#8208;diarylalkenes, from unfunctionalized simple raw materials in moderate to high yields, with excellent regio&#8208; and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of internal alkenes has become a highly efficient approach for preparing stereochemically defined multi&#8208;substituted olefins. Unlike traditional methods that require directing groups, activating groups, or active chemical bonds (e.g., halide, pseudo halide, organometallic reagent, etc.), there remains a strong demand for nondirected and selective functionalization of unactivated alkenes with simple coupling partners, both in academic research or industrial applications. Herein, we report the development of a pyridone&#8208;oxazoline (Pyoox) type ligand that combines the features of both pyridone and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline in assisting Pd&#8208;catalyzed olefination. This ligand enables the activation of simple (hetero) arenes and internal alkenes within a single reaction system. A nondirected and regioselective arylation from simple raw materials has been achieved, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted olefins in moderate to excellent yields, with excellent regio&#8208;/stereocontrol. Experimental and computational studies on mechanisms offer insight into the distinctive properties and performance of this ligand&#8208;promoted catalysis. The synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the simplified synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Conformal Reconstruction and Dual&#8208;Vacancy Engineering Breaks Kinetics Limitations for Energetic Aqueous Dual&#8208;Cation Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the local proton environment, we have realized precise manipulation of in situ reconstruction to yield dual vacancies and three&#8208;dimensional diffusion channels. The tailored dual vacancies favor the adsorption of charge carriers and ensure conformal reconstruction, at the same time, the residual Al presents the pining effect to suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, resulting in stable and energetic dual&#8208;cation storage.







Abstract
Efficient aqueous energy storage with non&#8208;metallic ions is highly desired but challenged by achieving kinetically favorable surface/interface storage chemistry. Herein, by refining the surface proton environment, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with hydrogen&#8208;aluminum dual vacancies and 3D diffusion channels are demonstrated upon conformal surface reconstruction. An energetic NH4+/H+ dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry is enabled, leading to a remarkable gravimetric specific capacity of up to 604&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;cycle stability. Combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we reveal and visualize the conformal reconstruction process and the reversible dual&#8208;cation storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the dual&#8208;vacancy coupling helps the dissolution of inert Al from LDHs for enriching active sites. At the same time, the residual Al shows the pining effect on the [MnO6] octahedron to restrain the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The manganese sites adjacent to Al vacancies promote the adsorption of NH4+/H+ and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH4+, responsible for an optimal dual&#8208;cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, responsible for an optimal dual-cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitigating Diffusion&#8208;Induced Intragranular Cracking in Single&#8208;Crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via Extended Solid&#8208;Solution Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

This study outlines a design strategy to enhance the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO cathodes by extending solid&#8208;solution behavior. Combined experimental and modeling approaches identify stress distribution within the crystal and demonstrate the role of Mg doping in mitigating intragranular cracking.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal cathodes have been investigated for their inherent resistance to intergranular cracking due to the absence of grain boundaries. However, these materials exhibit significant intragranular cracking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of extended solid&#8208;solution reactions on mitigating crack formation in magnesium&#8208;doped single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (Mg&#8208;SC&#8208;LNMO) cathodes. With Mg acting as a structural pillar, the overall volume change was reduced by nearly 50&#8201;%, the two&#8208;phase reaction was effectively suppressed, and the Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficient was doubled. Continuum modeling based on experimental observations demonstrates that Mg doping significantly reduces the internal stress induced by lithium diffusion, thereby preserving the mechanical integrity of single&#8208;crystal LNMO. This improvement leads to enhanced electrochemical performance and durability. Our study provides new insights into mechanically robust single&#8208;crystal cathodes and proposes a design strategy to improve the durability of next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Metastable Oxygen Redox Cathode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;free Li0.693[Li0.153Ni0.190Mn0.657]O2 (LLNMO) exhibits outstanding electrochemistry by harnessing both cation and anion redox activities. It features a metastable structure with both edge&#8208;sharing (E) and face&#8208;sharing (F) local geometries, distinct from conventional O3&#8208;type structures. The face&#8208;sharing local configuration provides enhanced stability and flexibility to modulate the interlayer interactions during de&#8208;/lithiation.







Abstract
Simultaneously harnessing cation and anion redox activities in the cathode is crucial for the development of high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, achieving long&#8208;term stability for both mechanisms remains a significant challenge due to pronounced anisotropic volume changes at low lithium content, unfavorable cation migration, and oxygen loss. Here, we demonstrate exceptionally stable cation and anion redox behavior in a metastable, cobalt&#8208;free layered oxide, Li0.693[Li0.153Ni0.190Mn0.657]O2 (LLNMO). After 50&#8197;cycles at 50&#8197;mA/g (~0.2&#8197;C), the cathode retains 97.4&#8201;% of its initial capacity (222.4&#8197;mAh/g) with negligible voltage decay. This remarkable stability is attributed to its metastable O6&#8208;type structure (R&#8208;3m symmetry) with unique local geometry. The face&#8208;sharing connectivity between lithium layers and alternating transition metal (TM) layers effectively suppresses TM migration&#8208;induced voltage decay during anion redox. Additionally, the structure balances interlayer cation/cation and anion/anion repulsions, resulting in minimal expansion and contraction during de&#8208;/lithiation (&lt;2.3&#8201;% along the c&#8208;axis) and excellent structural reversibility. These findings highlight that layered oxides with a metastable framework are promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Urea Complete Conversion to Compound Fertilizer in Industrial&#8208;Scale Tandem Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrial&#8208;grade tandem system was developed to fully convert urea (or urea wastewater) into compound fertilizer while generating H2. In a typical cycle, 200&#8197;g of urea was used to produce 232&#8197;L of pure H2 and 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) without further separation. The core is to develop an electrocatalyst (S&#8208;NiOOH&#8208;Ni(OH)2) with exceptional activity for urea oxidation.







Abstract
A compound fertilizer with NH4H2PO4 and KH2PO4 offer significant advantages in enhancing both crop yield and quality. Ammonia (NH3) is essential for the synthesis of the compound fertilizer, which was produced by an energy intensive chemical process. Developing efficient and environmental friendly methods to produce ammonia&#8208;containing compound fertilizers is crucial and extremely challenging. Here, we present a tandem catalysis system capable of achieving complete conversion of abundant urea into compound fertilizer in industrial&#8208;scale reactors by combining electrochemical and subsequent chemical processes. In a typical cycle, with the use of 200&#8197;g urea, 1580&#8197;g of solid compound fertilizer (KH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4) and 232&#8197;L of pure H2 are produced without any further separation process. The key to the realization of this system is to precisely control the rate of urea consumption and NO2&#8722; formation in electrochemical process. By maintaining a precise molar concentration ratio of urea to NO2&#8722; at 1/2 in electrolyte, urea can completely react with NO2&#8722; to form N2, while CNO&#8722; can be converted into NH4+ to form compound fertilizer in the second step of H3PO4 treatment, achieving complete conversion of urea without by&#8208;products formation. This method remarkably reduces H2 production potential while allowing for extraction of ammonia from urea&#8208;containing wastewater or urine to create pure compound fertilizer at an anticipated lower price than that of current market.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Catalytic Sites Grafting on 2D&#8208;Metal Oxides for Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>

Implementing 2D&#8208;nanocofined metal atomic&#8208;site grafting strategy, involving the thermal conversion of catalyst precursor loaded single metal hydroxide layer within silica bilayer envelope, produced the high density single atomic catalytic sites stably and homogeneously embedded on isolated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin metal oxide nanosheets, which demonstrated outperforming activity in catalyzing acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Installing well&#8208;defined high density single&#8208;atomic catalyst (SAC) sites is highly desired for the synergistic cooperative effect in efficient chemical synthesis but elusive to synthesize due to unavoidable atomic segregation into clusters or particulates. We implemented a 2D&#8208;nanoconfined SAC grafting strategy. Inside a bilayer silica envelope, single metal hydroxide layer, pre&#8208;loaded with the catalytic metal (Pt, Pd, Ir) precursors, underwent controlled thermal conversion to the homogeneously embedded SACs decorated onto the in&#8197;situ generated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheet. Ultranarrow confined slit&#8208;space exclusively availed laterally emerging cation vacancies of TMO host, as atomic scale sockets to capture SACs within 2D&#8208;plane while vertically restricting the atomic aggregation into nanoparticulates. High density SACs stably decorated on isolated TMO nanosheet, could be obtained in a controllable manner. Well&#8208;defined SACs on TMO were conveniently employed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of a variety of alcohols with quite high activities outperforming reported catalysts. In&#8208;depth, mechanistic investigation revealed the dramatic enhancement in acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction rates by following distinct reaction pathways (concerted or stepwise) depending on the density of SACs cooperativity effect. Such advantageous effect is distinct from the reactions on isolated metal sites in low&#8208;density SACs or nanoparticle surface.

&lt;p&gt;Installing well-defined high density single-atomic catalyst (SAC) sites is highly desired for the synergistic cooperative effect in efficient chemical synthesis but elusive to synthesize due to unavoidable atomic segregation into clusters or particulates. We implemented a 2D-nanoconfined SAC grafting strategy. Inside a bilayer silica envelope, single metal hydroxide layer, pre-loaded with the catalytic metal (Pt, Pd, Ir) precursors, underwent controlled thermal conversion to the homogeneously embedded SACs decorated onto the in&#8197;situ generated 1&#8197;nm-thin transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheet. Ultranarrow confined &lt;i&gt;slit-space&lt;/i&gt; exclusively availed laterally emerging cation vacancies of TMO host, as atomic scale sockets to capture SACs within 2D-plane while vertically restricting the atomic aggregation into nanoparticulates. High density SACs stably decorated on isolated TMO nanosheet, could be obtained in a controllable manner. Well-defined SACs on TMO were conveniently employed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of a variety of alcohols with quite high activities outperforming reported catalysts. In-depth, mechanistic investigation revealed the dramatic enhancement in acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction rates by following distinct reaction pathways (concerted or stepwise) depending on the density of SACs cooperativity effect. Such advantageous effect is distinct from the reactions on isolated metal sites in low-density SACs or nanoparticle surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Selectively Activated Aromatic Rings for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The Co&#8208;NTTA MOF (NTTA=5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings in diverse chemical environments, is synthesized as the high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate Li&#8208;ion battery anode. Both the NTTA ligands and Co cations participate in a 51&#8208;electron reversible redox reaction. The &#8220;structure&#8208;property&#8221; relationship is deeply elucidated, and for the first time, selective activation of different aromatic rings within a single MOF has been revealed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising candidates for anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their designable structure, abundant active sites, and well&#8208;organized porosity. However, the structural factors governing active site utilization and Li&#8208;ion storage kinetics remain inadequately understood. In particular, the Li&#8208;ion storage behaviors of aromatic rings with high LUMO energy levels and situated in varying chemical environments remain a highly debated issue. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;based MOF (Co&#8208;NTTA, NTTA ligand: 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings situated in diverse local environments, is deliberately designed and synthesized. Experimental characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations have verified the occurrence of a reversible electrochemical reaction involving a total of 51 electrons among the NTTA ligands, cobalt cations, and Li+ ions. Unlike the traditional concept of superlithiation, the three inner aromatic rings are selectively activated by &#960;&#8208;aromatic conjugation networks and &#960;

&#960; stacking, contributing to a reversible 6&#8208;electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. Conversely, the three outer aromatic rings remain inert toward Li+ ions. Impressively, the Co&#8208;NTTA MOF anode, with selectively activated aromatic rings, delivers a reversible capacity of up to 956&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates exceptional high&#8208;rate durability, further supporting a 4.3&#8197;V lithium&#8208;ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor with high energy/power density.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Syngas over Nanoparticle&#8208;Derived Bifunctional Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst that exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in the single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether reaction. Comprehensive results obtained from HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, and in&#8197;situ UHV&#8208;FTIRS demonstrate the formation of highly dispersed Pd clusters/particles confined on a nanoparticulate ceria matrix with interfacial Pd2+ sites, accounting for the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether (STD) process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial process that utilizes Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. Here, we report a highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, in which Pd colloids dispersed in a nanoscale CeO2 matrix serve as the key building block for the methanol&#8208;active component, efficiently catalysing the STD reaction. For Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 with a high Pd&#8208;CeO2 interface concentration, CO conversion and dimethyl ether yield are significantly increased compared to Pd supported on Al2O3. Systematic investigations using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques reveal the formation of highly dispersed palladium clusters/particles confined within the nanoparticulate CeO2 matrix. The superior catalytic performance in both activity and stability observed for the Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 in the STD reaction stems from the active cationic palladium interfacial species and the presence of adjacent O vacancies.

         <title>Achieving Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution Phase from Carbon Dots Confined in Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation method is firstly developed to encapsulate citrate&#8208;derived carbon dots into NaYF4 nanocrystals, which protects the triplet excitons of carbon dots from quenching and provides a stable environment for room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in solution phase.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted growing interest in the construction of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. However, in the solution phase of CDs, it is still challenging to obtain efficient and stable phosphorescent emission due to the intense quenching effect by dissolved oxygen and solvent molecules. Herein, we report robust phosphorescence in the solution phase, achieved by encapsulating citrate&#8208;derived CDs into NaYF4 nanocrystals via a one&#8208;step method of high&#8208;temperature coprecipitation. Combined characterizations show that the triplet emission from CDs is related to the abundance of C=O in the CDs, the formation of ionic&#8208;bond networks around the CDs, and the spatial confinement and quenching inhibition effects of NaYF4 nanocrystals. Notably, the transition of CDs@NaYF4 from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity can be easily achieved by simple surface modulation of NaYF4 nanocrystals, which allows the RTP of CDs to be maintained in either polar or nonpolar solvents. In addition, CDs@NaYF4 exhibits stable afterglow in different pH environments, suggesting its excellent stability. Finally, we demonstrated the application of CDs@NaYF4 in 3D printing, oily anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns, and cell imaging. Our work can serve the controllable preparation of solution&#8208;phase RTP materials and their various applications.

         <title>Helically Chiral Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems Comprising N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes: Stabilization of the Cationic Species by &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[5]Helicene&#8208;bridged dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulenes were synthesized. Their successive oxidation allowed the study of the electronic coupling between the nitrogen centers. The radical cation with its strong coupling is a Class III mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer system. The dication exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character. The cationic species display strong Cotton effects extending up to 2000&#8197;nm in circular dichroism spectra.







Abstract
We report the efficient stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cations in a dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulene bridged by a rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated [5]helicene backbone (NTH). The rigid scaffold exhibits helical chirality, allowing the enantiomers to be separated and their chiroptical properties studied, including circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Successive oxidation towards the radical cation NTH&#8901;+ and dication NTH2+ reveals strong electronic communication between the two nitrogen&#8208;centers, as demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, electrochemistry, UV/Vis/nIR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. CD measurements of the enantiomerically pure cations reveal strong Cotton effects in the nIR region extending up to 2000&#8197;nm. Density functional theory confirms the observed enhanced electronic communication, classifying NTH&#8901;+ as a Robin&#8208;Day Class III mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer (MV&#8211;CT) system.

&lt;p&gt;[5]Helicene-bridged dimeric &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterotriangulenes were synthesized. Their successive oxidation allowed the study of the electronic coupling between the nitrogen centers. The radical cation with its strong coupling is a Class III mixed-valence charge-transfer system. The dication exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character. The cationic species display strong Cotton effects extending up to 2000&#8197;nm in circular dichroism spectra.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the efficient stabilization of nitrogen-centered radical cations in a dimeric &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterotriangulene bridged by a rigid &#960;-conjugated [5]helicene backbone (&lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;). The rigid scaffold exhibits helical chirality, allowing the enantiomers to be separated and their chiroptical properties studied, including circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Successive oxidation towards the radical cation &lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and dication &lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reveals strong electronic communication between the two nitrogen-centers, as demonstrated by X-ray crystallography, electrochemistry, UV/Vis/nIR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. CD measurements of the enantiomerically pure cations reveal strong Cotton effects in the nIR region extending up to 2000&#8197;nm. Density functional theory confirms the observed enhanced electronic communication, classifying &lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a Robin-Day Class III mixed-valence charge-transfer (MV&#8211;CT) system. &lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a quinoidal structure with partial diradical character and open-shell singlet ground state, as shown by variable temperature EPR measurements. Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy shows the photo-induced generation of &lt;b&gt;NTH&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Stability Na&#8208;Ion Layered Mn&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fire&#8208;new &#8220;intrinsic distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion&#8221; mechanism in Na&#8208;ion layered Mn&#8208;rich oxides, that is, counteracting the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon electrochemical cycling by introducing intrinsic structural distortion during the material synthesis due to their opposite deformation orientations, is unveiled to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of the cathodes.







Abstract
Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) distortion of Mn3+ always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials. Herein, we unveil the &#8220;intrinsic distortion against J&#8208;T distortion&#8221; mechanism to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of LMRO cathodes. The intrinsic distortion simply constructed by introducing bulk oxygen vacancies is systematically confirmed by advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, atomic&#8208;scale imaging characterizations, and theoretical computations, which can counteract the J&#8208;T distortion during cycling due to their opposite deformation orientations. This greatly decreases and uniformizes the lattice strain within the ab plane and along the c axis of the material, thereby alleviating the P2&#8208;P&#8242;2 phase transition as well as suppressing the edge dislocation and intragranular crack formation upon repeated cycles. As a result, the tailored P2&#8208;Na0.72Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode featuring intrinsic distortion delivers a considerably enhanced cycling durability (91.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles) without sacrificing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox capacity (186.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;C). This intrinsic distortion engineering paves a brand&#8208;new and prospective avenue toward achieving high&#8208;performance LMRO cathodes for SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Layered manganese-rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials.

         <title>Integrating Circular Polarized Luminescence and Long Persistent Luminescence in Cu8 Cage&#8208;Like Clusters via Ligand Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral cage&#8208;like Cu8&#8722;Cl clusters integrating circular polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) were successfully achieved via a stepwise ligand engineering approach. These are the first copper clusters to demonstrate both CPL and LPL properties, as well as the longest luminescent lifetime observed in copper clusters. This study emphasizes the importance of surface ligands in shaping the desired luminescent properties.







Abstract
Copper clusters with diverse luminescent properties are of particular interest. In this study, a series of Cu8 clusters with cage&#8208;like structures was synthesized and characterized. By employing a stepwise ligand engineering strategy that progressively introduced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties, we successfully synthesized R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl, the first copper cluster to demonstrate both CPL and LPL. The CPL originates from the chiral metal core induced by the chiral alkynyl ligand, whereas the LPL is attributed to the inherent properties of chlorine&#8208;modified triphenylphosphine, which is retained and modified after ligation. The polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film containing Cu8 clusters displays lifetimes of up to 75.18&#8197;ms at room temperature and an afterglow exceeding 1.5&#8197;s, marking the longest luminescent lifetime recorded for molecular copper&#8208;cluster&#8208;based materials known to date. Additionally, R/S&#8208;Cu8&#8722;Cl shows excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence and variations in luminescence when UV light is switched on and off, highlighting its potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. This work not only presents innovative cage&#8208;like copper cluster structures but also offers new approaches for designing multifunctional clusters.

         <title>Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal pulse sintering is proposed to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) binder by converting carboxyl groups into ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8208;). This process produces uniform binder coatings on LiCoO2, forming protective layers and enhancing charge carrier pathways for high&#8208;voltage operation, paving the way for scalable and cost&#8208;effective multifunctional binder development.







Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water&#8208;soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 (93&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles). This strategy facilitates the decomposition of electrochemically active carboxyl groups, leading to ring opening reactions that generate numerous ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8208;) without introducing undesirable side effects on LiCoO2. The resulting components form additional charge carrier (i.e., Li+ and e&#8722;) pathways on the cathode surface. Additionally, the heating process also promotes uniform coating of the binder on the surface of LiCoO2, creating a protective layer that inhibits interfacial side reactions. Through proposing a scalable and economic manufacturing technology of multifunctional binder, this work enlightens the avenues for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Using &#8220;Porous Water&#8221; for High&#8208;purity Carbon Monoxide Electrosynthesis from Dilute Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous electrolyte with high CO2 physical adsorption capacity, was constructed to continuously produce high&#8208;purity CO from dilute CO2. Interfacial CO2 concentration gradient drives the spontaneously desorption of CO2 under reductive potential, excluding other gaseous species in product stream. Combined high CO2 concentration and surface exchange between K ions and Si&#8208;OH, gives continuous production of CO with purity of 97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% from 15&#8201;% CO2.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of high&#8208;purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) remains energy&#8208;intensive due to the unavoidable CO2 regeneration and post&#8208;purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high&#8208;purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on &#8220;porous water&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt;Porous electrolyte with high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; physical adsorption capacity, was constructed to continuously produce high-purity CO from dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Interfacial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration gradient drives the spontaneously desorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under reductive potential, excluding other gaseous species in product stream. Combined high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and surface exchange between K ions and Si-OH, gives continuous production of CO with purity of 97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% from 15&#8201;% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrosynthesis of high-purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) remains energy-intensive due to the unavoidable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regeneration and post-purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high-purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on &#8220;porous water&#8221;. Zeolite nanocrystals within PE provide permanent pores in the liquid phase, enabling physical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption through an intraparticle diffusion model, as demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations and in situ spectral analysis. Captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; spontaneously desorbs under applied reductive potential, driven by the interfacial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration gradient, and is subsequently reduced electrochemically. The high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in PE enhances mass transfer, and surface ion exchange between Si&#8722;OH groups and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions on the zeolite surface generates a stronger interfacial electric field, promoting electron transfer steps. This optimized kinetics for mass and electron transfer confers heightened intrinsic activity toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. The PE-based electrolysis system demonstrated superior CO Faradaic efficiency and partial current density compared to the conventional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fed system. A circular system using PE and a Ni&#8722;N/C cathode realized continuous production of high-purity CO (97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) from dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (15&#8201;%) and maintained &amp;gt;90.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% under 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with significantly reduced energy consumption and costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Li&#8722;CO2 Battery Performance via High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts: Insights into Configurational Entropy Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) values supported on carbon nanofibers were designed to serve as the cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, demonstrating a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries have attracted considerable attention for their ability to combine CO2 fixation and conversion with high&#8208;density energy storage. However, sluggish kinetics of CO2 reduction and evolution reactions at cathodes lead to large overpotentials and poor cyclic stability. To address this issue, it is critical to develop advanced cathode catalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of catalysts, have exhibited exceptional catalytic activities in various electrochemical reactions. Nevertheless, the intrinsic relationship between mix configurational entropy (&#9653;Smix) and catalytic properties of HEAs remains unclear. Herein, we prepared a series of quinary FeCoNiCuRu alloys with different &#9653;Smix values supported on carbon nanofibers as cathode catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. Experimental and computational results reveal a positive correlation between &#9653;Smix and catalytic activity, attributed to charge redistribution among elements with different electronegativities. The Li&#8722;CO2 battery using the alloy catalyst with the maximum &#9653;Smix value delivers the largest capacity of 6160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, the lowest charge potential plateau below 4.0&#8197;V, and remarkable cycling stability (550&#8197;cycles/5500&#8197;h), surpassing most reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, fabrication of pouch cells with low noble metal loading demonstrates the practical potential of HEAs for Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. This work provides insights into high&#8208;entropy engineering for advanced electrocatalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, safe mechanochemical method for hydrogenation and dehalogenation is presented. Using catalyst&#8208;plated vessels and H2 gas, various functional groups are efficiently reduced at ambient conditions. Alkenes and alkynes are fully hydrogenated in 20&#8197;min (&gt;99&#8201;% yield). Carbonyls are converted to alcohols (95&#8211;99&#8201;% yield), while nitro groups are reduced to amines (&gt;95&#8201;% yield). Dehalogenation of chloro&#8208;, bromo&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;compounds proceeds efficiently. Choice of catalyst and reaction conditions enable chemoselective transformations. This versatile approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable system for hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O, as well as N&#8722;O and C&#8722;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5&#8197;bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Transient Dangling Active Sites of Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced theoretical modeling unveils that, under working conditions of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, the Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) undergoes potential&#8208;dependent structural evolution, which transiently generates a novel type of dangling active site that is the key to its superior activity, shedding new light on the design of highly active SACs.







Abstract
The Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with an oxidation state of III anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C) delivers superior activity for catalyzing the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce CO, but its mechanism remains contentious and the commonly adopted FeN4&#8208;C model is not a conformant model for Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C but for Fe(II)&#8722;N&#8722;C. Herein, employing the grand&#8208;canonical ensemble modeling with the density functional theory method benchmarked against the high&#8208;level wavefunction theory method, we first identify the conformant model for Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C to be FeN1C3&#8208;C, and we then unveil that the Fe(III)N1C3&#8208;C SAC generates a novel type of dangling active site transiently under working conditions, in which the Fe single&#8208;atom leaves from the anchoring site by breaking all the Fe&#8722;C bonds but retains a stable binding to the substrate by the Fe&#8722;N bond. Thus, we further elucidate that this flexible dangling active site of Fe(III)&#8722;N&#8722;C renders a convoluted reaction network with facile CO2 activation, which delivers superior activity for eCO2RR. Our findings provide a novel understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and concrete insights into the design of highly active SACs.

&#8220;Ne te lave pas, j'arrive.&#8221; No work&#8208;up or purification required! Cheap robotics&#8208;based high throughput synthesis of crude reactions mixtures, married to high throughput X&#8208;Ray crystallography, leads to savings in time, energy and solvent use, and was applied to fragment elaboration vs the atypical bromodomain PHIP(2). Overall, &gt;1800 reactions were performed in a few weeks and 22 crystal structures were solved showing that binding can be detected on even weak fragments, with 3 showing an unexpected binding pose. A final compound displayed acceptable binding to the bromodomain (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Fragment approaches are long&#8208;established in target&#8208;based ligand discovery, yet their full transformative potential lies dormant because progressing the initial weakly binding hits to potency remains a formidable challenge. The only credible progression paradigm involves multiple cycles of costly conventional design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyse medicinal chemistry. We propose an alternative approach to fragment elaboration, namely performing large numbers of parallel and diverse automated multiple step reactions, and evaluating the binding of the crude reaction products by high&#8208;throughput protein X&#8208;ray crystallography. We show it is effective and low&#8208;cost to perform, in parallel, large numbers of non&#8208;uniform multi&#8208;step reactions, because, even without compound purification, crystallography provides a high&#8208;quality readout of binding. This can detect low&#8208;level binding of weakly active compounds, which the target binding site extracts directly from crude reaction mixtures. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we have expanded a fragment hit, from a crystal&#8208;based screen of the second bromodomain of pleckstrin homology domain&#8208;interacting protein (PHIP(2)), using array synthesis on low&#8208;cost robotics. We were able to implement 6 independent multi&#8208;step reaction routes of up to 5 steps, attempting the synthesis of 1876 diverse expansions, designs entirely driven by synthetic tractability. The expected product was present in 1108 (59%) crude reaction mixtures, detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). 22 individual products were resolved in the crystal structures of crude reaction mixtures added to crystals, providing an initial structure activity relationship map. 19 of these showed binding pose stability, while, through binding instability in the remaining 3 products, we could resolve a stereochemical preference for mixtures containing racemic compounds. One compound showed biochemical potency (IC50=34&#8197;&#956;M) and affinity (Kd=50&#8197;&#956;M) after resynthesis. This approach therefore lends itself to routine fragment progression, if coupled with algorithmically guided compound and reaction design and new formalisms for data analysis.

         <title>Giant Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a Chiral Polar Crystal based on Helical One&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical 1D lead halide perovskites crystallized in the polar C2 space group demonstrate strong circular dichroism and achieve an extraordinary 15&#8197;V open&#8208;circuit voltage via the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE). This work highlights low&#8208;dimensional crystal symmetry engineering as a transformative approach for designing high&#8208;performance BPVE materials.







Abstract
Chiral polar crystals composed of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) conducting materials exhibit unique physical phenomena. The present study focused on helical 1D&#8208;structured lead halide perovskite derivatives with chiral naphthylethylamine as organic cations, (R or S&#8208;NEA)[PbI3](R&#8208;NEA=R&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine, S&#8208;NEA=S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine). A thermally controlled crystallization method has successfully yielded crystals with a polar chiral space group of C2. The crystals show significantly intense signals of circular dichroism (CD) originating from the asymmetrical electronic transition characteristic of helical 1D structure. In addition, generation of an anomalous zero&#8208;bias photocurrent (bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)) was observed with an open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 15&#8197;V, which is five times larger than the band gap. This study suggests that parallel arrangements of the helical semiconducting materials are the promising way to obtain chiral polar crystal exhibiting high performance BPVE.

         <title>Creation of Dopant&#8208;Plasmon Synergism in Double Perovskites for Bias&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

Lead&#8208;free Cs2AgCuBiBr6 perovskite with body&#8208;embedded Ag nanoparticles synergistically improve the utilization efficiency of photogenerated carrier and the adsorption and oxidation of Br&#8722;, ensuring the high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of bromohydrins and H2O2 in an unbiased photoelectrochemical system.







Abstract
The integration of photoexcited charge carriers into the synthesis of valuable chemicals offers substantial sustainability benefits, particularly by replacing toxic and costly oxidants and reductants typically used in conventional processes. The efficiency of such transformations is fundamentally governed by the ability to optimize light absorption and charge carrier dynamics within photoelectrodes/photocatalysts. Herein, we present a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;substituted double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 photoanode, embedded with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles, for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical production of bromohydrins and H2O2. Spectroscopic analyses, coupled with three&#8208;dimensional finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations, demonstrate that the inclusion of Ag nanoparticles significantly enhances electromagnetic energy utilization and improves carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the Cu2+ and Ag nanoparticles results in a 7&#8208;fold increase in the yield of 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol, compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6, alongside an impressive H2O2 productivity of 25.8&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu2+ substitution strengthens Br&#8722; adsorption and oxidation, promoting the bromohydroxylation of alkenes via electrophilic addition in the bulk solution. These findings offer critical insights into the design of advanced metal halide perovskites for sustainable and solar&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Identical Grain Atomic Force Microscopy Elucidates Facet&#8208;Dependent Restructuring of Copper for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron backscatter diffraction is uniquely combined with identical grain atomic force microscopy to successfully elucidate the surface topography of different Cu facets for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction. The statistic slope distribution function is introduced to quantify the topography to link the asymmetry of the surface restructuring. From this analysis, surface restructuring varies based on crystal facets, which inherit their original facet structure.







Abstract
Studies on the catalyst restructuring during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) are limited and mostly focused on Cu (001) or (111) single crystals as model systems. A comprehensive overview of the dynamic restructuring of different Cu facets is lacking. Here, we first reveal the facet&#8208;dependent restructuring of polycrystalline Cu electrodes through electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and identical grain atomic force microscopy (AFM). This combined analysis provides new insights into the evolution of crystal domains (EBSD) and surface topography (AFM) at varying conditions (e.g., applied potential and oxidative&#8208;reductive pulses). The statistic slope distribution function was applied to study the restructuring asymmetry on five Cu facets (i.e., planar vs. atom stepped). We find that planar Cu (001) shows a square&#8208;shaped morphology after eCO2RR with 4&#8208;fold asymmetry restructuring behavior, while triangular features dominate on Cu (111), evidenced by surface changes with 3&#8208;fold asymmetry. 2&#8208;fold restructuring is observed for Cu (114), (212), and (124) with atom steps, resulting in forming elongated structures. Therefore, the surface restructuring is dominated by the asymmetry of its facet lattice structure (i.e., planar vs. atom&#8208;stepped). This work underscores the potential of combining techniques to elucidate the relationship between surface restructuring and crystal facets on different length scales.

         <title>Practical High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by the In&#8208;Situ Fabrication of Main&#8208;Chain Fluorinated Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte that integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether (FEOP) was developed, enabling the practical 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells with an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes are crucial for advancing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. Therefore, such electrolytes must possess stability with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal, ensuring efficient interfacial contact and high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity. In this study, we present a novel main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte, FEOP, synthesized through cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization. FEOP integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether, achieving an oxidation potential of up to 5.6&#8197;V and an anion&#8208;involved solvation structure. The exceptional stability enables NCM811 cells to deliver an impressive cycling life of 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;C up to 4.5&#8197;V. Furthermore, at ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.7 and 4.9&#8197;V, both NCM811 and LNMO cells demonstrate stable cycling over 700 cycles, marking the longest lifespan for polymer&#8208;based batteries under these challenging conditions. Moreover, 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells incorporating FEOP exhibit an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles, while successfully passing industry&#8208;standard nail penetration tests. Moreover, FEOP demonstrate excellent compatibility with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading electrode (70&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), achieving an exceptional areal capacity of 16.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These results provide a solid foundation for designing practical electrolytes that enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Inverse Electron Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc): Reactivity and Reversibility Enable Chemical Separation of Metallofullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@Ih&#8208;C80 (M=Lu, Sc) has been utilized to yield [5,6]&#8208;closed [4+2] cycloadducts that were fully characterized (HPLC, MS, UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and DFT calculations). The unique reactivity and thermal reversibility of endohedral metallofullerenes enable an efficient separation strategy, thereby advancing scalable synthesis for future applications.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes are chemically more inert compared to empty fullerenes, primarily due to their intramolecular electron transfer. In this work, we report an inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction on M3N@C80 (M=Lu, Sc), where they show significantly higher reactivity than empty fullerenes. The molecular structures of the [4+2] cycloadducts were unambiguously characterized. Moreover, the cycloadducts can fully revert to pristine M3N@C80 via retro&#8208;cycloaddition upon thermal treatment. With the unusual reactivity and reversibility, the IEDDA reaction enables an effective separation approach for metallofullerenes from their soot extracts, opening path to efficient and economical scale&#8208;up synthesis of metallofullerenes in laboratory and industrial settings.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Photothermal Agents: A Universal Platform for Smart Immune NIR&#8208;Agonists for Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

Our research presents a versatile platform for developing photoimmunotherapy agents that selectively activate immunogenic cell death in tumor cells upon NIR light irradiation, priming an effective anti&#8208;tumor immune response.







Abstract
Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing off&#8208;target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather than commonly non&#8208;immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein, we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting capability and potent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR&#8208;controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner. Moreover, both ER&#8208;targeting and NIR&#8208;activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti&#8208;tumor immunity, minimizing off&#8208;target effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors. This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and effective immune NIR&#8208;agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse solid tumors.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization from Monomer Mixtures to Synthesize Oxygen&#8208;Rich Block Copolymers with Dual Recyclability and Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable polymerization from mixtures of epoxide congeners can yield oxygenated block copolymers with diverse functionality, yet remains unexplored due to similar reactivities. Here, well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers were synthesized via switchable process from mixtures of terminal epoxides/internal epoxides/o&#8208;phthalaldehyde/CO2. The copolymers, with acid/base labile properties, enable sequence&#8208;controlled depolymerization.







Abstract
Switchable catalysis from monomer mixtures has been emerging as a powerful technique to synthesize various useful block copolymers, yet represents a significant challenge in polymer chemistry. Herein, we present the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers through switchable polymerization from mixtures of terminal epoxides, internal epoxides, o&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) and CO2. The exclusive chemoselectivity of terminal epoxide or internal epoxide was achieved by controlling the reaction atmosphere. The dynamic equilibrium of acetal anion and alkoxy anion is the key to the successful switch from terminal epoxides/OPA copolymerization to internal epoxides/CO2 copolymerization. Computational studies elucidated the kinetic and thermodynamic preferences underlying this selective polymerization. The acid/base labile nature of the block copolymers enables their sequence&#8208;controlled chemical recycling/degradation. These novel polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers with facilely sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization/depolymerization capabilities will enable their further tailored applications and contribute to the development of a circular plastic economy.

         <dc:description>
The Zr6 cluster in MOFs exhibits diverse connectivity (3&#8211;12), yet the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF remained elusive. Using a geometric preassembly strategy, the rare 7&#8208;connected Zr6&#8208;cluster MOFs is synthesized, bridging this gap&#8208;akin to discovering new elements in the periodic table.

Zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) exhibit a wide range of Zr6 cluster connectivities, from 3&#8208;connected to 12&#8208;connected, enabling diverse structural designs. However, odd&#8208;numbered connectivities, especially the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOFs, are exceptionally rare due to geometric symmetry challenges. To address this, we developed a geometric pre&#8208;assembly strategy to achieve targeted cluster connectivity. Using this approach, we synthesized NU&#8208;5001 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L)2]}, a Zr&#8208;MOF featuring 7&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters, derived from the precursor 6&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF, NU&#8208;5000 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H3&#8208;L)2]}. NU&#8208;5000, constructed with a tritopic chiral linker H3&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[6&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6&#8208;triyl]tribenzoic acid}, forms a (3,6)&#8208;connected ant topology. Introducing a tetratopic chiral linker, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol tetracarboxylic acid H4&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6,6&#8217;&#8208;tetrayl]tetrabenzoic acid}, enabled an additional connection, resulting in NU&#8208;5001 with a (3,4,7)&#8208;connected topology. The H4&#8208;L linker acts as either fully 4&#8208;connected or 3&#8208;connected with one arm uncoordinated. Additionally, NU&#8208;5001M {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L) (H3&#8208;L)]}, an isostructural variant, was synthesized using a mix of H3&#8208;L and H4&#8208;L linkers. NU&#8208;5001&#8217;s unique pore structure and slight flexibility enable distinct adsorption behaviors for hexane isomers, highlighting its potential for kinetic separations. This work completes the Zr6 cluster connectivity landscape and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning Zr&#8208;MOF connectivities through rational linker design, paving the way for rare, low&#8208;symmetry frameworks with tailored properties.

&lt;p&gt;The Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cluster in MOFs exhibits diverse connectivity (3&#8211;12), yet the 7-connected Zr-MOF remained elusive.

         <title>Engineering the Catalytic Superlattices for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage with A high Compositional Conversion Degree</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

The MoS2/M&#8208;ONG (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) superlattice is constructed by 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces. The catalytic interface achieves excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics. During the discharge process, the conductivity and Na+ transport are enhanced through the S&#8722;M&#8722;O bond. In the charging process, the interface boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by single&#8208;atom Co catalyst.







Abstract
A major obstacle of transition metal disulfides in sodium&#8208;ion batteries is compositional irreversible conversion, leading to fast capacity decay. Here, we propose to engineer a catalytic superlattice structure for achieving a record&#8208;high compositional reversible conversion degree (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The superlattice is constructed by alternately stacking MoS2 layers and nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal layers (MoS2/M&#8208;ONG SL, M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces, in which the metal atoms bridge the two layers through S&#8722;M&#8208;O chemical bonds. Using MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL as a model, the unique superlattice structure shows excellent electron and Na+ transport properties during discharge and charge. Moreover, the Co&#8208;ONG boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by forming Co&#8208;3d and S&#8208;3p hybridization. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL shows a high compositional reversible conversion degree(&#8776;100&#8201;%), as proven by a series of in&#8208;/ex situ spectroscopic analyses. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL exhibits a stable cycling stability of 300.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an ultrasmall capacity decay rate of 0.41&#8201;% per 100&#8197;cycles. This work offers a noteworthy perspective on the design and fabrication of conversion&#8208;type materials, emphasizing the crucial role of interface engineering in achieving excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics.

         <title>&#8216;Tearing Effect&#8217; of Alloy&#8211;Support Interaction for Alloy Redispersion in NiRu/TiO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; of alloy&#8208;support interaction on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles, where the NiRu nanoparticles on the interface redisperse to smaller ones like to be torn apart.







Abstract
Supported alloy catalysts have been extensively applied to many significant industrial chemical processes due to the abundant active sites with distinguishable geometry and electron states. However, a detailed in situ investigation of the interaction between support and alloy nanoparticles is still lacking. Here, a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles is in situ discovered by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) with a dramatic redispersion process of alloy nanoparticles from ~25&#8197;nm to 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm under the repeated hydrogen reduction. Dual&#8208;driven by the distinct alloy&#8208;support interaction involving the restructuring of alloy nanoparticles and growth of TiOx overlayer, larger NiRu alloy nanoparticles spontaneously disintegrate into atoms migrating on support. Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO2 during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy&#8208;support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal&#8208;support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure&#8208;performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Robust Fully Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Synergistic Ostwald Ripening</title>

Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells. We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. The fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits an efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency.







Abstract
Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the controllable crystallization in screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films using high&#8208;viscosity ionic liquids has been suggested to be difficult, which hampers further development of fully screen&#8208;printed perovskite devices in terms of application expansion and performance improvement. Here, we report a synergistic ripening strategy to fully control crystallization by employing methylamine propionate (MAPa) ionic liquid and water (H2O, moisture in the air). We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. MAPa effectively prevents the loss of organic salts and maintains the dispersion of Pb&#8208;I framework, preventing the perovskite component loss and decomposition. H2O and organic salts trends to form hydration complexes, which lowers the energy barrier and enhances the reactivity of the humidity&#8208;induced Ostwald ripening reaction. These improvements allow the screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films achieve controlled secondary growth and ion exchange, thereby reducing defects and optimizing energy level alignment. The resulting fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits a record power conversion efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

MAPa effectively prevents the loss of organic salts and maintains the dispersion of Pb-I framework, preventing the perovskite component loss and decomposition. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and organic salts trends to form hydration complexes, which lowers the energy barrier and enhances the reactivity of the humidity-induced Ostwald ripening reaction. These improvements allow the screen-printed perovskite thin films achieve controlled secondary growth and ion exchange, thereby reducing defects and optimizing energy level alignment. The resulting fully screen-printed PSCs exhibits a record power conversion efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency under continuous light stress at maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Patternable and Healable Polymer Semiconductor Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Disulfide Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing functions have been successfully integrated into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor with relatively high charge mobility for the first time, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups. The results show that thin film of P3 exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast of 1.2. Moreover, the scratched patterned thin films can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored.







Abstract
Apart from charge transport property, polymer semiconductors with patternable and healable functions are highly demanding for the fabrication of organic circuits. Herein, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups, we successfully integrate photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing capabilities into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor for the first time. The results show that the thin film of DPP&#8208;based conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with TA groups in the side chains exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365&#8197;nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity (S) of 210&#8197;mJ&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and contrast (&#947;) of 1.2. Importantly, the patterning process has minimal impact on thin film morphology, interchain stacking, and charge transport mobility. Moreover, the patterned thin films, which were initially scratched, can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored. In comparison, the scratched thin film of PDPP4T without TA groups in the side chains achieves only 82.6&#8201;% recovery of scratch depth and 54.5&#8201;% recovery of charge mobility under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing multifunctional polymer semiconductors by incorporating TA groups in the side chains, offering a new pathway to lithography&#8208;compatible, self&#8208;healing smart flexible devices.

         <title>Redirecting On&#8208;surface Cycloaddition Reactions in a Self&#8208;assembled Ordered Molecular Array on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis on chemically inert substrates via thermal activation is extremely challenging in ultra&#8208;high vacuum, suffering from a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221;. Here, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition via dehydrohalogenations in a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled molecular array on graphite, where the cycloaddition products are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries) even with productivities over 30&#8201;%.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise carbon nanostructures in ultra&#8208;high vacuum has seen extensive progress on metal surfaces. However, this remains challenging on chemically inert surfaces. It is because the thermally activated C&#8722;C coupling encounters a severe &#8220;desorption problem&#8221; on weakly interacting substrates. In this study, we report an extraordinary [2+2]+[2+2] cycloaddition triggered by mild annealing (~210&#176;C) in a highly ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular array on graphite using scanning tunneling microscopy. In contrast to irregular dendritic fragments typically obtained on metal substrates, large supramolecular islands are observed here with cycloaddition products and other polymers over 30&#8201;%, which are embedded as defective individuals or chains (grain boundaries). First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the energy barriers of the multiple dehydrohalogenation and cycloaddition reactions are reduced by catalytic Fe atoms but remain energetically unfavorable. A distinct driving mechanism is proposed for redirecting the reactions on graphite surface, where additional intermolecular coupling, steric hindrance, and interfacial interactions play significant roles. This study introduces a new paradigm for understanding on&#8208;surface synthesis on non&#8208;metal substrates.

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8722;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 composite catalyst was developed, leveraging the synergistic activation of Zn and MoS2 to optimize structure and electronic density. This significantly enhanced ORR/OER performance, achieving low overpotentials, ultra&#8208;high specific capacity, and long cycle life in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, demonstrating great potential for energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8722;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8722;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS2&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single&#8208;atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a post&#8208;deposition treatment process for Sb2Se3 solar cells. Upon this treatment, the P atoms from P2O5 not only passivate the defects in Sb2Se3 film but also bring (Sb4Se6)n ribbons closer together. This suppresses the carrier recombination and increases the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% for Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.







Abstract
Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as a post-deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep-level anti-site defect (Sb&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;) to a shallower defect (P&lt;sub&gt;Se&lt;/sub&gt;), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P-doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low-dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non-radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% in thermal evaporation derived Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep-level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low-dimensional solar cell materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Emissive Oligonucleotides Grafted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal and Gene Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA is utilized as both the amphiphilic and functional molecule to modify &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and efficient photothermal properties. The resulting nanoparticles show unique and advantageous properties, including higher NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, more efficient cytoplasm delivery, and higher tissue penetration, ultimately realizing well&#8208;performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided low&#8208;temperature PTT&#8208;gene combined therapy.







Abstract
In order to address the strong hydrophobicity and function limitation of NIR&#8208;II emissive phototheranostic &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), appropriate modifications are necessary to impart water dispersibility and functionality to CPs. This study uses DNA as the hydrophilic and functional unit to modify CPs, synthesizing CP&#8208;g&#8208;DNA amphiphilic copolymers and producing water&#8208;dispersible oligonucleotide&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer nanoparticles (OCPNs) by self&#8208;assembly. In addition to DNA&#8242;s gene regulation abilities that can combine with the low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy of CPs for enhanced tumor therapy, OCPNs display unique characteristics as novel nanomaterials. On one side, DNA changes the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and results in a two&#8208;fold enhancement in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, which greatly benefits tumor imaging. On the other side, DNA varies the surface properties of OCPNs and the nano&#8208;bio interactions. OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft&#8208;mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal&#8208;promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.

         <title>Spatially Separated Redox Centers in Anthraquinone&#8208;grafted Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the process of synergistic multi&#8208;reactions for hydrogen peroxide production, the directional transport of charge carriers is crucial. We present an anthraquinone&#8208;grafted UiO&#8208;66 with piezo&#8208;photocatalytic capabilities, which enables spatially separated redox reaction sites. This strategy of separating redox sites enhances the separation and utilization efficiency of charge carriers, providing a reliable approach for green energy and environmental technologies.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air is promising but its large&#8208;scale application is still challenging as insufficient reaction active sites and low reaction efficiency. We have applied molecular engineering methods to design an anthraquinone molecularly (AQ) grafted metal&#8211;organic framework piezo&#8208;photocatalyst (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ) for H2O2 generation from water and air. The catalyst achieves a peak H2O2 yield of 7872.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by facilitating two critical reactions: single&#8208;electron water oxidation (WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (ORR) on spatially separated redox sites. Experiments and computational simulations reveal efficient charge separation through a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;chain transfer mechanism. Electrons and holes are selectively transferred to AQ and UiO&#8208;66 promoting ORR and WOR under ultrasound and visible light. The high reaction rate of ORR (rapid generation of endoperoxide) compensates for the slow kinetics of WOR (generation of OH*) and greatly increases the rate of full&#8208;reaction of H2O2 production. Additionally, a continuous flow tubular reactor equipped with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;AQ catalytic membranes affords 96&#8201;% removal of organic dyes by a in situFenton process under visible light and water flow, confirming the significant potential of the catalyst for practical applications. This work deepens the understanding of directional carrier migration at piezo&#8208;photocatalytic spatial separation sites, opening new pathways for environmentally friendly and efficient H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>The Ratio of sp2 and sp3 Hybridized Carbon Determines the Performance of Carbon&#8208;based Catalysts in H2O2 Electrosynthesis from O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the field of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, carbon&#8208;based catalysts are widely adopted. Our statistical analysis connivingly reveals that the ratio of sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbon, rather than the widely believed oxygen functional groups, is the key structural property determining the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Introducing oxygen&#8208; or carbon&#8208;containing functional groups is a widely adopted strategy to optimize the performance of carbon&#8208;based catalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR). Nevertheless, the specific contributions of these functional groups to enhance activity and selectivity are not well&#8208;defined and continue under debate. In this study, we systematically modified carbon materials by controlling the contents of oxygen functional groups (OFGs) and carbon functional groups (CFGs). Surface compositions were accurately quantified using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR performance was evaluated using a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Through reliable statistical analyses, including partial least squares regression and linear regression, we explored the correlations between the surface compositional features &#8211; specifically the ratios of OFGs, CFGs, and sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon &#8211; and the catalytic performance metrics such as onset potential and H2O2 selectivity. Our findings challenge existing paradigms by demonstrating that the sp2/sp3 ratio is a critical factor in determining catalytic selectivity and a certain correlate with the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8201;ORR onset potential. By tuning this ratio, we achieved nearly 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity within 0.4&#8211;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and onset potential approached the thermodynamic potential (0.766&#8197;V vs. RHE for the O2/HO2&#8208; process), pointing a new direction in designing and developing advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable and Sequence&#8208;Controlled Aliphatic Polysulfones by Group Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical SO2&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of aliphatic polysulfones utilizing the strategy of group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) is disclosed. This novel method enables the precise construction of a diverse array of aliphatic polysulfones with ABC sequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement pathway plays a key role in the GTRP process. The obtained polymer exhibits optical properties that are comparable to those of commercially used polycarbonate. It also demonstrates complete degradability under strong basic conditions at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The incorporation of sulfur atoms into polymer backbones for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, such as aliphatic polysulfones, not only enhances degradability but also imparts many distinctive properties to these materials. Traditional synthetic methods encounter substantial challenges in achieving sequence&#8208;controlled aliphatic polysulfones with high molecular weights (MW), which significantly limits their applications. We report a novel approach for synthesizing aliphatic polysulfones using the strategy of sulfonyl radical&#8208;mediated group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP). This protocol employs a practical SO2&#8208;free pathway and produces a series of ABC sequence&#8208;defined high&#8208;MW polymers (up to 199.2&#8197;kg/mol). The resultant aliphatic polysulfone exhibits remarkable full&#8208;degradability at ambient temperature under strong basic conditions, and offers optical properties &#8211; including refractive index and Abbe number &#8211; comparable to those of commercially utilized polycarbonate. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to corroborate the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement mechanism implicated in the GTRP process.

&lt;p&gt;A practical SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free approach for the synthesis of aliphatic polysulfones utilizing the strategy of group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) is disclosed. This novel method enables the precise construction of a diverse array of aliphatic polysulfones with ABC sequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the non-desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement pathway plays a key role in the GTRP process. The obtained polymer exhibits optical properties that are comparable to those of commercially used polycarbonate. It also demonstrates complete degradability under strong basic conditions at ambient temperature.

A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis was developed. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. A perdeutero&#8208;arylation was also demonstrated, giving a polydeuterated heterocyclic compound with a quaternary carbon.







Abstract
A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis is described. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. Base&#8208;assisted cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis promoted a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of alkenes to afford deuterated alkenes via multiple repeating deuterium atom transfer/hydrogen atom abstraction processes, while consecutive reductive deuteration of alkenes proceeded in the absence of a base to afford polydeuterated alkanes. One&#8208;pot hydrogenative perdeuteration and perdeutero&#8208;arylation were also developed, providing access to various polydeuterated aliphatic compounds.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalysts Derived from Water&#8208;Induced Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Aerogel for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast transformation process and underlying formation mechanism of water&#8208;induced pure metal&#8211;organic framework aerogels are demonstrated. The derived edge&#8208;enriched oxygen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom nickel sites anchored on the defective carbon belts (a&#8208;Ni/DCBs) display excellent catalytic activity and durability toward electrochemical water oxidation, resulting from the optimized electronic structure and reduced thermodynamic energy barrier.







Abstract
Research on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) aerogels is relatively scarce, primarily constrained by the limited availability of synthetic methods. Herein, a water&#8208;induced rapid conversion process of MOF powder to MOF aerogel is demonstrated, where the macroscopic transition is essentially due to the reassembly of microscopic constituent units and the rapid alteration of morphological structure. The derived catalyst possesses abundant holes left by the acid leaching process, leading to the high enrichment of O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites on the concomitant carbon edges. Consequently, such a catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, only requiring a low overpotential of 279&#8197;mV to drive the benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the reduced OER energy barrier over the edge&#8208;enriched O&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom Ni sites, as compared with internal O&#8208;coordinated sites and traditional N&#8208;coordinated sites. This is primarily attributed to the optimization effect of distinctive O&#8208;coordinated structure and synergistic edge effect on the electronic structure of active Ni centers.

         <title>Unraveling the Essential Role of Consecutive Protonation Steps in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction when Using Au Nanorods in a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of Au nanorods not only improves the selectivity and production rate of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction but also provides crucial insights into the pivotal role of protonation steps and reaction intermediates, particularly highlighting the rate&#8208;determining *CO to *CHO conversion.







Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process (PCET) plays a crucial role in both natural and artificial photosynthesis, including CO2 fixation chemistry. However, difficulties in capturing the transient intermediates generated during the protonation process impede the clarification of the fundamental mechanism behind photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Herein, we report a general killing two birds with one stone strategy by spatially confining Au nanorods within a typical porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Interestingly, 2.4&#8208;fold increase in CH4/CO selectivity and 12&#8208;fold increase in CH4 production were observed after loading of Au nanorods, indicative of a strengthened protonation process in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. More importantly, the plasmonic effect from Au nanorods simultaneously boosted the in&#8197;situ Raman signals of *CO and *CHO intermediates on the Au&#8722;O&#8722;Zr active site. The evident protonation process was further clarified in a control H/D kinetic isotope experiment. This work highlights the significance of successive protonation steps for boosting CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Multifunctional Polymer Interphase with Fast Kinetics for Ultrahigh&#8208;rate Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinone polymer (PPPA) interphase with a planar and linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure can significantly boosts the performance of AZIBs. The expansion of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planes in PPPA molecules accelerates the transfer of intramolecular electrons during charge/discharge, which boosts the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, redistributes Zn2+ flux and facilitates diffusion of Zn2+. This results in dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;rate Zn deposition.







Abstract
Polymer interphase on Zn anodes obviates dendrite growth and significant side reactions including corrosion and hydrogen evolution in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), however has drawbacks of slow kinetics and large overpotential for Zn plating/stripping that prevent practical application especially under high&#8208;rate conditions. Here, a multifunctional polymer interphase with fast kineticsis reported, using poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) as an electrolyte additive. PPPA, with linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and enriched polar pyridine (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to form a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in situ. The PPPA SEI is efficient to block direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode, and regulate the interfacial solvation structure and Zn depostion. Importantly, the expanding &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of PPPA is shown to provide abundant 2D open channels for rapid Zn2+ transport, and the delocalized &#960; electrons form a space electrostatic field to facilitate de&#8208;solvation and diffusion of Zn2+. As a result, the Zn metal anode with PPPA/ZnSO4 electrolyte exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3 % at current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201; cm&#8722;2, and excellent cycle lifespan for over 2000 cycles (400&#8197;h) at current density 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and plating/stripping capacity of 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||MnO2 full battery exhibited a discharge capacity of 74.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at the current density of 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, demonstrating practical feasibility. It is concluded that judicious engineering of polymer additives and interphase will benefit the development of commercial AZIBs with fast kinetics for high&#8208;rate applications.

The Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full battery exhibited a discharge capacity of 74.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 5000 cycles at the current density of 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating practical feasibility. It is concluded that judicious engineering of polymer additives and interphase will benefit the development of commercial AZIBs with fast kinetics for high-rate applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exploring the High&#8208;Pressure Induced Abnormal Blueshift in MnS@CdS QDs: Unlocking New Mechanisms for Optoelectronic Applications







Abstract
Mn d&#8722;d emission has been a star transition&#8208;metal activated phosphors that were extensively used in optoelectronic devices. However, due to the complex and elusive luminescence mechanism, the full potential of this material remains largely untapped. Here, we designed a core&#8211;shell structure of MnS@CdS quantum dots (QDs) to investigate the effect of the internal strain on the Mn emission. Upon pressure processing, an unexpected blueshift of Mn emission was achieved. When the pressure reached a pressure of 2.1&#8197;GPa, the conventional redshift of Mn emission reappeared. Remarkable color transition from red to orange and then back to red was observed during pressure treatment. Further analysis revealed that the application of external pressure facilitated the diffusion of Mn atoms into the CdS shell, strengthened host&#8208;dopant coupling and mitigated the lattice mismatch rate within the MnS@CdS QDs. These factors resulted in a reduction in phonon coupling strength and an increase in energy transfer efficiency from the exciton of the CdS host lattice to the Mn dopants, thus ultimately accounting for the abnormal blueshift of Mn d&#8722;d emission. Our findings represent a significant breakthrough in the quest for precise control and regulation of Mn&#8208;related emission, offering insights into the underlying luminescence mechanism of Mn emission.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electric Field of an S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction by an Ultrasonication&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Effect for Sonocatalytic Therapy of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional antibiotic therapy, photo&#8208; and sonodynamic therapies generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for effectively combating drug resistance. This study address challenges in the low ROS generation efficiency of piezoelectric materials and sonosensitizers through molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy indicates advantages in combating antibiotics&#8208;resistant bacteria and deep tissue infections, but challenges remain in the less efficient charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of sonosensitizers. Herein, an effective bactericidal strategy is developed through enhancing the interfacial electric field (IEF) of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions by an ultrasonication&#8208;triggered piezoelectric effect. Hollow barium titanate (hBT) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through template etching, followed by in situ assembly of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with Zn2+ to obtain hBT@ZnTCPP. Both experimental and theoretical evidences support the notion that an IEF is generared from ZnTCPP to hBT. Compared to metalloporphyrins with Fe3+, Mn3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+, the stronger reduction of ZnTCPP induced by elevation of the orbital energy level of porphyrins after Zn2+ coordination leads to formation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The ultrasonication&#8208;activated polarization field enhances IEF and boosts energy band bending of hBT@ZnTCPP to promote electron&#8208;hole separations and ROS generations. Planktonic methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and their derived biofilms are completely destroyed within 5&#160;min under ultrasonication through up&#8208;regulating genes of glucose catabolism and ion transportation and down&#8208;regulating genes of ribosomal synthesis and transmembrane transporter. Thus, this study demonstrates molecular&#8208;level modulation of energy levels for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation to achieve efficient sonocatalytic therapy of bacterial infections.

         <title>Polar Three&#8208;dimensional Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Realize Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;driven Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide hybrid perovskite has been reported to drive highly sensitive self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection due to its superior semiconducting attributes and bulk photovoltaic effect. This work further promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ultraviolet photodetection and provides a new path for assembling novel optoelectronic devices without external bias voltage.







Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) triggered by spontaneous polarization in polar organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has brought unprecedented development opportunities for self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection. However, the currently reported ultraviolet optoelectronic devices are dominated by low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites, in which low carrier mobility limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time a polar three&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, namely MHyPbBr3 (1, MHy=methylhydrazine), that achieves high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven ultraviolet photodetection. Benefitting from the large spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconductor attributes, 1 exhibits 0.33&#8197;V BPVE and high carrier mobility lifetime product (&#956;&#964;) of 1.972&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm&#8722;2&#8201;V&#8722;1 under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, such merits contribute to efficient self&#8208;driven photodetection, where responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach up to 198&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 1.42&#215;1013 Jones, surpassing most reported ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, based on the reversible phase transition of 1, we have achieved controllable ultraviolet photoelectric detection. This work will shed light on the fabrication of high&#8208;response self&#8208;driven ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Extendable Synthesis of Organic Cations for In Situ Construction of Hybrid Metal Halides with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence and Strong Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extendable synthetic strategy has been developed for in situ construction of a library of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) with tailored sulfonium A&#8208;site organic cations. The template reaction with precise modular and regioselective control enables tuning of the reactants and reaction pathway, resulting in functional OIHMHs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) or strong second harmonic generation (SHG).







Abstract
The A&#8208;site organic components of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) significantly impact their crystal structure and optoelectronic properties. However, chemical modification of A&#8208;site cations has been mostly limited to commercial organic precursors, which restricts the structural variability of OIHMHs for optimal functionalities. Herein we have proposed an extendable synthesis approach to the direct procurability of various organic cations with desireable structures for the in situ construction of a library of OIHMH materials. The template condensation reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone derivatives yields A&#8208;site organic cations with exquisite control of modularization and regioselectivity within the OIHMH crystallization system. The as&#8208;fabricated OIHMHs demonstrated highly efficient linear optical photoluminescence or nonlinear optical second harmonic generation, promising potential applications in photonic devices. This in situ synthetic strategy offers a structural extension of OIHMHs and establishes a fundamental methodological platform for screening functional OIHMH materials.

         <title>Triplet Exciplex Mediated Multi&#8208;Color Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow Mate&#8208;rials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bi&#8208;component room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that display a near&#8208;infrared afterglow have been prepared. The triplet state of the host has been shown to transfer energy to the dopant via a triplet exciplex, leading to a highly persistent emission.







Abstract
Organic long&#8208;lived phosphorescent materials demonstrating ultra&#8208;long photoluminescence have practical advantages owing to their flexible design and easy processability. However, the exact photophysical process underpinning the persistent&#8208;luminescent continues to elude full understanding, and the principles governing the compatibility of hosts and guests remain elusive. In this work, a new type of nonradiative energy transfer mechanism is proposed for the bi&#8208;component RTP system. Different from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter&#8208;type energy transfer, this energy transfer mechanism primarily relies on a triplet exciplex to exchange the electron. This facilitates the formation of triplet excitons that are otherwise difficult to excite directly. An evaluation methodology is devised to gauge the potential of a specific dopant&#8208;host combination toward generating pronounced afterglow. According to this framework, the enhancement of the afterglow is proportional to the decrease in the activation energy (&#916;G&#8800;) associated with the electron transfer reaction between the dopant and the host. Notably, when the &#916;G&#8800; too larger, no observable afterglow occurs, as higher &#916;G&#8800; values significantly impede the electron transfer reaction between the two components. Furthermore, the remarkable dependence of afterglow intensity on the dopant concentration renders the bi&#8208;component RTP system highly promising for applications requiring ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and broad&#8208;spectrum detection capabilities.

         <title>Efficient Methane Purification Using a Robust and Recoverable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions have led to an ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on a tetratopic bithiophene derivative. The HOF is characterized by good chemical stability even in concentrated acid and base solutions, and dense packing density and high adsorption selectivity toward acetylene and carbon dioxide for efficient purification of methane, as well as facile material regeneration.







Abstract
Efficient separation and purification of methane is a key step in promoting its wide application as an environmentally friendly energy carrier and an important chemical raw material. Development of single solid adsorbents simultaneously combining robust structure, high separation capacity, and easy performance recovery is highly desired but quite a challenge for realizing methane depuration. In the present study, we report an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework compound constructed from a tetracyano bithiophene&#8208;functionalized ligand. Similar to the acting principle of enzymes, multisite supramolecular interactions endow the material with not only extraordinary chemical stability in wide pH range including 12&#8197;M HCl and 20&#8197;M NaOH solutions but also highly selective recognition of acetylene and carbon dioxide over methane. The packing densities and adsorption selectivities toward acetylene and carbon dioxide are the highest reported for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its highly efficient methane purification ability from binary and even ternary mixed gases, with not only methane productivities up to 2.34&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 but also moderate regeneration energy. Furthermore, the title compound can be easily regenerated in almost quantitative yield via simple rato&#8208;evaporation of its dichloromethane solution once its activity is attenuated or lost.

         <title>Step&#8208;Edge Guided Homoepitaxy Enables Highly Reversible Zn Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy mechanism to precisely regulate nucleation, growth and the reversibility of Zn anode, which enables ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. The resultant Zn(0002) epitaxy achieves unprecedented reversibility and stability over thousands of hours in Zn metal batteries. Reversible electrochemical epitaxy may bring breakthrough toward energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.







Abstract
Metal anodes are of profound impact towards the realization of energy&#8208;dense rechargeable batteries. However, the &#8220;hostless&#8221; metal redox always presents the disordered plating/stripping, aggravated by the side reactions and local anisotropy that cause the formation of excessive dendrites/voids and quickly lead to battery failure. Here we report step&#8208;edge guided homoepitaxy enabling ordered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Zn plating/stripping regardless of the (dis)charging conditions. Through engineering the atomic terrace height on the mono&#8208;oriented Zn(0002) foil anodes, both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane epitaxy aligned to the underlying Zn lattice are demonstrated via the favored edge nucleation and strong interfacial interaction driven by the surface/interface energy minimization, achieving the electrochemical homoepitaxy of continuous, submillimeter&#8208;scale Zn(0002) crystal with nearly 100&#8201;% theoretical density. Accordingly, we achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;%, high depths of discharge exceeding 51&#8201;% and 82&#8201;% along with record&#8208;high lifetimes of over a thousand and hundreds of hours, respectively, in zinc metal batteries. The breakthrough results provide new insights on the intrinsic metal plating/stripping from the view of reversible homoepitaxy for rechargeable energy&#8208;dense metal batteries.

A series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations have been constructed. The excited state and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated by changing the three&#8208;dimensional architectures.

Abstract
Achieving efficient long&#8208;wavelength organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge due to the energy gap law, which leads to increased non&#8208;radiative decay rates as the emission wavelength shifts to longer regions. Herein, a strategy of constructing folded three&#8208;dimensional architectures is proposed to explore new orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics. Innovatively, naphthalene is selected as a bridge to connect O&#8208;bridged triphenylamine donor and planar dibenzo[a,c]phenazine acceptor respectively via simple Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling. In this way, a series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations are elaborately constructed by modifying end groups, adjusting the numbers of naphthalene and donor, and regulating the linkage sites. The excited state natures and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated and optimized by changing three&#8208;dimensional architectures. Finally, the prepared emitter QX36 achieves a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate, a higher radiative rate and a higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based QX36 present the excellent electroluminescent performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.3&#8201;% and EQE of 20.6&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which are the leading values of solution&#8208;processed orange&#8208;red OLEDs. This work demonstrates the promising potential of folded TADF based naphthalene backbone as emitters for future efficient solution&#8208;processed long&#8208;wavelength OLEDs.

The click chemist's playground: The most important certainty&#8208;of&#8208;chance outcome of click chemistry was the realization that perfect reactions can exist. Chemistry is about bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking reactions between atoms and molecules. So, the emergence of &#8220;perfect reaction&#8221; status promises to be transformative to the very heart of chemistry, and thence to the range of benefits for mankind that its future evolution may hold.

         <title>Smart Targeting Layer on Silver Nanowire Electrodes Achieving Efficiency Breakthroughs in ITO&#8208;Free Conventional Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored functional targeted molecules to form self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) that precisely wrap around the surface of silver nanowire electrodes. This smart targeting layer enables simultaneous flexible work function tuning and hydrophilicity enhancement for silver nanowire electrodes, resulting in efficiency breakthroughs in conventional flexible organic solar cells with ITO&#8208;free electrodes and exceptional mechanical flexibility.







Abstract
Silver nanowire (AgNW) electrodes, known for their intrinsic flexibility and tunable optoelectronic properties, have garnered considerable attention for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, in conventional OSCs, their low work function (WF) causes energy&#8208;level mismatches with classic aqueous hole transport layers (HTLs), while their poor hydrophilicity hinders the formation of optimized HTL morphology and crystallinity, posing challenges to their integration into high&#8208;performance OSCs. To address these issues, functionally targeted molecules with a thiol group at one end and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing, hydrophilic functional groups at the other are precisely engineered to wrap around the AgNW electrodes. The thiol group facilitates the formation of robust self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) on the AgNW electrodes through stable S&#8722;Ag chemical bonds at room temperature. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups generate notable molecular and interfacial dipoles that effectively raise the WF of AgNW electrodes. Notably, the hydrophilic groups not only improve electrode wettability but also promote strong hydrogen bonding interactions with HTL, leading to substantial improvements in the morphology and crystallinity of the HTL. This precision wrapping strategy enables the fabrication of high&#8208;efficient conventional flexible OSCs, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 18.84&#8201;% (certified at 18.56&#8201;%) for flexible OSCs based on ITO&#8208;free transparent electrodes.

         <title>Leveraging Carbon Quantum Dot Spacers as Dual Proton/Electron Boosters to Upgrade TiO2@Polydopamine Photocatalysts for pH&#8208;Resilient Conversion of O2 into H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CDs act as spacers to buffer the concentration of protons of the interspatial microenvironment between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, which sustain high and stable local acidity therein and, at the same time, boost the transfer of protons and photogenerated electrons from the TiO2 cores to their PDA shells with excellent kinetic matching with each other.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, which is generally jeopardized by the kinetic mismatch between photogenerated electron transfer and proton supply. To address the challenge, here we proposed a new core&#8211;shell design of nanocomposite catalysts comprising of carbon quantum dot (CD)&#8208;topped TiO2 nanoparticles encapsulated by polydopamine (PDA) shells, which delivered stable catalytic activity across a pH range of 1&#8211;9, exhibiting a photocatalytic generation rate of H2O2 that reached 18.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in methanol and 8.66&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water. This extraordinary, pH&#8208;tolerant photocatalytic generation of H2O2 was benefited from the innovative use of CDs, interspaced between the TiO2 cores and PDA shells, not only as a reservoir of protons to buffer the local acidic microenvironment but also as a proton/electron dual booster to sustain an excellent kinetic match between the proton and photogenerated electron transfer, thus enabling the O2 reduction to selectively proceed via two&#8208;electron reaction pathway over a wide pH span.

         <title>Mass Activity Elucidation of Cobalt&#8208;Based Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Utilizing Depth&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy in the Presence of Various Cations with Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass activity of oxygen evolution reaction over cobalt oxide (CoOx) deposited on Ti substrate decreases with higher loading because of the non&#8208;uniform distribution of the active layer in the bulk direction. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis reveals that the active layer is affected by the dissolved alkali metal cations rather than chloride ions, resulting in a distinct performance.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is a kinetically sluggish reaction that requires catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity. Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is among the best performing OER catalysts and has been reported to have &#8220;bulk activity&#8221; with active sites distributed within the material. Herein, we examined the distribution of OER activity over &#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2 loaded CoOx deposited on anti&#8208;corrosive Ti substrate in 1&#8197;M KOH with and without various cations with chloride (X&#8722;Cl, X=Li, Na, K). Depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed. In a thin sample with ~20&#8197;nm thickness, uniform oxidation was observed, but a thicker sample with ~80&#8197;nm thickness had active oxidized phases close to the surface and an unexpected inactive Co0 phase concurrently occupying about three&#8208;quarters of the CoOx layer in the depth direction, which accounted for the mass activity loss. The formation of Co0 in the bulk is attributed to the galvanic replacement reaction between CoOx and the metallic Ti substrate, which is not observed on the carbon substrate. Operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the type of cations rather than Cl&#8722; impacts the OER performance likely due to their interaction with superoxo species.

         <title>H&#8208;Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) was constructed for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. The intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5 accelerate PCET in the ORR, and this facilitated the adsorption of O2 onto the C sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
Tuning proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQDs&#8208;C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo&#8208;catalytic synthesis rate of 5025&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions, surpassing that of most reported piezoelectric materials. This efficiency is attributed to the intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which significantly accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric&#8208;generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane, and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H&#8208;bond networks. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto the C2 sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway. Additionally, a piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline&#8208;rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and antibiotic&#8208;resistant genes degradation, etc. This study highlights the critical role of H&#8208;bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.

     alt="H-Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot-anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric-Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A H-bond-driven proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process based on carbon quantum dot-anchored C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (CQDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) was constructed for piezo-catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. The intermolecular H-bonds between CQDs and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; accelerate PCET in the ORR, and this facilitated the adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto the C sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H-bond-driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dot-anchored C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (CQDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) for piezo-catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. CQDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited a remarkable piezo-catalytic synthesis rate of 5025&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under ambient conditions, surpassing that of most reported piezoelectric materials. This efficiency is attributed to the intermolecular H-bonds between CQDs and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which significantly accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric-generated charges, from the dipole field of the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; plane, and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H-bond networks. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto the C2 sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway. Additionally, a piezo-self-Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline-rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes degradation, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the critical role of H-bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsically Photothermal&#8208;Driven and Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Enabled by Multifunctional Dynamic Covalent Organic Photothermal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional photothermal molecule is introduced for the fabrication of novel versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomers. The obtained materials possessed both photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and reconfigurability. Three demonstration models, a biomimetic flower, a soft gripper, and a weightlifting actuator have been created to demonstrate the reconfigurability of actuators.







Abstract
Intrinsically photothermal&#8208;responsive soft actuators possessing reconfigurability have attracted great attention due to their ability to change their actuation mode to satisfy diverse practical applications. However, challenges remain in designing and fabricating organic photothermal molecules featuring polymerizable or cross&#8208;linkable groups, especially those with multifunctional properties. Here, a novel class of versatile light&#8208;driven reconfigurable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, denoted as PUOLCE, has been developed. The multifunctional dynamic covalent organic photothermal molecules, serving as chain extenders, photothermal agents, and dynamic covalent bond precursors, are chemically bonded into LCEs, thereby endowing the LCEs with photothermal&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic properties. The intrinsic photothermal effect of PUOLCE allows the exchange reaction of dynamic oxime&#8208;carbamate bonds to undergo rapid welding under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Leveraging the NIR&#8208;assisted welding strategy, the PUOLCE&#8208;based building units are capable of assembling into various complex actuators with new deformation modes. Besides, the assembled actuators can be easily reconfigured to perform different mechanical tasks (e.g., flower blooming, grasping objects, and elevating objects) under NIR illumination. Furthermore, the PUOLCE actuators can be controlled globally or locally for light&#8208;driven locomotion by controlling the area exposed to the NIR irradiation. This work provides insights into the development of adaptive soft actuators with tunable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities.

         <title>An Authentic Al=Si Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first example of a bona fide Al=Si double bond stabilized in a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle, which exhibits an unprecedentedly short Al&#8722;Si bond length of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and a high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. We illustrate the typical double bond reactivity through the intramolecular activation of C&#8722;H bonds of the Tip group (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), as well as through intermolecular reactions with sulfur sources.







Abstract
Aluminatasilenes are the elusive heavier counterparts of the well&#8208;known borataalkenes in which the B=C double bond is formally replaced by an Al=Si moiety. We report the isolation of a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle with a bona fide Al=Si double bond, which is obtained by the reaction of 2&#8197;eq. of disilenide Tip2Si=SiTipLi with H2AlCl (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis confirm the double bond character with a very short Al&#8722;Si bond of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. Intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by the Al=Si bond and the reactions with sulfur sources confirm typical double bond reactivity.

         <title>Localized Alkaline Microenvironments Enhanced upon Tip Effects for Efficient Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>

CuO nanowires can effectively accumulate OH&#8722; in the solution through the tip&#8208;enhanced effect, creating a highly alkaline microenvironment and thereby providing conditions for electrochemical in situ disinfection.







Abstract
The electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high&#8208;voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an in situ electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8722;12&#8197;mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&#8722;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire&#8208;derived tip&#8208;enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&#8722; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 107&#8197;CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V. The resulting increase in OH&#8722; concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor, explicitly vectorizes molecular environments around protons, capturing covalent, non&#8208;covalent, and solvent effects for precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions. H&#8208;SPOC achieves the highest accuracy across SAMPL benchmarks, resolves stereoelectronic anomalies, predicts crystal&#8208;phase pKa variations, and correlates pKa with reaction rates, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, expanding its potential applications in drug design, molecular catalysis and materials science.







Abstract
Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2&#8208;acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.

&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; predictions. H-SPOC achieves the highest accuracy across SAMPL benchmarks, resolves stereoelectronic anomalies, predicts crystal-phase p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; variations, and correlates p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; with reaction rates, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, expanding its potential applications in drug design, molecular catalysis and materials science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H-SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non-covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site-specific p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values accurately. H-SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state-of-the-art methods. H-SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2-acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non-equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra-p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H-SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro- and supra-p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into Co&#8208;Catalytic Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Support Interactions for Boosting Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions between cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts and graphitic carbon nitride (Co&#8208;GCN) facilitate strong binding with lithium polysulfides through the formation of Li&#8722;N and Co&#8722;S bonds. This co&#8208;contribution of Co&#8208;GCN significantly lowers the activation energy (Ea) for the sulfur reduction reactions, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect and resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performances in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with abundant electrocatalytic centers has been identified as the most desirable strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, the co&#8208;contribution from SAC and its support via their interactions for accelerating the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) has so far received little attention, since the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculations, Cobalt&#8208;SACs supported on a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (Co&#8208;GCN), are selected to elucidate the co&#8208;catalytic role in enhancing the SRR. The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li&#8722;N bonds, as well as N/C&#8208;coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co&#8208;SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co&#8722;S bonds. Consequently, both Co&#8208;SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1584.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Detecting Organic Semiconductors Featuring a Tetraheterocyclic Core with Reduced Ionization Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron acceptor containing an asymmetric tetraheterocyclic core with a reduced ionization potential has been shown to exhibit a narrow optical band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and a remarkably low Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV. The fabricated organic photodetectors demonstrate high specific detectivities comparable to those of germanium photodetectors at wavelengths below 1.2&#8197;&#956;m.







Abstract
Infrared organic semiconductors are crucial in organic optoelectronics, yet high&#8208;performance materials with photoresponse beyond 1.1&#8197;&#956;m (the limit of crystalline silicon) remain scarce due to the limit of building blocks including strong electron&#8208;donating units. Here, we report an asymmetric tetraheterocycle (TPCT) with a reduced ionization potential of 6.18&#8197;eV relative to those reported dithiophene&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating blocks, and TPCT&#8208;2F and TPCTO&#8208;2F constructed with TPCT as the core exhibit absorption onset up to 1&#8197;&#956;m and 1.4&#8197;&#956;m, respectively. Especially, TPCTO&#8208;2F possesses a narrow band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and displays a small Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV comparable to or even lower than those of some typical inorganic short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) semiconductors (13&#8211;44&#8197;meV). The organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on TPCT&#8208;2F achieve a peak detectivity (D*) of 2.2&#215;1013 Jones at 810&#8197;nm under zero bias, among the highest values for reported OPDs and on par with commercial silicon photodetectors. Impressively, TPCTO&#8208;2F&#8208;based OPDs demonstrate a wide response from 0.3 to 1.4&#8197;&#956;m and high D* comparable to germanium photodetector at wavelengths &lt;1.2&#8197;&#956;m with a maximum D* of 2.3&#215;1011 Jones at 1.06&#8197;&#956;m in SWIR region.

         <title>Integrating Two Photochromics into One Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistically Enhancing Multiple Photocatalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating porphyrin and triphenylamine photochromics together, a photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed. The COF can synergistically enhance generation of both &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 for broad photocatalytic aerobic oxidations, demonstrating that precisely integrating multiple photochromics into one COF is a powerful strategy for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for wide photoreactions.







Abstract
While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three&#8208;dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations. Characterization studies not only show the formation of a crystalline and three&#8208;dimensional porous framework, but also reveal its effective photochemical semiconductor properties derived from the porphyrin and triphenylamine moieties. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the COF is an effective photocatalyst for the generation of both singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;). Synergistically enhanced efficiency in all photocatalytic reactions of photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of alkylbenzenes and silanes as well as thioanisoles, and cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and indole is confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, demonstrating its promising potential for broad photocatalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded ether groups significantly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons in COFs, and promote electron accumulation at the C=N imine bonds, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO2 active sites remains a key hurdle for high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction. Herein, an embedded functional group, ether group is introduced into porphyrin&#8208;triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether&#8208;embedded COFs (TOT&#8208;TAPP, BOD&#8208;TAPP and QOB&#8208;TAPP) demonstrate significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non&#8208;ether&#8208;embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO2 adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.

     alt="Ether-Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embedded ether groups significantly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons in COFs, and promote electron accumulation at the C=N imine bonds, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active sites remains a key hurdle for high-performance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, an embedded functional group, ether group is introduced into porphyrin-triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether-embedded COFs (TOT-TAPP, BOD-TAPP and QOB-TAPP) demonstrate significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non-ether-embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating Organic Electrode for Zinc Batteries via Adjusting Solvation Structure of Zn Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits the Zn2+ storage performance of organic electrodes, particularly in thick electrodes with high mass loading. Here, adding 2&#8201;% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O molecules into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly accelerating the de&#8208;solvation process and enabling the thick poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrode to exhibit high performance.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;organic batteries, combining the low cost and high capacity of Zn anodes with the tunable and sustainable properties of organic cathodes, have garnered significant attention. Herein, we present a zinc&#8208;organic battery featuring a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) cathode, a Zn anode, and an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte, which delivers a high capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life (10,000 cycles) when tested with a low PBQS loading (2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The charge storage mechanism in the PBQS cathode involves solvated Zn2+ adsorption and consequent Zn2+ coordination with PBQS companied by de&#8208;solvation process, as confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis. However, sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation leads to a loss of Zn2+ coordination capacity when tested with higher PBQS loading (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) even at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the addition of 2&#8201;% H2O to the DMF electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly facilitating the de&#8208;solvation process. As a result, the PBQS cathode (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retains its Zn2+ storage capacity when using the modified electrolyte. This approach offers a new strategy for improving the rate performance of organic electrodes, complementing existing conductivity enhancements.

The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial synthesis. A highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst is reported by Yuemin Wang, Silke Behrens et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202423273). Pd clusters/particles confined on the nanoparticulate ceria matrix feature abundant interfacial Pd2+ sites and adjacent O vacancies, accounting for the superior performance in both activity and stability.

Pd clusters/particles confined on the nanoparticulate ceria matrix feature abundant interfacial Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and adjacent O vacancies, accounting for the superior performance in both activity and stability.

In their Research Article (e202424391), Ayumi Ishii and co&#8208;workers present a giant bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in chiral polar crystals of helical 1D lead halide perovskites using chiral naphthylethylamine cations. The crystals, with a C2 space group, exhibit strong circular dichroism and an exceptional BPVE, achieving an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 15&#160;V&#8212;five times their band gap. These findings highlight the potential of chiral polar semiconductors for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic applications.

The balance between the flexibility of the bipyridine&#8208;based diamine and the coordination domain's denticity drives the self&#8208;assembly of four distinct [Ag+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag+]&#8208;stabilized architectures, as reported by Bartosz Szyszko et al. in their Communication (e202423962). Using 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine leads to the formation of molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon links, while a 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde favors [2]catenanes and trefoil knot. The Frontispiece art accentuates the unique Solomon link architecture by depicting two interlocked, snake&#8208;like motifs that guard their cherished silver eggs.

Selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry has been seamlessly integrated with CuAAC. In their Research Article (e202500942), Wei Hou, Wei Zhou, Hongtao Xu et al. report a novel three&#8208;component reaction involving benzoselenazolones, alkynes, and azides. This reaction proceeds via a unique SeNEx&#8211;CuAAC tandem pathway, providing direct access to diverse 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles regioselectively with high atom economy. It was applied to successfully identify a potent Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase inhibitor through target&#8208;based screening.

         <title>Photobiocatalytic Reaction: From Single Component to Triple Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under visible light, an enantioselective multicomponent reaction was achieved by exploiting natural enzyme diversity and biocompatible photochemistry.







Abstract
Despite remarkable advances in photoenzymatic methodologies, the development of photoenzymatic multicomponent reactions remains a significant challenge. In this Highlight, we showcase a recent breakthrough by Prof. Xiaoqiang Huang and co&#8208;workers, who achieved enantioselective triple&#8208;component radical sorting via visible light&#8208;induced biocatalysis under mild conditions. This innovative approach opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex molecules with high precision and efficiency, marking a remarkable advance in the field of enzymatic photocatalysis.

The principles concerning the geometric size and chemical coordination of 2e&#8722; ORR catalysts were outlined to highlight the evolution of material design from 2e&#8722; ORR to 4e&#8722; ORR. Recent advances in atomically dispersed metal catalysts for 4e&#8722; ORR, including M&#8722;N&#8722;C coordination, light heteroatom doping, dual&#8208;metal coordination, and interactions with nanoparticles, were then thoroughly reviewed.







Abstract
Developing eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical devices for electrosynthesis, fuel cells (FCs), and metal&#8208;air batteries (MABs) requires precisely designing the electronic pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process. Understanding the principle of developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and stable catalysts helps to reduce the usage of noble metals in ORR. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) emerge as promising alternatives to replace commercial noble metals due to their high utilization of active metal atoms, high intrinsic activity, and controllable coordination environments. In this review, the research tendency and reaction mechanisms in ORR are first summarized. The basic principles concerning the geometric size and chemical coordination of two&#8208;electron ORR (2e&#8722; ORR) catalysts were then discussed, aiming to outline the evolution of material design from 2e&#8722; ORR to four&#8208;electron ORR (4e&#8722; ORR). Subsequently, recent advances in ADMCs primarily investigated for the 4e&#8722; ORR are well&#8208;documented. These advances encompass studies on M&#8722;N&#8722;C coordination, light heteroatom doping, dual&#8208;metal atoms&#8208;based coordination, and interaction between nanoparticle (NPs)/nanoclusters (NCs) and atomically dispersed metals (ADMs). Finally, the setups for 2/4e&#8722; ORR applications, key challenges, and opportunities in the future design of ADMCs for the ORR are highlighted.

         <title>Spin State Regulation for Peroxide Activation: Fundamental Insights and Regulation Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basics of spin state theory and its key influencing factors, including crystal field, ligand environment, and valence changes. It further discusses how spin state affect peroxide activation by altering adsorption energy, energy barriers, and electron transfer, ultimately enhancing selective ROS generation for more sustainable peroxide&#8208;based oxidation applications.







Abstract
Peroxides are widely used in environmental applications due to their strong oxidizing properties, however, traditional activation methods often face challenges such as uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and high energy barriers. Recent advancements in spin state regulation provide a promising alternative to enhance the efficiency of peroxide activation. This review provides an overview of spin fundamentals and discusses the key factors affecting spin state in catalytic materials, including crystal field configuration, ligand environment, and valence changes. Subsequently, the role of electron spin state in peroxide activation is comprehensively analyzed, with a focus on how spin state regulation can tune adsorption energy, lower energy barriers, facilitate electron transfer between transition metals and peroxides, and promote selective ROS generation. Finally, this review briefly outlines the practical applications of peroxide activation in water treatment and concludes with a summary and perspectives on future research directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of spin state regulation in advancing peroxide activation strategies.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;solid Fiber&#8208;shaped Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Fire Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;solid fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) with fire resistance were developed by incorporating an in&#8197;situ polymerized flame&#8208;retardant gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Utilizing a dual mechanism of gas&#8208;phase radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation, the GPE&#8208;based FLIBs exhibit no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under a range of abusive conditions.







Abstract
Flexible batteries such as scalable fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) hold great potential for powering wearable electronics due to their excellent electrochemical performance, flexibility, and weavability. However, the use of organic liquid electrolytes raises serious safety concerns, including leakage and combustion hazards. In this study, we develop fire&#8208;resistant lithium cobalt oxide/graphite FLIBs by employing an in&#8197;situ polymerized gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) incorporating 1,3,3,5,5&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) as a flame retardant and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as a crosslinker. This in&#8197;situ polymerization of GPE is well&#8208;suited for continuous FLIB production and enhances the electrolyte/electrode interface. The resulting GPE eliminates the inherent flammability of liquid electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time, attributed to a dual flame&#8208;retardant mechanism: gas&#8208;phase free radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation. Notably, the FLIBs using the flame&#8208;retardant GPEs demonstrate no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under various abusive conditions, including mechanical abuse (cutting or collision), electrical abuse (overcharging or overdischarging), and thermal abuse (overheating or fire hazards). Additionally, these FLIBs achieve excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles, and retain 99.4&#8201;% of capacity after 10,000 bending cycles, highlighting their outstanding durability. This work presents an effective and straightforward approach to greatly enhance the safety and practicality of FLIBs for wearable applications.

         <title>The Interplay Between Component Denticity and Flexibility Promotes the Formation of [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised Links and Knots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between the diamine&#8216;s flexibility and the coordination domain&#8216;s denticity governed the self&#8208;assembly of four distinct [AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI]&#8208;stabilised architectures. Reactions with 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine produced molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link, while 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot. Selected assemblies showed interesting luminescent properties.







Abstract
A subtle interplay between the flexibility of the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;based diamine and the denticity of the coordination domain formed upon self&#8208;assembly enabled the formation of four distinct topologies stabilised by [Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag]2+ pairs. The reactions utilising 2,6&#8208;diformylpyridine resulted in the formation of silver(I)&#8208;stabilised molecular tweezer, trefoil knot, and Solomon link. The 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine&#8208;based dialdehyde promoted the formation of [2]catenanes and trefoil knot, demonstrating very close AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI distances. Two of the studied assemblies demonstrated interesting luminescent properties in the solid state.

         <title>[C2N4H7O][NH2SO3]: High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Ditrigon Coupled Guanylurea Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on unit coupling strategy, a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+), was proposed, and a novel KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like UV NLO crystal [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The Development of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High&#8208;performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe2BO3F2 template structure at the molecular level, the first metal&#8208;free guanylurea sulfamate [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase&#8208;matching capability provides the potential for a fourth&#8208;harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Based on unit coupling strategy, a high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), was proposed, and a novel KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like UV NLO crystal [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O][NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Development of high-performance short-wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High-performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; template structure at the molecular level, the first metal-free guanylurea sulfamate [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O][NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase-matching capability provides the potential for a fourth-harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction Integrating Selenium(II)&#8211;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Chemistry and Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 16, April 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4,5&#8208;Trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were synthesized regioselectively with high atom economy by seamlessly integrating selenium(II)&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry with CuAAC. This multicomponent reaction was applied to the successful identification of a potent Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase inhibitor through target&#8208;based screening. A mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide complex was synthesized and used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.








Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tools for rapidly constructing compound libraries with sufficient molecular diversity and complexity. Herein, to fully leverage a third aspect of molecular diversity enabled by the selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) reaction between alkynes and benzoselenazolones, a novel CuI&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reaction has been successfully developed. This reaction integrates SeNEx with CuAAC click chemistry, enabling rapid and regioselective synthesis of 1,4,5&#8208;trisubstituted 5&#8208;seleno&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high atom economy and good to excellent yields (65 examples, 50%&#8211;95%). Notably, this MCR demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and features modular, predictable, robust, mild reaction conditions, and operational simplicity (air and water compatibility). Extensive mechanism studies have revealed that this reaction proceeds by a unique SeNEx&#8208;CuAAC tandem reaction pathway, distinguishing it from conventional copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted click reactions. Importantly, a mononuclear &#963;&#8208;bound copper(I)&#8208;acetylide Cu1 was synthesized and confirmed to be an efficient catalyst for the SeNEx reaction. This discovery provides crucial mechanistic insights into the preferential reactivity of alkynyl groups toward SeNEx over CuAAC. Furthermore, preliminary biological activity screening identified compound 14 as a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli &#946;$\upbeta$&#8208;glucuronidase (EcGUS), with an IC50 value of 3.16 &#181;M. These findings underscore the significant potential of this MCR in synthetic chemistry, medical chemistry, and chemical biology.

         <title>Accelerated Design of Fenton&#8208;Like Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Adaptive Learning with Genetic Programming.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for optimizing catalyst synthesis are time&#8208;consuming and costly, exploring only a small fraction of the vast combinatorial space. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative but still has the limitation of relying on well&#8208;selected initial datasets, which the recent development of active learning (AL) could be addressed. Here, we novelly integrate an AL&#8208;derived algorithm, the Active Learning Genetic Algorithm (ALGA), into experimental workflows to optimize the synthesis of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Our results show that the closed&#8208;loop ALGA framework effectively learns from limited and sparse datasets, greatly reducing the research cycle compared to traditional ML and AL frameworks. By iteratively retaining better&#8208;performing genetic information and proactively expanding the search space through mutation and crossover, ALGA identifies the highest&#8208;performing Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs with less than 90 experiments. The maximum phenol degradation rate k&#8208;value (0.147 min&#8208;1) achieved within the ALGA framework is approximately 3 times higher than that of the initial dataset and surpasses the reported best Fenton&#8208;like Cu SACs. Our successful implementation of ALGA signifies an advancement in SACs synthesis assisted by the AL&#8208;derived algorithm, offering a guiding methodology for the exploration of other functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Defluoroamination of Aryl Fluorides: Harnessing the Catalytic Potential of a Unique Zinc Amide Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation and functionalization of C&#8208;F bonds, the strongest bonds between carbon and any other element, via C&#8208;N bond formation to generate complex molecules has remained a compelling challenge. Herein, we present a ligand&#8208;centered redox&#8208;controlled effective strategy employing a zinc amide catalyst (C) to achieve facile defluoroamination of fluoroarenes with several N&#8208; nucleophiles (&gt;90 substrates) under mild conditions. Notably, this adaptable protocol works readily with most types of fluoroarenes and a diverse range of N&#8208;H moieties that include secondary and primary amines, indoles, azoles, and amides under the same reaction conditions, and encouragingly, offers excellent functional group compatibility. Intriguingly, we also demonstrated its application in one&#8208;pot synthesis of (un)symmetrical triaryl amines from primary amine itself and the selective activation of C&#8208;F bonds to access F&#8208;containing amines, relevant to drug synthesis. Finally, detailed mechanistic probes via active&#8208;intermediate&#8208;capture, EPR analysis, and various control experiments, indicate that the reaction proceeds through a radical&#8208;mediated C&#8208;N coupling pathway. Importantly, use of Zn(II) center as a template to hold two amide moieties together in C enables facile intramolecular electron transfer to generate the radical intermediates for the present protocol. Finally, the practical utility of this methodology was showcased by synthesizing various drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Enhanced Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging through Intramolecular Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule imaging demands fluorophores with exceptional photostability and photon budget. This study presents an intramolecular energy transfer (IMET) strategy to enhance these critical properties. We developed xanthene&#8208;based IMET cassettes by covalently linking donor and acceptor, achieving significant improvements in single&#8208;molecule imaging performance. While extensive spectral overlap is generally beneficial in bulk systems, single&#8208;molecule imaging necessitates careful optimization to minimize direct acceptor excitation at the high excitation powers typically used. Our optimized cassettes, featuring rhodamine as donor and Si&#8208;rhodamine as acceptor, exhibit 94.8% energy transfer efficiency. This configuration effectively minimizes direct excitation&#8208;induced acceptor bleaching, as 95% of molecules exhibit donor photobleaching prior to acceptor photobleaching. This efficient energy management leads to a 670% enhancement in photostability, arising from the competition between IMET and photobleaching pathways, which effectively channels excitation energy away from photo&#8208;destructive processes. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that IMET occurs on a picosecond timescale, significantly faster than both fluorescence relaxation (nanoseconds) and photobleaching (seconds). Notably, these IMET cassettes demonstrated superior performance in single&#8208;molecule tracking applications, including on supported lipid bilayers and in live&#8208;cell tracking of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dynamics, highlighting the broad potential of the IMET strategy for advancing single&#8208;molecule imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>To Make a Painstaking Investigation: Revealing the Electrochemical Reactions in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2&#8208;based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2-based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double-discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO2 dissolution dominated by the surplus H+ in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)2 generation. This work provides a better understanding of the dissolution/deposition mechanism of Zn||MnO2 and paves the way for the practical application of manganese-based aqueous batteries. It also provides a comprehensive method to study the mechanism of electrochemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;photosensitizing Cobalt Complexes for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupled with CH3OH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal complexes as homogeneous molecular catalysts has attracted considerable attention regarding photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Enhancing these complexes with photosensitivity and photooxidation capabilities, aiming to create multi&#8208;functional molecular devices, presents significant challenges. In response to these challenges, we successfully designed and synthesized three innovative metal complexes. The complexes demonstrate a remarkable ability to perform CO2 photoreduction in tandem with methanol photooxidation, allowing for the simultaneous production of formic acid without requiring additional photosensitizers and electron sacrificial reductants. An optimal turnover number (TON) value of 855 was obtained under simulated sunlight. Even under natural sunlight, the TON can reach 207, much higher than the value of the physical mixture of the photocatalytic reductive and oxidative moieties. Spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that integrating reduction and oxidation sites in one molecular catalyst can promote charge transfer kinetics and enhance activity for CO2 reduction and methanol oxidation. This is the first report that non&#8208;noble metal homogeneous catalysts can simultaneously possess photosensitivity, photoreduction and photooxidation functions, offering new insights into designing homogeneous catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured Composite Solid Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Rate All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) have emerged as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, they still face challenges related to ionic transport across multi&#8208;scale interfaces, which leads to suboptimal battery performances. In this study, we propose a core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte with Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolyte (SE) as the core and Na2.25Y0.25Zr0.75Cl6 halide SE as the shell. This design strategy boosts high SE&#8217;s oxidative stability (4.0 V), ionic conductivity (0.44 mS cm&#8208;1) and mechanical strength (Young&#8217;s modulus of 9.19 GPa). These properties enable the composite SE to effectively mitigate the chemo&#8208;mechanically&#8208;induced multi&#8208;interfacial contact losses at the cathode side. Additionally, the homogeneous full&#8208;cell configuration, utilizing the core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte as both catholyte and SE layer, demonstrates superior rate capability, achieving a discharge capacity of 76.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 2.0 C, significantly outperforming the conventional sandwich&#8208;like designs. This work not only provides a novel design strategy for functional SE, but also offers valuable insights into the chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanism at multiscale interfaces of ASSSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Cation Exchange Enables Air&#8208;Processed Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Over 25% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scalable fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) in humid air with an antisolvent&#8208;free process is essential for future industrial applications. However, high humidity poses significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films, making it difficult to attain efficient IPSCs under ambient conditions. Here, we present an in situ cation exchange strategy to create a compact and uniform PbI2 shell on the perovskite surface by using ZnI2 in acetonitrile, where Zn2+ replaces Pb2+. This transformation is attributed to the surface defects of the perovskite, which undergo a cation exchange reaction in humid air, forming a compact PbI2 shell. The n&#8208;type PbI2 shell effectively encapsulates the perovskite films, minimizing air exposure while optimizing energy level alignment, thereby enhancing electron transport and extraction. As a result, we demonstrate IPSCs with efficiencies of 25.2% under ambient conditions (25&#8211;30&#176;C, 60 &#177; 10% RH), on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices fabricated in inert atmospheres. The devices demonstrated remarkable stability, enduring aging tests under the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I for over 4770 and 2000 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries are regarded as potential candidates for off&#8208;grid energy storage devices due to their environmental independence and simple construction. Although tremendous research efforts have been recently made to design chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries, a comprehensive review about them is still absent. This review describes the design principles of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries and their self&#8208;charging mechanism. The advances in their cathode materials mainly include transition&#8208;metal oxides or sulfides, Prussian blue analogues and organic compounds. Subsequently, the strategies of enhancing chemically self&#8208;charging kinetics are highlighted, including design of materials, selection of oxidants and introduction of catalysts. In addition, various applications of chemically self&#8208;charging batteries are also discussed in wearable electronic devices, low temperature and all&#8208;pH scenarios. In the final section, the challenges and future perspectives are presented for designing high&#8208;performance chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. It will shed light on the R&amp;D of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resource&#8208;friendly photo&#8208;rechargeable sodium batteries (PRSBs) integrate energy storage devices with solar cells offering a promising path for sustainable energy.&#160;Herein, a novel TiO2/CdSe/Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7&#160;(NFPP) cathode was prepared&#160;layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer utilizing resource&#8208;abundant&#160;commercialized&#160;NFPP and photoactive CdSe.&#160;The aligned energy levels with type II band structure&#160;ensures effective&#160;transfer of photo&#8208;generated holes from CdSe (&#8208;5.71 eV) to higher valence band of NFPP (&#8208;5.10 eV).&#160;Experimental results reveal that,&#160;during charging,&#160;the induced&#160;holes in NFPP accelerate the transition of Fe2+&#160;to Fe3+&#160;with a change of O&#8208;Fe hybrid orbitals. The calculations of bond valence sum and energy distribution reveal that NFPP&#8208;holes possesses broad Na+&#160;transport path with reduced transport barrier (from 0.512 to 0.428 eV), improving&#160;Na+&#160;extraction&#160;efficiency.

         <dc:description>The development of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) &#8208; thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is defective in relatively low reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates (commonly &lt; 5&#215;105 s&#8208;1). Herein, we fuse two 3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IAc) donor units to obtain large planar donors (m&#8208;bIAc and p&#8208;bIAc) for forming spatially folded A&#8208;D|D&#8208;A configured TSCT emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2). The configuration of highly parallel and large&#8208;plane intramolecular multiple &#960;&#8208;stacking has been achieved. The symmetrical multi&#8208;channel charge transfer networks of emitters induce multiple energetically proximal excited states within a small energy range (&lt; 0.12 eV) at the lowest excited state, creating additional configuration interaction and spin&#8208;orbit coupling channels to accelerate the RISC process. This molecular configuration yields enhanced RISC rates of 6.19&#215;105 s&#8208;1 for DCT&#8208;1 and 1.05&#215;106 s&#8208;1 for DCT&#8208;2. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 18.9% (DCT&#8208;1, 474 nm sky&#8208;blue emission) and 23.9% (DCT&#8208;2, 498 nm green emission), with attenuated efficiency roll&#8208;offs of DCT&#8208;2 (12% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2). This work provides a critical pathway for manipulating dense excited states to address the bottleneck of the RISC rates while maintaining structural rigidity, promoting further advancement of TSCT&#8208;TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) towards cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a "Cl&#8208;mediation" strategy is proposed on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure towards achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial&#8208;Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8211;CNTs (0.88 V vs. RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, which operates stably for over 150 h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial&#8208;Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C configuration.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters for Selective Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of greenhouse gas CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising way to mitigate climate change and realize carbon cycling. Atomically precise thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters have shown great potential for selective electrochemical conversion of CO2 towards CO due to their quantum confinement effect and unique electronic structures. Additionally, the atomic precision of gold nanocluster is advantageous for investigating the CO2 reduction mechanism, which is typically challenging to understand due to the complexity of the catalytic interface, and unknown structure of the active site in more conventional catalysts. By summarizing CO2 reduction catalyzed by gold nanoclusters, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to the activity, selectivity and stability of nanocluster catalysts, as well as elucidate the CO2 reduction pathway, thereby contributing to the design of more active and selective nanocluster catalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Massive Production of Dimerized Imine in Aqueous Phase via an Atomically Engineered Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic selective oxidation of organics&#160;represents a promising avenue for the sustainable production of value&#8208;added chemicals, but suffers from sluggish charge separation and difficult selectivity manipulation. In particular, the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced adsorption of expected organic products at reduction sites tends to trigger the hydrogenation side reaction, which is more pronounced in the ideal aqueous environment due to distinct polarity. Here, we report a precise cocatalyst strategy on ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photocatalyst at the atomic level to eliminate the Schottky barrier between ZIS and cocatalyst, thus achieving exceptional activity (565 &#956;mol h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99%) for photocatalytic dimerized imine production in aqueous media, which is five times more effective than ZIS loaded with Pt nanoparticles. The excellent performance is achieved by effectively attenuating the accumulation of photogenerated holes near the Pt sites and then suppressing the unwanted hydrogenation side reaction. We further demonstrate that our system can be directly scaled up to 0.5 m2 for scalable outdoor experiment and achieve solar&#8208;driven production of benzylimine with 125 mL yield and 97 wt% purity for two weeks under solar irradiation. This study presents an interfacial atomical design strategy for photocatalysts to efficiently produce high&#8208;value imine coupled with H2 under mild and green conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Total Syntheses of Cycloaurenones and Dysiherbols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloaurenones and dysiherbols are naturally occurring sesquiterpene quinones/quinols that share a 6/6/5/6 tetracyclic carbon skeleton with either a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;decalin system containing four contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Total syntheses of cycloaurenones have not been reported. Herein, we present the first enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols based on manipulation of a common cyclohexadienone intermediate: namely, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization for cycloaurenones and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition for dysiherbols. Moreover, the key cyclohexadienone intermediate was readily accessible by a bidirectional approach from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide. The 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters were installed by an unprecedented enantioselective hydrogenation of the corresponding bis&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Weinreb amide (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Vacancies with Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites for Stable and Efficient Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains challenging. Here, we present a single&#8208;atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO2 conversion. Specifically, an In2O3&#8208;based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO2 reduction performance in photothermal reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu&#8208;In2O3 catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17 mol&#183;gCu&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 hours under 3 W&#183;cm&#8208;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H2 dissociation and CO2 activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic&#8208;site engineering for efficient CO2 conversion and sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Field via Balancing Interfacial Atom Orbit Hybridization at Boride@Sulfide Heterostructure for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has facilitated the realization of hydrogen economy toward water electrolysis in alkaline media. However, the difficult water dissociation process for the Volmer step (H2O &#8594; H* + OH*) and the subsequent unsuitable OH* adsorption energy on nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts severely reduced the kinetics of HER. Herein, the universal synthesis for a series of transition metal (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W)&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts was realized by using molten&#8208;salt method to conduct the in situ boronization of commercial sulfides. Significantly, WB2@WS2 heterostructured catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for HER. Balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization between W(d)&#8208;B(s,p) and W(d)&#8208;S(s,p) at WB2@WS2 heterostructured interface enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the built&#8208;in electric field in WB2@WS2 optimizes the adsorption and desorption of OH* intermediate, favoring the enhancement of catalytic performance toward HER. Besides, the rate&#8208;determining step over WS2, which is generally considered to be the Volmer step, was changed to the step of OH* desorption over WB2@WS2, and thus the corresponding energy barrier was decreased.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkynes Enabled by a Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its discovery in 1954, the hydrocyanation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds has emerged as a powerful strategy for the synthesis of nitriles. However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base&#8208;catalyzed reversible alkyne&#8208;allene isomerization and phosphine&#8208;catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM&#8208;free, dual&#8208;catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate. The methodology secures a cost&#8208;effective access to a broad range of vinyl nitriles (40 examples) with yields up to 97% and Z/E stereoselectivity up to 20:1, including complex natural product derivatives. A comparison with TM&#8208;based systems highlighted a 2500&#8208;fold cost reduction, as well as the elimination of the troublesome separation of the regioisomers. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway, shedding light on the achieved regioselectivity. By altering one catalyst in a dual&#8208;catalytic system, we demonstrated the regioselectivity switch, thereby facilitating regiodivergent hydrocyanation (8 examples). In a broader context, this approach offers a foundation for developing the next generation of TM&#8208;free strategies for the regioselective hydrofunctionalizations of unbiased alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Deep Eutectic Solvent Achieves Ultra&#8208;Low Polarization Zinc Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) is proposed as an electrolyte for rechargeable zinc metal batteries, reducing the polarization of deep eutectic solvents to a level comparable to that of aqueous electrolytes. HEDES inhibits side reactions and dendrite growth, and its aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure facilitates rapid interfacial ion transport, enabling long&#8208;term stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of green solvents, have emerged as promising candidates for electrolytes due to their exceptional electrochemical stability. However, the DES always exhibits unacceptable polarization of cells due to its high viscosity and low ionic conductivity, which limit its practical application in batteries. In this work, the cell polarization of DES is effectively reduced to a level comparable to that of pure aqueous electrolytes by increasing the entropy of DES via the disorder&#8208;making strategy of solvation structure. Theoretically, constructing the high&#8208;entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) promotes the formation of more aggregates with high disorder, which accelerates mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the proposed HEDES (configuration entropy 17 times higher than traditional electrolyte) can achieve durable zinc plating/stripping behavior for more than 2000&#160;h with low polarization and still maintain good stability even in extreme environments. The cylindrical zinc&#8208;ion capacitor under gram&#8208;level loading can achieve a high discharge current up to 3 A, providing ideas for the design of electrolytes for zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Sodium Cyclohexanolate/Phenoxide Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair demonstrated 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. The synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light enhances the overall performance, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light provides heat, while high&#8208;frequency light facilitates the desorption of product from the catalyst surface.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage is a key challenge for the implementation of hydrogen energy, with dehydrogenation being particularly difficult because of its endothermic nature, slow kinetics, poor selectivity, etc. Solar energy&#8208;driven hydrogen uptake/release represents an interdisciplinary approach that provides an effective solution to those problems. Herein, we report the solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen uptake of 4.9&#160;wt.% over sodium cyclohexanolate/phenoxide pair, achieving over 99.9% conversion and selectivity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation via photocatalysis without external heating. Notably, the initial dehydrogenation rate reaches 23.4 mmolH2gcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{{\mathrm{l}}}_{{{{\mathrm{H}}}_2}}}{{{\mathrm{g}}}_{{\mathrm{cat}}}}^{ - 1}{{{\mathrm{h}}}^{ - 1}}$ that is ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The superior photocatalytic performance stems from the synergy between high&#8208; and low&#8208;frequency light, i.e., low&#8208;frequency light mainly provides heat, high&#8208;frequency light drives the desorption of product from the catalyst surface. This approach offers a path toward a sustainable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen energy system.

         <title>Ionized Water Facilitates the Sustainable Radical&#8208;Mediated Reduction of CO2 to Multi&#8208;Carbon Hydrocarbons and Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water generates radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) that reduce CO2 to C1&#9472;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates. e&#8315;aq activates CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables hydrogenation. Oxidative radicals recycle oxygenates back into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a sustainable network. This process demonstrates ionized water as a reactive matrix for abiotic organic synthesis. 








Abstract
The abiotic synthesis of organic compounds from CO2 and water under prebiotic conditions is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in understanding the origins of life. Here we demonstrate a radical&#8208;mediated pathway for reducing CO2 to C1&#8210;C6 hydrocarbons and oxygenates driven solely by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of water, mimicking early Earth environments. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 17O/13C isotope labeling, and femtosecond transient absorption, we identify ionized water&#8208;derived radicals (H2O&#8226;+, &#8226;OH, e&#8315;aq, &#8226;H) as the key redox mediators. e&#8315;aq acts as a super&#8208;reductant (&#8722;2.9&#160;V) to activate CO2 into CO2&#8226;&#8315;, while &#8226;H enables sequential hydrogenation. Critically, oxidative radicals (H2O&#8226;+ and &#8226;OH) recycle recalcitrant oxygenates (formate and oxalate) back into active CO2&#8226;&#8315;, sustaining a dynamic radical network. This process generates a diverse library of organic compounds, including methane, ethylene, and C6 dimethyl succinate, via radical assembly mechanisms spanning hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT), self&#8208;coupling, and cross&#8208;coupling. By integrating experimental validation with prebiotic simulations (formate&#8208;mediated redox modulation), we resolve the paradox of inert CO2/H2 activation in primordial environments and establish water not merely as a solvent but as a reactive matrix directing abiotic organic synthesis.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Gold Nanoparticles with Tunable Surface Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles, as a class of functional nanomaterials, have attracted considerable interest for biomedical applications owing to their unique chemical and physical properties. However, colloidal solutions of gold nanoparticles are thermodynamically unstable because of their high surface energy, resulting in poor stability and biocompatibility in physiological environments. Herein, we present a novel strategy for coating gold nanoparticles using in situ polymerization to form a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network polymer shell around each particle. This approach enables the creation of ultra&#8208;stable core&#8208;shell structure that effectively improves biocompatibility and stability, even in complex biological environments. The surface characteristics of the polymer shell can also be precisely tailored by carefully selecting the monomers to meet biomedical application requirements. These properties enable prolonged circulation within the bloodstream and enhanced tumor targeting in mice. This strategy offers an ultra&#8208;stable, aqueous&#8208;based, and biocompatible polymer shell for gold nanoparticles, paving the way for the surface modification of gold nanomaterials in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiospecific Halogenation Modulates Molecular Dipoles in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, through regiospecific bromination on a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole, we study the properties related to intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in the molecular dipole of the derived SAM molecules. Bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with the dense assembly promoted by enhanced intermolecular interactions and synergistic effects of stronger crystallinity, JJ26 efficiently modulates the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhances the stability of SAM under external pressure. The OSC device adopting JJ26 demonstrates significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. 








Abstract
Halogenated carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;extraction materials in conventional organic solar cells (OSCs). While halogenation helps optimize the molecular dipole, intermolecular interactions, and energetics of SAM, the highly polarizable carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be reactive and prone to photocleavage depending on their regiochemistry. Herein, we study the regiospecific properties, including the intrinsic stability, electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution, and changes in molecular dipole of the brominated SAM molecules by brominating a helical 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;based SAM (CbzNaph) featuring a stronger dipole. Additionally, a correlation between the intrinsic molecular stability and the derived SAM surface stability is established to determine the performance and stability of the OSCs. Notably, the bromination at the chemically inert sites of 7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (JJ26) helps maximize molecular dipole while maintaining superior intrinsic stability. Together with dense assembly promoted by the synergistically enhanced intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, JJ26 can efficiently modulate the work function (WF) of indium tin oxide (ITO) and enhance the stability of SAM under external stress. Consequently, the JJ26 derived OSC shows significantly improved performance, achieving an efficiency of 19.35% along with notably enhanced stability. This work shows that the precise modulation of the regiochemistry of SAM molecules is critical for improving their quality and derived device performance.

         <title>One&#8208;Component Ionizable Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers for Targeted mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of one&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), with particular focus on their organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers including core&#8208;shell and dendron&#8208;tail dendrimers for RNA delivery have also been reviewed, demonstrating the versatility of dendrimer&#8208;type delivery carriers for RNA&#8208;related therapeutics.








Abstract
mRNA nanomedicine represents a new generation of therapeutics. However, how to deliver mRNA to the desired organs and cells effectively remains challenging. Common mRNA delivery vectors include viral and nonviral types such as four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, lipid&#8208;polymer hybrid nanoparticles, and so on. One&#8208;component ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (IAJDs), are an emerging type of mRNA delivery vehicle displaying good stability and high delivery efficiency. In this review, we comprehensively present the design, synthesis, and mRNA delivery properties of IAJDs, with particular focus on the relationship between their molecular structures and organ targeted delivery properties. Other representative types of dendrimers for RNA delivery are also reviewed. Overall, this review summarizes the recent research progress on IAJDs systematically, aiming to guide the development of more efficient mRNA delivery platforms and next&#8208;generation mRNA nanomedicines.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces the torsional angle of anthraquinone compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;). This adjustment in torsional connectivity facilitates J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization in point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, presenting a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance CPL materials through the simultaneous optimization of emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency. 








Abstract
Circularly
polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8211;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here, we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the nonacetylene control compound (1.81&#176; versus 33.4&#176;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.

         <title>Boron Doping&#8208;Induced Ultrahigh Ce3+ Ratio in Amorphous CeO2/GO Catalyst for Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel strategy to synthesize amorphous CeO2/GO with an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio of 85.7% through B&#8208;doping. The resulting amorphous structure reduces the band gap, enhances charge separation efficiency, and significantly boosts diluted CO2 photocatalytic activity. The material achieves remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rates of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2) with 100% selectivity, highlighting its potential for sustainable CO2 conversion. 








Abstract
Direct utilization of diluted CO2 enables sustainable CO2 conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO2 emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO2 is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4f, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce3+. In this study, we propose a symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce3+ ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in amorphous CeO2. First&#8208;principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high&#8208;symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO2, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce3+ ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B&#8208;doped CeO2/GO shows a remarkable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 15% CO2) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1(under 1% CO2), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO2/GO with high Ce3+ an effective material for CO2 photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO2 capture and utilization.

The material achieves remarkable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion rates of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 15% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 1% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with 100% selectivity, highlighting its potential for sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct utilization of diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into valuable products, with reduced CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emerging as an attractive candidate due to its exceptional redox flexibility. The catalytic efficacy of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is intimately tied to the electronic structure of 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, yet the persistent challenge lies in maintaining a high and stable concentration of Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, we propose a symmetry-breaking-induced amorphization strategy to achieve an exceptionally high Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio by B doping, which facilitates the reduction of Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in amorphous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. First-principles calculations and infrared spectroscopy reveal that B doping with three excess electrons induces the formation of planar triangular B&#8211;O&#8323; units by disrupting the original high-symmetry Fm3&#175;m$Fm\bar 3m$ structure of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating the spontaneous transition to the amorphous phase. Electronic structure analysis confirms that even a modest 7.5% B doping can significantly elevate the Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ratio to 85.7%. The resulting amorphous B-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GO shows a remarkable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion rate of 249.33&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 15% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 103.4&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;(under 1% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with 100% selectivity in both cases. This performance highlights how amorphization stabilizes defect states, making amorphous CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GO with high Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; an effective material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and addressing key challenges in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Tandem Reaction System for High&#8208;Concentration Acetic Acid Production from Methane and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a plasma&#8208;thermo&#8208;catalytic tandem system, optimizing plasma processes in a self&#8208;designed reactor to achieve 68.0% methane conversion and 5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 methanol concentration. A hydrophobic ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S catalyst minimized byproduct effects, enabling 52.0% acetic acid selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentration, three orders of magnitude higher than traditional methods, meeting industrial criteria and advancing efficient methane utilization. 








Abstract
Directly converting methane into high&#8208;value products like CH3COOH poses significant challenges owing to the kinetic limitations of C&#9472;H activation and C&#9472;C coupling in traditional single&#8208;catalysis methods. This work systematically studied the compatibility and effectiveness of plasma and thermocatalytic tandem systems. By optimizing the plasma process in a self&#8208;designed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, we enhanced methane conversion (68.0%), methanol concentration (5.2&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1), and CO selectivity (56.9%), while preventing carbon deposition and CO2 formation. In subsequent thermocatalysis, we developed the stearic acid&#8208;modified ReRh/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;S hydrophobic catalyst to avoid the separation of methanol and CO from the mixture and minimize the influence of by&#8208;products (e.g., H2O). This innovative approach achieved 52.0% CH3COOH selectivity and 1.3&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 concentrations, three orders of magnitude than traditional methods, meeting the preliminary industrial criteria. This study demonstrates the potential of tandem catalysis, offering valuable insights for the efficient utilization of methane and other challenging catalytic reactions.

         <title>Sprayed Microdroplets Architect a Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micron&#8208;sized droplets promote rapid nucleation of metal&#8208;oxo clusters, forming polyoxometalates within sub&#8208;millisecond timescales, an outcome unattainable in the bulk phase under similar conditions, while avoiding the traditional use of corrosive chemicals, acids, and heat.








Abstract
Although many past attempts have utilized micron&#8208;sized droplets for breaking and forming organic bonds, their potential in promoting inorganic bond formation reactions remains largely unexplored. We report a promising approach to synthesizing a tungsten&#8208;based Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) in various organic and aqueous microdroplets under ambient conditions, eliminating the traditional need for hazardous or corrosive chemicals and high&#8208;boiling solvents. When aerosolized, a simple tungstate (WO42&#8722;) solution spontaneously produces a metal&#8208;oxo cluster (W6O192&#8722;), a valuable POM with broad applications, achieving yields up to 99% in less than a millisecond. Mass spectrometric detection of reactive intermediates unraveled the nucleation mechanism in microdroplets, leading to the formation of polyoxotungstate, which was then further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Empirical observations collectively suggest that rapid solvent evaporation and subsequent enrichment of reactants in the confined volume of microdroplets likely facilitate the growth of the POM through partial solvation at the air&#8211;liquid interface.

         <title>Predator&#8211;Prey Behavior of Droplets Propelling Through Self&#8208;Generated Channels in Crystalline Surfactant Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline layer is formed by an amphiphilic decylamine surfactant at the air/water interface. Aldehyde&#8208;containing ester oil droplets self&#8208;propel by consuming amines from the crystalline layer, thereby generating open channels along which myelin&#8208;forming amphiphile droplets chase and ultimately catch the aldehyde droplets in a predator&#8211;prey analogy.








Abstract
Motile droplets provide an attractive platform for liquid matter&#8208;based applications and protocell analogues displaying life&#8208;like features. The functionality of collectively operating droplets increases by the advance of well&#8208;designed (physico)chemical systems directing droplet&#8211;droplet interactions. Here, we report a strategy based on crystalline surfactant layers at air/water interfaces, which sustain the propulsion of floating droplets and at the same time shape the paths for other droplets attracted by them. First, we show how decylamine forms a closed, crystalline layer that remains at the air/water interface. Second, we demonstrate how aldehyde&#8208;based oil droplets react to decylamine in the crystalline layer by forming an imine, causing the droplets to move through the layer while leaving behind an open channel (comparable to &#8220;Pac&#8208;Man&#8221;). Third, we introduce tri(ethylene glycol) monododecylether (C12E3) droplets in the crystalline layer. The crystalline layer suppresses the motion of the C12E3 droplets, however, the aldehyde droplets create surface tension gradients upon depletion of surfactants from the air/water interface, thereby driving Marangoni flows that attract the C12E3 droplets as well as the myelin filaments they grow: Causing the C12E3 droplets to chase, and ultimately catch, the aldehyde droplets along the channels they have created, featuring a predator&#8208;prey analogy established at an air/water interface.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Assisted Electron and Proton Transfer Boosting Redox Metabolism&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis and Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium and aurintricarboxylic coordination nanoparticles generate singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals specifically triggered by acidic H2O2 via dual&#8208;Russell reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction while depleting glutathione. Significantly, adenosine triphosphate induces VAP NPs aggregation, strengthens hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and accelerates proton/electron transfer, thereby amplifying ROS level to co&#8208;activate ferroptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Compared to the intractability of traditional apoptosis, the vulnerability exposed by cancer cell metabolic reprogramming provides an advantage for ferroptosis treatment. Herein, we developed vanadate and aurintricarboxylic acid coordination nanoparticles (VAP NPs) that synergistically trigger dual cell death pathways. This nanoplatform leveraged dual&#8208;Russell mechanisms and Fenton reactions to generate singlet oxygen/hydroxyl radicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) while depleting glutathione via vanadium redox cycling, thereby silencing glutathione peroxidase 4 and modulating the Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) axis. Notably, TME&#8208;overexpressed adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acted as a biochemical catalyst, accelerating the transfer of protons and electrons during reactive oxygen species generation to amplify therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, VAP NPs could achieve outstanding efficacy for intrinsically stimulated synergy of ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor therapy. This study provides reference for revealing the new function of ATP in enhancing the regulation of redox metabolism.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Reforming Fuel Cell for Sustainable H2 Generation with ~200% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO), a promising yet enigmatic hydrogen carrier, presents both an intriguing opportunity and a formidable challenge to unlock its full potential of conversion and hydrogen (H2) generation while safeguarding environmental sustainability. This study rises to the challenge by pioneering a hybrid acid/alkali formaldehyde hydrogen production fuel cell (h&#8208;AAFHFC), an integrated system that integrates anodic partial electro&#8208;reforming of aldehydes at low potential with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The device introduces a new self&#8208;powered paradigm for H2 generation, featuring high Faradaic efficiency (FE), co&#8208;generation of electricity and acetate, and seamless synergy with renewable energy sources, all while achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions. The h&#8208;AAFHFC attains an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.11 V and a peak power density of 94 mW cm&#8208;2, enabling simultaneous H2 production at both electrodes with an extraordinary FE of approximately 200%. This breakthrough marks a transformative shift, moving from traditional electricity&#8208;driven systems to self&#8208;sustaining H2 generation. Our work lays the foundation for an eco&#8208;friendly, sustainable approach to H2 production, advancing the transition toward a carbon&#8208;neutral energy future.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels Based on Hydration Shielding&#8208;Accelerated Redox Self&#8208;Catalytic Polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional synthesis methods for polyzwitterionic hydrogels involve harsh conditions, such as thermal or UV irradiation, prolonged durations, and high monomer concentrations. Herein, we address these challenges at the meantime by proposing a novel chemical method, called hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP), facilitating the preparation of polyzwitterionic hydrogels. The discovery is that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chains can generate hydration shielding around hydrated zwitterionic monomers, promoting their effective aggregation and rapid crosslinking polymerization under the assistance of silver ions (Ag+)&#8208;potassium persulfate (S2O82&#8208;) redox catalyst. The HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method performs under mild condition (&#8208;5&#8451; to 37&#8451;) without extra energy, overcomes the critical monomer polymerization concentration limitation (wt%: 0.3%), and completes within an ultra&#8208;short polymerization time (&lt;60 s). The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good anti&#8208;swelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti&#8208;fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Competitive Adsorption Sites Tailoring Unlocks Efficient Hybrid Conversion Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

Entropy&#8208;driven competitive adsorption modulation in perovskite electrocatalysts enables hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries that couple sustainable energy storage and green chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Hybrid conversion Zn&#8211;air batteries (HC&#8208;ZABs) epitomize a typical integrated energy storage and conversion device that advances green chemistry and reduces carbon emissions. However, balancing efficiency and selectivity of electrocatalytic cathodic reactions remains the bottleneck in such batteries. Herein, we address this issue by designing a high&#8208;entropy perovskite, La0.6Sr0.1Ca0.1Rb0.1Y0.1CoO3 (HE&#8208;LCO), which outperforms conventional perovskites in offering enhanced electrocatalytic activity, better selectivity, and outstanding stability for cathodic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction (BAOR). Combined spectroscopy characterizations, operando measurements, and theoretic calculations reveal that the entropy&#8208;driven modulation of the second coordination sphere in HE&#8208;LCO balances the adsorption of nucleophile benzyl alcohol and OH&#8722;, while inhibiting competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on this rationalized HE&#8208;LCO electrocatalyst, HC&#8208;ZABs realized efficient energy storage and benzoic acid production, boasting a long lifespan of 900 cycles at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 per cycle. Further, practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale HC&#8208;ZABs demonstrated a 62.8% energy efficiency improvement and an average benzoic acid yield of 0.85&#160;g per cycle, highlighting the potential of this integrated device for simultaneous sustainable energy storage and green electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Switchable Closed&#8208;Shell and Open&#8208;Shell Biradical States in Bis&#8208;Palladium Complexes of Tetrathiadodecaphyrin via Coordination Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes of a figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin, featuring different coordination modes (NNCS&#9472;Pd versus NNCC&#9472;Pd) and electronic states (closed&#8208;shell versus open&#8208;shell biradical), have been prepared. The two complexes exhibit noteworthy photoacoustic (PA) response to the first and second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I/II) range, respectively, and are interconvertible through a one&#8208;electron redox involving a reversible metal coordination rearrangement.








Abstract
A figure&#8208;eight tetrathiadodecaphyrin (1), featuring two porphyrin&#8208;like sub&#8208;pockets separated by central carbazolylenes was synthesized. Metalation of the thiaporphyrinoid ligand with Pd(OAc)2 produces two distinct bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes with different coordination environments. Complex 2, adopting an {NNCS} metalation mode, exhibits a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure, whereas complex 3, with an {NNCC} coordination environment, exists as a ligand&#8208;centered organic biradicaloid with two magnetically independent spins (S&#160;=&#160;1/2). Biradical formation is attributed to single&#8208;electron transfer from each ligand sub&#8208;pocket to the Pd(II) center accommodated in a d8 square&#8208;planner coordination geometry. Notably, the complexes are interconvertible through doubly one&#8208;electron redox processes, demonstrating a reversible metal coordination rearrangement via thiophene ring flipping within a porphyrinoid framework. This work establishes the first example of such tunable metal coordination, offering a precise strategy for modulating closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell biradical states. In addition, while complex 2 displays intense absorption and photoacoustic responses to the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) light in water after encapsulation within nanoparticles, the nanocomposites encapsulating biradicaloid 3 exhibits enhanced responsiveness in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region.

         <title>Selective Leaflet&#8208;Anchored DNA Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Monitoring of Juxta&#8208;Plasma Membrane Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusogenic nanoliposomes were developed to effectively anchor amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. By combining this strategy with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, precise functionalization of both membrane leaflets could be achieved, thereby enabling simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments. 








Abstract
The cell membrane functions as a bidirectional interface that coordinates the selective transport of substances and information between the interior and exterior of the cell. Simultaneous monitoring of both the inner and outer local environments surrounding this lipid bilayer is crucial for elucidating various cellular activities but significantly challenged by the lack of technologies capable of precisely engineering biosensing probes on both membrane leaflets. In this work, by developing fusogenic nanoliposomes with high cell fusion efficiency, we successfully anchored amphiphilic DNA tetrahedral probes onto the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By integrating this with the direct anchoring of amphiphilic probes on the outer leaflet, we achieved precise functionalization of both leaflets of the cell membrane, thus enabling simultaneous monitoring of localized targets within their respective juxta&#8208;plasma membrane environments, avoiding signal contamination caused by the optical diffraction limit. Using selectively dual&#8208;leaflet&#8208;anchored tetrahedral DNAzyme probes, we revealed that the transmembrane ion channel SLC41A1 synergistically modulated the influx of Na+ and the efflux of Mg2+ in live cells. With a modular design, this membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoplatform can be readily extended for the study of bilateral interface&#8208;dominant cellular processes, shifting the paradigm toward a more localized and subtle perspective.

         <title>Bio&#8208;sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#8211;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from biosourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion Efficiency by Promoting the Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Pathway via Modulating the Main Electron Transition Orbital</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production involves coupling oxygen reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions. However, the low efficiency of water oxidation constrains the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen peroxide conversion efficiency under natural conditions. The two&#8208;electron water oxidation pathway holds potential for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, yet its regulatory mechanisms and detailed understanding remain inadequately explored. Herein, we construct donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers with pyrene as the electron donor and triazine as the electron acceptor. By optimizing the connecting positions of the electron acceptors at the 2,7 positions of the electron donors, the main excited state is regulated from S1 to S2, leading to the electron transition from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital. This modulation effectively enhances the oxidation capacity of the photocatalyst, enabling it to undergo two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production. Consequently, the WOR activity reaches a remarkable efficiency of 2560 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, corresponding to a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of up to 0.94%. This strategy of modulating electronic transition orbitals to enhance the water oxidation capacity of the material significantly improves photocatalytic performance and facilitates its application in natural environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify an RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkyl guanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst. SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8211; using CH4 in Homogenous Rhenium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present Re catalysis of one&#8208;pot synthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8211; using CH4 as a reductant under UV light irradiation at room temperature and normal pressure. NO3&#8211; leads to environmental issues such as water contamination, eutrophication and biodiversity loss. In a natural system and a sewage facility, NO3&#8211; can be detoxified to N2 using hydrogen donors by microbial process. However, it is better to convert NO3&#8211; to NH3 rather than N2. To develop a desirable process of NO3&#8211; to NH3 for a sustainable society, it is required that the reducing agent is derived from a renewable resource/energy. Thus, we turned our attention to CH4, which has high affinity with renewable resource/energy since it can be produced from livestock waste. Therefore, our system reported here is to directly convert NO3&#8211; to NH3 using CH4 with light energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate Distribution Structured Anisotropic Inorganic Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Cycle and High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries owing to their favorable rheological properties and interfacial compatibility with cathodes and Li anodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity and low modulus lead to inferior electrochemical performance and dendrite growth. Herein, we developed a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte comprising vermiculite sheets and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with multivariate distribution and an anisotropic structure. Within this assembly, some vermiculite sheets were suspended in the PVDF matrix to facilitate Li salt dissociation and Li+ transport, while others were tiled on the electrolyte surface, generating a dense, high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase via in&#8208;situ electrochemical reduction, which further improved interfacial kinetics and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, a high conductivity of 1.38 mS cm&#8722;1 was achieved at room temperature, and the solid&#8208;state Li||Li cells displayed robust stability over 3000 h. The all solid&#8208;state LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||Li full cells delivered a specific capacity of 172 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4 mAh cm&#8722;2) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Interactions between Hydrophobic Tag&#8208;conjugated DNA Nanoprobes and Cell Membrane Facilitates ATP Imaging in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugating hydrophobic tags to oligonucleotides facilitates the swift and efficient creation of membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoprobes. However, the membrane&#8208;anchoring of these hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) lacks specificity among different cell types. To address this challenge, we herein report a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy for selectively anchoring HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells. In our design, HT&#8208;DNPs with extended or compact conformations possess weak or strong interactions with cell membrane, respectively. Thus, interactions between HT&#8208;DNPs and cell membrane can be dynamically controlled by altering the conformation of HT&#8208;DNPs. Initially, the extended HT&#8208;DNPs exhibit poor membrane&#8208;anchoring ability which is impute to their weak hydrophobic interactions with cell membrane. However, in slightly acidic conditions, HT&#8208;DNPs intercalated with DNA i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences can fold into a compact conformation and exhibit strong hydrophobicity, thus achieving selective and efficient anchoring of HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells in such environments. Utilizing this method, we constructed HT&#8208;DNPs for imaging of ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results indicate that these HT&#8208;DNPs can effectively accumulate at tumor sites for specific ATP imaging following intravenous injection. This strategy paves new avenues for the selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with various membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanostructures, including DNA nanoprobes, DNA nanocircuits, and DNA nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Co&#8208;Recycling: Selective Oxidation of Polyethylene to Dicarboxylic Acids over Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastics poses critical challenges to environmental integrity and resource sustainability. Here, we report a synergistic co&#8208;recycling strategy for spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes and waste polyethylene (PE), leveraging the catalytic properties of LCO to oxidize PE into high&#8208;value dicarboxylic acids. Through a combination of density functional theory calculations, electron spin resonance, and in situ infrared spectroscopy, we reveal that lithium&#8208;deficient LCO undergoes a spin&#8208;state transition of Co3+ to a high&#8208;spin state, facilitating the activation of oxygen and the generation of singlet oxygen. This reactive oxygen species drives the selective oxidation of PE via hydrogen atom transfer, achieving dicarboxylic acid yields of up to 77.5 wt%, markedly exceeding previous benchmarks. Validation with real&#8208;world plastic waste and spent batteries underscores the feasibility of this approach, presenting a sustainable paradigm&#8208;shift solution for the efficient management of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastic waste in a circular economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potentiality in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in&#8208;situ constructing oriented COF based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2&#160;induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2&#160;synthesis. Experimental reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2&#160;(TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high&#160;photocatalytic H2O2&#160;yield of 8154 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1, which is ~2.5 times and ~4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2&#160;performance. The new strategy of in&#8208;situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2&#160;will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Hopping&#8208;type Charge Transport in Controllably p&#8208;doped Polaronic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we find that controllable p&#8208;type doping leads to Holstein&#8208;type polarons in four electron&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs). Substoichometrically injecting holes into these 2DPs leads to small optical bandgaps (&lt;1.0 eV) and electrical conductivities (17 mS m&#8208;1) significantly higher than their undoped analogs. Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy both reveal that this arises from the formation of paramagnetic polarons. We achieve the maximal conductivities when 2DPs comprised of electron&#8208;rich nodes and electron&#8208;rich linkers are combined, which is a consequence of more delocalized polarons unveiled by diffuse&#8208;reflectance UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Variable&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity measurements reveal two distinct Arrhenius regimes in all 2DPs investigated, which we attribute to the different thermally activated processes inherent to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane electronic transport in stacked 2DP multilayers. This resulted in a maximum electronic conductivity of 326 mS m&#8208;1 at an elevated temperature. Collectively, this report provides fundamental insight into polaron&#8208;based charge&#8208;transport in p&#8208;type 2D organic layers, which we expect will form the foundation for the eventual deployment of these materials in electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Richest Molecular Complex: Ligand&#8208;Length Facilitated Cu40H38 Nanoclusters Exhibiting High Catalytic Performance for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper hydride clusters are extensively studied for their significant potential catalysis. Although clusters with a high hydride content are particularly intriguing, they present considerable synthetic challenges. Herein, we report two copper hydride clusters, Cu18H16 and Cu40H38, which exhibit similar layered structures and components, albeit differing in size. The larger&#8208;sized Cu40H38 with more hydrides was achieved through ligand&#8208;length modulation by replacing 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) in synthesis of Cu18H16 with 1,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane (dpppe). Cu40H38 is remarkable for i) the highest number of hydrides among known molecular compounds, ii) the highest number of unligated copper atoms and the highest metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in copper hydride clusters. Moreover, catalytic studies on the selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds demonstrate that Cu40H38 is a promising catalyst and provide clear structural evidence that a less sterically hindered cluster surface, with a high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio, is beneficial for high&#8208;performance catalysis. The findings highlight the importance of surface composition and ligand coverage in catalytic efficiency and offer new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance copper hydride cluster catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cation Modulation in Hybrid Zirconium Halides for High&#8208;Performance Flexible X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting novel materials featuring high&#8208;quality zero&#8208;dimensional structure, remarkable lattice stability, and minimal defects represents an efficacious strategy for enhancing the detection performance of X&#8208;ray scintillators. Here, we design and synthesize two novel, lead&#8208;free, zirconium&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs), C14H40N4ZrCl8 and C6H16N2ZrCl6. Based on the steric hindrance effect of organic cations, the distance between [ZrCl6]2&#8208; polyhedra was designed and the electronic coupling interactions among polyhedra were adjusted, thus precisely engineering excellent zero&#8208;dimensional materials. Simultaneously, the stronger N&#8208;H+&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8208; (interstitial) bond is introduced to avoid structural instabilities and more defects due to the bigger organic cation in C14H40N4ZrCl8. As expected, C14H40N4ZrCl8 exhibits more remarkable luminescence behavior compared to C6H16N2ZrCl6 when excited by UV light and X&#8208;rays. The photophysics process involving self&#8208;trapped excitons and defects is elaborately expounded using first&#8208;principles calculations, luminescence properties, and stabilities. Finally, a flexible and large&#8208;area scintillation screen with a size of up to 200&#215;100 mm2 based on C14H40N4ZrCl8 is fabricated and attains a high spatial resolution of 21.35 lp mm&#8208;1 and a lower limit of detection of 2.270 &#956;Gyair s&#8208;1, outperforming the resolution of most blue&#8208;emitting scintillation screens. These results imply that the zirconium&#8208;based OIMHs possess significant potential applications for medical diagnostics, security scanning, and non&#8208;destructive testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Functionalized Linear Alkyl Chains in Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors Enable 19.2% Efficiency and Stable As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and stable as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double&#8208;fibril morphology of active layer through single&#8208;step processing is challenging. Herein, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;N6 and BTP&#8208;V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as&#8208;cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face&#8208;on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP&#8208;V6 featuring vinyl&#8208;functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking during rapid film&#8208;formation process, and engenders the formation of a refined double&#8208;fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;V6 based device attained a record&#8208;shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as&#8208;cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis with Near&#8208;Ideal Selectivity and Carbon Efficiency Enabled by Overcoming Its Inherent Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) in acid tends to be a promising route to avoid CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, high alkali cation concentrations (typically &#8805;3 M) are required to activate CO2 and suppress water electroreduction, causing carbonate formation and thus unsatisfied single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade&#8208;off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide&#8208;modification strategy to overcome this trade&#8208;off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1 M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon&#8208; and electron&#8208;efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx  Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#8208;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303 K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2 &#8722; 8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623 &#8722; 773 K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723 K over 150 hours. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured &#960;&#8208;electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short&#8208;peptide could utilize its free amine (&#946;&#8208;alanine) to catalyze C&#8208;C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress Ostwald ripening/coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration.&#160; This out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas)&#8208;based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility. &#160;However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications. &#160;Herein, we introduce a novel class of star&#8208;shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems. &#160;These crRNAs are synthesized via single&#8208;site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified. &#160;By integrating distinct photo&#8208;responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously. &#160;This method demonstrated robust OFF&#8208;ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation. &#160;Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation. &#160;Due to its target sequence&#8208;independent, single&#8208;site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes. &#160;Future advancements incorporating long&#8208;wavelength responsive and reversible linkers promise further enhancement of tissue penetration and control, significantly broadening the applicability and impact of this approach in biological research and therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Cobalt&#8208;Based Perovskite via Regulating Reaction Pathway through Donation&#8208;Back&#8208;Donation Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic approach of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia, known as the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR), has garnered significant attention due to its environmental benefits and potential for supporting a decentralized agricultural economy. However, the underlying chemistry governing the reaction pathways remains poorly understood, hindering the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient eNRR catalysts. Here we report the enhancement of the electrocatalytic eNRR activity of perovskite oxides by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back donation&#8221; mechanism. This is achieved by controlling the spin state via adjusting the distribution of d orbital electrons in low&#8208;cost transition metals, such as cobalt. Specifically, the cobalt in perovskite SrCoO3 (SC) with a low&#8208;spin state demonstrates an 18 times higher ammonia yield rate compared to that in Co3O4 and 1.5 times higher than cobalt in perovskite LaCoO3 (LC). The low spin states of cobalt in SC enable better control of the eNRR reaction pathway over the transformation of *N2H to *NHNH or *NNH2, resulting in alternating hydrogenation in SC rather than distal hydrogenation in LC with a high spin state. The unprecedented improvement in eNRR by regulating the spin state of Co demonstrates the bright of low&#8208;cost Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for ammonia production.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Catalysts Based on N&#8208;(Hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide for Photopolymerization and 3D Printing under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalytic systems are widely used in free radical polymerization as an important photoinitiating approach. However, many reported photoredox catalytic systems are limited by their low stabilities, high excitation powers, and low initiating efficiencies upon excitation in the visible region. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop efficient photoinitiating systems for photopolymerization under visible light. In this work, three new effective photosensitizers from N&#8208;(hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide derivatives namely 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI), 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI&#8208;Br) and 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione 6,6&#8208;dioxide (BTXIO), were designed by density functional theory calculation and synthesized as photoredox catalysts for visible light induced photopolymerization. When combined with initiators such as oxidants i.e. bis(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate or sulfonium salts (i.e., thianthrenium salts, phenoxathiinium salt, phenothiazinium salt, dibenzothiophenium salt) and the reductant ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate to form three&#8208;component initiating systems, they showed good to high performance in visible light photo polymerizations with LED@405nm and LED@450nm. In addition, these photoinitiating systems enable the successful digital light processing and direct laser writing of 3D structures with high resolution, demonstrating a promising strategy for 3D printing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy and Dopant Co&#8208;Constructed Active Microregion in Ru&#8211;MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 for Enhanced Acidic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped low crystalline&#8208;crystalline MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 hybrid material was designed. The region containing Ru atom and/or O vacancy is innovatively defined as the active microregion. The Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bonds with shorter bond lengths provide satisfactory preconditions for the electronic structure modulation of O atoms. The &#8710;GH* of electron&#8208;rich O atoms is close to 0, which can effectively enhance the catalytic activity of HER.








Abstract
Accurate identification of catalytic active regions is crucial for the rational design and construction of hydrogen evolution catalysts as well as the targeted regulation of their catalytic performance. Herein, the low crystalline&#8208;crystalline hybrid MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 with unsaturated coordination and rich defects is taken as the precursor. Through the Joule heating reaction, the Ru&#8208;doped MoO3&#8722;x/Mo2AlB2 catalyst is successfully constructed. Building on the traditional view that individual atoms or vacancies act as active sites, this article innovatively proposes the theory that vacancies and doped atoms synergistically construct active microregions, and multiple electron&#8208;rich O atoms within the active microregions jointly serve as hydrogen evolution active sites. Based on X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations, there is a strong electron transfer among Ru atoms, Mo atoms, and O atoms, leading to extensive O atoms with optimized electronic structure in the active microregions. These O atoms exhibit an H* adsorption free energy close to zero, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. This work provides a brand&#8208;new strategy for the design and preparation of electrocatalytic materials and the systematic regulation of the local electronic structure of catalysts.

         <title>Nitrogen Insertion via Asymmetric Condensation and Chirality Transfer: A Stereodivergent Entry to Cyanocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of cyanocyclopropanes is achieved via asymmetric nitrogen insertion into prochiral cyclobutanones. Key mechanistic steps involve an organocatalyzed asymmetric condensation followed by chirality transfer via an intercepted Neber rearrangement. The reaction can be conducted in a one&#8208;pot, stereodivergent manner, allowing access to all possible cyclopropane isomers with precise control of stereochemistry.








Abstract
The condensation of prochiral cyclobutanones and diphenylphosphinyl hydroxylamine is achieved under Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. Interestingly, the competing aza&#8208;Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction is completely suppressed and the axially chiral oxime esters can be isolated in excellent yield and selectivity (up to 96% yield, up to 97:3 er). Computational analysis highlights the crucial role of the Br&#248;nsted acid in facilitating a successful condensation. Building on the inherent reactivity of the corresponding oxime esters, a one&#8208;pot protocol toward cyanocyclopropanes was discovered, which establishes two consecutive stereocenters. This unusual ring contraction is triggered by strong base and permits an axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality transfer with good enantiospecificity (up to 98% es). Fine&#8208;tuning the reaction parameters enables stereodivergent access to both diastereomers of the cyanocyclopropanes, and the utility of this method is demonstrated through the formal synthesis of the drug tasimelteon.

         <title>Self&#8208;Compartmented Electrolyte Design for Stable Cycling of Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte: A novel electrolyte concept utilizing LiTDI enables a high&#8208;concentration, anion&#8208;rich interfacial region and a low&#8208;concentration bulk electrolyte. This unique design simultaneously enhances interfacial stability and ion transport kinetics in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrolyte is the key component dictating lithium battery performance, especially under extreme conditions such as fast cycling and low temperatures. However, conventional electrolyte design principles, which generally rely on a homogeneous mixture of solvents, salts, and functional additives, fail to simultaneously meet the requirements for both anodic/cathodic interfacial stability and bulk ion&#8208;transport kinetics in lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present a self&#8208;compartmented electrolyte design methodology. Lithium 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ide (LiTDI), featuring the ability to selectively self&#8208;assemble on the cathode/electrolyte interface, compartmented the electrolyte into a heterogonous one. Close to the cathode side, LiTDI could induce an interfacial high&#8208;concentration region, where the anion&#8208;rich solvation structure facilitates the formation of a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). In the bulk, the electrolyte maintains a low concentration with low viscosity, ensuring fast ion transport and superior rate performance. Li||NCM811 cells achieve over 500 stable cycles with 80.3% capacity retention and deliver 169.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a 10C discharge rate. Under low&#8208;temperature conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), the cells maintained outstanding stability over 700 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge, achieving capacity retention of 96.6% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. This work provides a new electrolyte design paradigm, addressing the critical challenges of LMBs for high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Mn(II)&#8208;Based Hybrid Halide Ionogel Scintillator Film for Large&#8208;Area and High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a versatile approach for the rapid synthesis of luminescent Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#8208;IG) by in situ forming zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during monomer polymerization. The Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (with transmittance approaching 90% at 550&#8211;1100&#160;nm) and uniform, high&#8208;efficiency emission. Leveraging its processability, we have fabricated an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillating film and successfully achieved large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This simple and rapid synthesis method on ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators and also opens up a new avenue for the in situ construction of uniform 0D halide&#8208;polymer composites.








Abstract
Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)&#8208;based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C20H20P]+ cations and [MnBr4]2&#8722; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn&#8208;IG and the homogeneous distribution of self&#8208;trapped [MnBr4]2&#8722; light&#8208;emitting units with [C20H20P]+ cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm&#8208;1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly&#8208;efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large&#8208;area and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low&#8208;process&#8208;demand preparation of large&#8208;area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.

Leveraging its processability, we have fabricated an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillating film and successfully achieved large-area and high-resolution X-ray imaging. This simple and rapid synthesis method on ionogels paves the way for the low-process preparation of large-area scintillators and also opens up a new avenue for the in situ construction of uniform 0D halide-polymer composites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionalized ionogels have attracted significant attention in chemical design of new materials and versatile applications, which are formed by polymer network as a matrix with introducing ionic liquids containing characteristic units as a dispersion medium. Here, we present an universal scheme to rapidly synthesize luminescent ionogels through the in situ formation of zero-dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides during the polymerization of monomer. In particular, Mn(II)-based hybrid halide ionogels (Mn&#9472;IG) were formed by incorporating [C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;P]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and [MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions into the polymer network structure. Thanks to the amorphous nature of Mn-IG and the homogeneous distribution of self-trapped [MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; light-emitting units with [C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;P]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, Mn&#9472;IG exhibits high transparency (nearly 90% transmittance at 550&#160;nm-1100&#160;nm) and homogeneous highly-efficient emission. Taking advantage of its processability, we fabricate an 18&#160;cm&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;cm scintillation film and successfully realize large-area and high-resolution X-ray imaging. The straightforward and rapid synthesis method on such ionogels paves the way for the low-process-demand preparation of large-area scintillators, and also opens up new routes for the in situ construction of uniform 0D metal halide polymer composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of Chiral Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecules with Diverse Enantiomers and Polar Column Alignments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given that chiral bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are stacked straight forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assembly, eight assemblies with different symmetries can be considered. In this study, seven of eight assemblies are selectively synthesized with minimal alternations in their molecular structures. These assemblies will be useful for the quantitative discussion for structure&#8211;property relationship.







Abstract
Symmetry is an important factor in material design. Generally, it is difficult to quantitively discuss symmetry&#8208;property relations. Two materials only with symmetry differences are requisite to verify whether polar or nonpolar chiral systems are advantageous for a specific property/phenomenon, such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity. However, it is difficult to selectively prepare materials having different symmetries without changing other physical properties. The current study successfully prepared seven exceptionally similar crystals with different symmetries in terms of polarity, chirality, and enantiomer alignments, which affords ideal materials for the abovementioned studies. Furthermore, we revealed a universal guiding principle on the self&#8208;assembly pattern of bowl&#8208;shaped molecules to predict the resultant assembled structures with the help of molecular dynamics simulations.

We report the first bis(pinacolato)diboron&#8208;enabled Ni&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to synthetically valuable chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols via axial chirality transfer to central chirality.

Abstract
Chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols are important structural motifs in functional materials, pharmaceuticals, and bioactive molecules. Hence, developing efficient methodologies for synthesizing compounds featuring these privileged scaffolds represents a crucial pursuit within synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a regio&#8208; and enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#946;&#8208;bromoenones with alkynes, providing convenient access to chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols with high levels of regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity via axial chirality transfer to central chirality. The utilization of an environmentally sustainable bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) is crucial for the success of this asymmetric reductive cyclization reaction. Simultaneously, the mild reaction environment greatly enhances functional group compatibility. This has been demonstrated by the broad substrate scope, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of bioactive compounds or drug molecules, and subsequent transformations. Amongst, it is worth emphasizing that these functionally enriched chiral five&#8208;membered cyclic tertiary alcohols can efficiently participate in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions to synthesize enantioenriched polycyclic and heterocyclic molecules, thereby further validating the significance of introducing a cyclopentadiene skeleton. The preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the mode of action of B2pin2 in mononuclear Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive [3&#160;+&#160;2] annulation reactions and density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the origin of the experimentally observed regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Signal Circuit for Self&#8208;Regulated Bidirectional Communication in Protocell&#8208;Living Cell Communities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercellular communicating protocell with feedback loop was designed for self&#8208;regulating signal transmission in protocell/living cell community. This DNA&#8208;empowered protocell provides a bottom&#8208;up access route toward synthetic cellular systems with abilities for programming desired cellular behaviors.








Abstract
Developing synthetic biology tools to control cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling can provide new capabilities to engineer cell&#8208;cell communication and program desired cellular behaviors. As cell mimics, abiotic protocells provide an attractive opportunity to modulate the intercellular communication with design&#8208;based regulatory features. Despite the chemical communication of protocells that interact with living cells have been demonstrated, the autonomous regulation of intercellular signal transmission in protocell/living cell community remains a critical challenge. Herein, we designed a DNA circuit consisting of a recognition module, activation module, and feedback module that enables protocells to self&#8208;regulate the interaction with living cells by sensing and responding to the signal released from living cells. The feedback module with renewable capability is capable of processing the signal transduction on the membrane surface of protocells and controlling intercellular adhesion. Once dissociated from living cells, the disengaged protocells allow the following interaction with multiple target living cells in succession. Overall, this work provides an avenue to control and program dynamic signal propagation in protocell/living cell community. The designed communication with living cells would open new ways to tune cellular behavior and apply them to cell&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Powerful Regulator to Enhance Electrocatalytic Reaction Kinetics and Thermodynamics: The Ordered Hetero&#8208;Nanowire</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator is presented, which simultaneously couples the merits of the kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis. The periodical arrangement enables the formation of the local electric field to improve mass transfer kinetics, accounting for a significant boost in MOR performance. In addition, the hetero&#8208;NWs undergo the energetically favorable non&#8208;CO pathway, which is not susceptible to the invasion of toxic carbonaceous intermediates and thus ensures long&#8208;term durability for MOR.








Abstract
Optimizing the thermodynamics of electrode reactions is a valid strategy for achieving superior electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). However, as the catalyst downsizes to the nanoscale, the influence of mass transfer kinetics is pronounced in improving electrocatalytic activity. Herein, an ordered hetero&#8208;nanowire (NW) regulator that couples the virtues of kinetics and thermodynamics is reported. Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero&#8208;NWs could construct a uniform electric field, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well&#8208;defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as&#8208;prepared ordered hetero&#8208;NW catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long&#8208;term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.

Finite element analysis demonstrates that the periodic arrangement of hetero-NWs could construct a uniform electric field, promoting the precise mass transfer of reactant molecules and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In addition, the microscopic electronic structure effect of the well-defined catalyst weakens the bonding interaction toward toxic carbonaceous intermediates, which meanwhile strengthens the adsorption of hydroxyl species, critically contributing to enhanced MOR durability. The wide generality of this regulator has been confirmed by a series of as-prepared ordered hetero-NW catalysts, which show prominent electrocatalytic performance, including relatively high mass activity, superior CO resistance, and long-term stability. Therefore, this work reveals the importance of the tandem effect of kinetics and thermodynamics in electrocatalysis, which provides valuable insights for developing customized and highly efficient catalysts for extensive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Arylthianthrenium Salts with (Hetero)aryl (Pseudo)halides via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing complex arylthianthrenium salts and readily available (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides as starting materials, in conjunction with hypoboric acid as a reductant, structurally diverse (hetero)biaryl motifs can be rapidly synthesized via palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Key to this advance is the selective and mild borylation of arylthianthrenium salts, followed by a conventional SMC (Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling) reaction with aryl halides.








Abstract
Herein, we present a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of arylthianthrenium salts at a late stage with diverse (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides under reductive conditions, in which a palladium(0) catalyst differentiates between two aryl electrophiles based on the different rates of oxidative addition of arylthianthrenium salts and aryl halides for selective umpolung. A measured near&#8208;zero Hammett rho value is consistent with oxidative addition of the arylthianthrenium salts to palladium(0) being insensitive to substituent effects, which enables reaction with structurally and electronically diverse arylthianthrenium salts. In addition, we show the robustness of this method by coupling of two complex fragments that would otherwise be difficult to access in a single step.

         <title>Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid&#8208;Infrared Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental&#8208;friendly elemental composition and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2 &#956;m, polydisperse QDs populations and complex size&#8208;selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8 nm to 22.2 nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000 nm, the record among the environmental&#8208;friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way towards environmental&#8208;friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution&#8208;processed QDs into the mid&#8208;infrared regime applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmark Paraffin Adsorption in a Super&#8208;Hydrophobic Porous Coordination Polymer with Blade&#8208;like Circular Phenyl Nanotraps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective capture of paraffin from olefin that permits one&#8208;step purification of olefin is significantly important, yet developing adsorbents with high separation selectivity and hydrophobicity remains a daunting challenge. Although aromatic environments can enhance paraffin affinity and hydrophobicity through nonpolar interactions, water adsorption still occurs in regions distant from the aromatic rings, as well as in secondary pores that are always overlooked. Herein, we reported an ultramicroporous porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) featuring blade&#8208;like circular phenyl paraffin nanotraps. As further validated by DFTB calculations, GCMC simulations, and in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis, these ultramicroporous paraffin nanotraps created by surrounding benzene rings enhance the preferential adsorption of paraffin, and the segmented spaces between adjacent nanotraps in the blade&#8208;like structure combined with hydrophobic petal&#8208;like secondary pore channels enclosed by fluorinated functional groups further mitigates the water co&#8208;adsorption. Remarkably, ZnFPCP exhibited outstanding IAST selectivity of C3H8/C3H6 (2.08) and competitive selectivity of C2H6/C2H4 (2.93) under ambient conditions, while also exhibiting record&#8208;breaking C3H8 and C2H6 uptake at low pressures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated the excellent performance of ZnFPCP in olefin purification, affording the exceptional productivity of ultra&#8208;high purity (99.99%) for C3H6 and C2H4. Robust stability and super hydrophobicity highlight its potential in harsh industrial application scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Potential of Facet Heterojunctions in Platinum Alloys for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition of octahedral PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) to a truncated structure enriches the diversity of catalytic sites. The edge sites, featuring facet heterojunctions, leverage geometric and ligand synergies to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and optimize the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates, leading to superior performance in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).








Abstract
Ensuring high&#8208;quality activity of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) while mitigating the degradation of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts remains challenging. A platinum&#8208;skinned truncated octahedral PtNi alloy with (100)/(111) facet heterostructures is synthesized through a low&#8208;temperature thermally driven etching strategy, demonstrating exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The heterostructure of the Ptskin&#8208;PtNi(111) facet destabilizes the *OOH intermediate and promotes the preferential O&#9472;O bond cleavage, leading to the optimization of ORR pathway. A linear correlation between the generalized coordination number (CN&#175;$\overline {{\mathrm{CN}}} $) and &#916;G*OH demonstrates that the facet hetero&#8208;sites optimize the adsorption of *OH to the theoretically optimal state through ligand and geometric effects. The optimized PNZC&#8208;5A160 catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity (2.97 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V vs. RHE) and superior H2&#8208;O2 single PEMFC performance [mass activity (MA) of 0.5 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free; peak power density of 1.42&#160;W cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. After accelerated stress tests, the loss in MA at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free and in potential at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is only 8% and 3.7&#160;mV, respectively, due to the enhanced binding of subsurface Pt and Ni to surface Pt atoms through Pt skin, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of Pt and Ni.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Carbonylation of Azetidines via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluorocarbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a site&#8208;selective Cu&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of azetidines promoted by difluorocarbene insertion at low temperature, enabling access to a variety of functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes (40 examples). This skeletal expansion strategy provides a distinct disconnection approach to synthesize medicinally relevant five&#8208;membered heterocycles.








Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Lactams are privileged five&#8208;membered pharmaco&#8208;phores in numerous bioactive compounds, but access to these motifs typically relies on cycloaddition/substitution chemistry involving activated substrates or CO carbonylations under harsh conditions. Here, we report a new route to functionalized &#947;&#8208;lactams through formal carbonylation of azetidines under nonprecious metal catalysis. The method leverages a copper&#8208;stabilized difluorocarbene to promote site&#8208;selective insertion followed by in situ hydrolysis to unmask the lactam group. In contrast to most difluorocarbene reactions that cause ring cleavage of saturated heterocycles in the presence of heat, the present system operates at a low temperature and retains the integrity of the cyclic structure. Synthesis of various drug&#8208;like lactams and a therapeutic agent for diabetes highlights utility.

         <title>Biomimetic Hierarchical Construction of Anti&#8208;Tumor Polyoxopalladates for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of lacunary polyoxopalladates resulted in a hierarchical assembly that resembles the construction of biomacromolecules. An ordered structural evolution from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates was achieved by cooperative covalent and supramolecular bonding effects, resulting in enhanced anti&#8208;tumor activity via DNA damage.








Abstract
Inspired by the construction scheme of biomacromolecules, a hierarchical assembly based on the lacunary polyoxopalladate (POP) of [SrPd12O6(OH)3(PhAsO3)6(OAc)3]4&#8722; (SrPd12) has been achieved. As a structurally programmable molecular building block, SrPd12 is used to evolve from monomer via dimer to supramolecular aggregates in a controlled manner. In such process, the open&#8208;shell&#8208;type monomers are covalently integrated into bowl&#8208; or cage&#8208;like dimers via a direct or indirect splicing strategy. Upon that, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic effects are further hired to fabricate supramolecular aggregates of varied host&#8211;guest archetypes, thereby completing a hierarchical construction. In consideration of the combined advantages of noble metals and polyoxometalates in cancer treatment, both in vitro and in vivo&#160;anti&#8208;tumor assays of these SrPd12&#8208;derived POPs were studied in detail. A structure&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;tumor activitywas observed, originating from an imbalance of damage and repair of DNA as anti&#8208;tumor mechanism.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Controlled, Sequential Self&#8208;Sorting of Supramolecular Assemblies in Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox reaction&#8208;mediated transient deactivation strategy has been employed to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular structures in solution and inside model protocells&#8212;an unprecedented architecture in the field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting of cellular components is essential for maintaining order and function in living systems, enabling complex processes to operate seamlessly. Emulating such self&#8208;sorting in synthetic self&#8208;assembly, however, has conventionally relied on structural or chirality mismatches of monomers yielding self&#8208;sorted systems under thermodynamic conditions. In contrast, reaction&#8208;coupled, kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly, ubiquitous in biological systems, is critical for achieving spatiotemporal characteristics. Extending this principle to temporally self&#8208;sorted synthetic assemblies is key to developing multi&#8208;component biomimetic systems. Herein, we present a strategy towards this direction, to achieve sequential self&#8208;sorting of supramolecular assemblies through differences in the chemical&#8208;reactivity of monomers, coupled to redox&#8208;reactions. This approach exploits the distinct redox potentials of monomers to achieve precise temporal&#8208;control over self&#8208;sorting, while inherent structural mismatches among monomers ensure the kinetic stability of self&#8208;sorted state. Reduction reactions transiently disrupt their assemblies into dormant inactive monomeric states, while subsequent kinetically controlled reassembly occurs via reversible oxidation reactions. Finally, utilizing this sequential self&#8208;sorting, we aim to mimic multicomponent cellular self&#8208;organization by demonstrating the kinetically controlled growth of self&#8208;sorted structures in the presence of model protocells, using lipid vesicles as compartments. Although spatial&#8208;distribution remains non&#8208;selective, the dormant monomeric states facilitate monomer encapsulation and the unprecedented stepwise&#8208;formation of self&#8208;sorted assemblies within model protocells.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1&#8208;Aryl Isoquinolines via De Novo Isoquinoline Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is reported. An enantioselective de novo isoquinoline ring formation is involved in this process. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step of the reaction and the origin of enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Axially chiral heterobiaryl moieties serve as core skeletons for bioactive molecules, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. Enantioselective de novo formation of the heteroaromatic ring is one of the most straightforward approaches to access enantioenriched heterobiaryls. Herein, an enantioselective de novo construction of isoquinolines by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation/annulation of aromatic imines with alkynes is disclosed. This approach is operationally simple, allowing for rapid access to a variety of axially chiral 1&#8208;aryl isoquinolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 98% yield and 99:1 er). The synthetic application of the current method was demonstrated by functional group transformations and suitability for millimolar&#8208;scale reactions. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed the turnover&#8208;limiting step and provided insight into the origin of the enantioselectivity for this reaction.

         <title>Oligoether Chain Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhancing Transport Pathways and Oxygen Reduction Activity for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligoether chain engineering in covalent organic frameworks with hydrophilic ethylene oxide&#8208;based structures enhances mass diffusion and facilitates the formation of OOH* intermediate in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics and high selectivity for the two&#8208;electron pathway in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
Oligoethers with various numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) units, known for their flexibility, electronegativity, and hydrophilicity, can be leveraged to construct complex molecular architectures with broad applicability. In this study, we present the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating oligoethers with EO segments of varying lengths (2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EOs) to explore the role of EO units in modulating the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway for electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. By embedding hydrophilic EO side chains into the hydrophobic frameworks, intermolecular interactions are promoted through hydrogen bonding, leading to the self&#8208;assembly and spatial aggregation of these side chains. The high crystallinity of the COFs facilitates orderly stacking of the skeleton, creating hydrophilic nanoscale transport channels that enhance ORR kinetics. Among the synthesized COFs, 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;EO1, which contains one EO group, exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 5820&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 89.2%. Theoretical calculations and in situ electrocatalytic experiments reveal that the elongation of the EO units significantly alters the electronic structure of carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen atoms, lowering the energy barriers associated with the formation of OOH* intermediates and thus promoting the 2e&#8722; ORR pathway. This work offers valuable insights into optimizing COFs with different EO units for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR&#8208;based electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Alcohol Activation by Benzodithiolylium for Deoxygenative Alkylation Driven by Photocatalytic Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Benzodithiolylium cation was identified as an alcohol&#8208;activating reagent for energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical alkylation, avoiding electron transfer. Photocatalytic deoxygenative coupling reactions of alcohols with diverse oxime carbonates involving selective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction are presented, including energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven carboimination of alkenes, energy transfer (EnT)/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;coupling, and cyclization cross&#8208;coupling. 








Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;benzodithiolylium (BDT) cation was identified as an efficient hydroxyl&#8208;activating reagent for the photocatalytic deoxygenative radical functionalization of alcohols in the absence of any electron transfer process. A series of unprecedented photocatalytic energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;driven deoxygenative radical coupling reactions of alcohols with bifunctional oxime carbonates have been developed based on the activation by BDT. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond construction facilitates the heteroselective cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.

Nickel-catalyzed radical sorting followed by C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond construction facilitates the heteroselective cross-coupling of two distinct alkyl radicals originating from parallel radical relays. These reactions allow the versatile synthesis of diverse nitrogen-containing molecules, including amino acid derivatives, imines, nitriles, and pyrrolines, by using ubiquitous alcohols as regiodefined alkyl building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions</title>

A regiodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using aldehydes and silylboranes has been developed, with ligand control influencing the reaction pathway. The employment of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, whereas using (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine leads to 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity.








Abstract
The regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes presents a formidable challenge due to inherently complex selectivity control over multiple potential reaction pathways. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent carbosilylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes and silylboranes, achieving unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity using nickel catalysts with distinct phosphine ligands. The use of triethylphosphine promotes 4,3&#8208;addition selectivity, while employing (2&#8208;biphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine facilitates 4,1&#8208;addition selectivity. This method displays excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as a broad substrate scope and substantial functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ligand choice is crucial for directing the reaction pathway and stabilizing &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;nickel intermediates. Our protocol provides a practical and efficient approach to synthesizing valuable functionalized allylsilanes, which are important in various synthetic applications.

         <title>Superfast Protein Desulfurization Triggered by Low&#8208;Energy Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) has been developed to enable superfast and clean desulfurization under exceptionally mild conditions. The utility of LEnVLD was demonstrated through the clean desulfurization of a wide range of peptide and protein substrates, and its convenience and robustness facilitated the application of LEnVLD in versatile reaction scenarios such as solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization.








Abstract
The combination of transthioesterification&#8208;based ligation of thiol&#8208;derived amino acids and the post&#8208;ligation desulfurization has greatly expanded the scope of modern chemical protein synthesis. Here, we report a new strategy of low&#8208;energy visible light&#8208;induced desulfurization (LEnVLD) that enables superfast and clean protein desulfurization (half life =&#160;1.7&#160;s) with improved reaction selectivity compared to the previous methods. The LEnVLD method can be easily carried out under very mild conditions using only a catalytic amount of fluorescent dye and household flashlight (ca. 5&#160;W) irradiation, eliminating the need for any pyrophoric reagent, thiol additives, or excessive radical initiators, and its practicality was demonstrated by the fast and high&#8208;yielding desulfurization of more than 30 peptide and protein substrates bearing a variety of sensitive functional groups (e.g., Thz, N&#8208;alkylated maleimide, and thioester). Moreover, the convenience and robustness of LEnVLD enable its extension to versatile reaction scenarios (e.g., solid&#8208;supported desulfurization and flow chemistry&#8208;based desulfurization) that would enhance the practical capability of chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Aromatic Lactones into Bioisosteres by Carbonyl&#8208;to&#8208;Boranol Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed group&#8208;exchange strategy has been developed for the direct conversion of aromatic lactones into cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and the synthetic value of this strategy. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to the rapid modification of lactone cores in bioactive molecules underscores its practical utility.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement is an important strategy in drug discovery and is commonly practiced in medicinal chemistry; however, the incorporation of bioisosteres typically requires laborious multistep de novo synthesis. The direct conversion of a functional group into its corresponding bioisostere is of particular significance in evaluating structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;exchange strategy that enables the direct conversion of aromatic lactones, a prevalent motif in bioactive molecules, into their corresponding cyclic hemiboronic acid bioisosteres. Scope evaluation and product derivatization experiments demonstrate the synthetic value and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility of this strategy, while the application of this methodology to the rapid remodeling of chromenone cores in bioactive molecules highlights its utility.

         <title>Separation of MnWOx and NaWSiOx Phases Boosts Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite of MnWOx and NaWSiOx separated at the nanoscale shows promising performances for the oxidative coupling of CH4, offering C2&#8211;3 selectivity of 79% with a ratio of olefins/paraffins of 2.2 at a CH4 conversion of 32% at 775&#160;&#176;C. The use of MnWOx instead of MnOx regulates the redox property and suppresses the deep oxidation of CH4. The composite catalyst shows a significant synergistic effect in the formation of C2&#8211;C3 products. The active oxygen species formed on MnWOx is proposed to migrate to NaWSiOx, where the selective activation and coupling of CH4 is accelerated.








Abstract
The oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is an attractive approach for methane transformations, but achieving a satisfactory combination of activity and selectivity remains challenging, even with the promising Mn&#8211;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. Herein, we demonstrate that nanoscale separation of Mn&#8208;based and Na2WO4&#8208;based phases results in a highly efficient catalyst, achieving a remarkable 79% selectivity for C2&#8211;C3 hydrocarbons at a 32% CH4 conversion at 775&#160;&#176;C, outperforming most previously reported catalysts. Our studies reveal that MnWOx phases with adjustable surface Mn/W ratios and redox activities are more effective for the selective activation of O2, thereby enhancing the OCM of CH4. The assembly of MnWOx and Na2WO4/SiO2 components in nanoscale proximity significantly promotes the formation of C2&#8211;C3 hydrocarbons by suppressing deep oxidation. We propose a bifunctional mechanism involving the transfer of active oxygen species from MnWOx to Na2WO4/SiO2, which induces selective activation and coupling of CH4 on the Na2WO4/SiO2 surface.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Celluxanthenes, Antibacterial Arylpolyene Alkaloids From Diverse Cellulose&#8208;Degrading Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and biosynthetic origin of the enigmatic &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS) from the anaerobe thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) were elucidated. YAS is a complex of unusual antibacterial arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes) that are produced by various cellulolytic anaerobes.








Abstract
Cellulose degradation by anaerobic bacteria plays an eminent role in the global carbon cycle and is a critical step in biofuel production. The anaerobic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum (now: Acetivibrio thermocellus) is particularly efficient at breaking down biomass and produces a &#8220;yellow affinity substance&#8221; (YAS), a pigment that has been implicated in signaling and conferring higher affinity of the cellulosome to YAS&#8208;loaded cellulose. However, the nature and biosynthetic origin of YAS have remained elusive. Here, we show by isolation and structure elucidation that YAS is a complex of unusual arylpolyene alkaloids (celluxanthenes). Stable isotope labeling experiments reveal all biosynthetic building blocks for celluxanthene assembly. Through a targeted gene deletion, we identify the celluxanthene (cex) biosynthesis gene cluster and propose a biosynthetic model in which an arylpolyene generated by an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) undergoes a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion with a tryptophan&#8208;derived ketoacid to form a tetronate. Genome mining and metabolic profiling revealed that diverse cellulolytic anaerobes harbor cex gene loci and produce celluxanthene congeners. Celluxanthenes show antibiotic activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including clinically relevant strains. This study solves the long&#8208;standing enigma surrounding the nature of YAS and lays the groundwork for elucidating the precise biological roles of these intricate pigments.

         <title>An Immediate Bacterial&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Thio&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide: A Real&#8208;Time NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide can be immediately reduced to a supramolecular radical anion by bacteria, leading to a NIR&#8208;II absorption. This strategy effectively raises the reduction potential, thereby greatly boosting the reduction speed. This approach has been used as a real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacterial and opens new horizons for bio&#8208;responsive agents.








Abstract
A new kind of supramolecular thio&#8208;naphthalene diimide (SNDI) which can be immediately reduced as supramolecular radical anion by bacteria is reported. The introduction of thiocarbonyl effectively elevates the reduction potential of SNDI, largely increasing the bacteria&#8208;response speed in hypoxia. It selectively distinguishes the bacteria with high and low reduction ability in real time. The host&#8211;guest complexation of SNDI and cucurbit[7]uril can enhance radical anion quantum yield, ensuring intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and realizing high photothermal conversion. The real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II photothermal anti&#8208;bacteria is successfully carried out. This development will enrich the design of bio&#8208;responsive agent with promising future towards actual application.

         <title>Spherical Nucleic Acids&#8208;Directed Cryosynthesis of Manganese Nanoagents for Tumor Imaging and Therapy</title>

DNA&#8208;templated theranostic manganese nanoparticles synthesized under liquid nitrogen show features of magnetic resonance imaging, gene silencing, and chemodynamic therapy for tumors.








Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based theranostic nanotechnologies that can respond to specific tumor pathophysiological parameters hold great promise for tumor diagnostics and effective treatments. However, their clinical translation is hindered by insufficient intracellular availability of essential metal cofactors required for DNAzyme activation. To overcome this limitation, we developed a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy for fabricating multifunctional DNA&#8208;templated manganese carbonate nanoparticles (DtMnP). The process involves three critical phases: (i) spherical nucleic acid hybrids, DNAzyme&#8208;functionalized AuNPs, serve as scaffolds for spatially controlled Mn2+ deposition through phosphate coordination, initiating heterogeneous nucleation of MnCO3; (ii) rapid liquid nitrogen freezing induces nanoparticle growth along DNA templates; and (iii) lyophilization&#8208;mediated structural stabilization enables convenient long&#8208;term storage. The DtMnP exhibits pH&#8208;responsive dissolution, releasing 90% of Mn2+ within 60&#160;min under tumor microenvironment conditions (pH 5.5). The released Mn2+ ion enables dual functionality: (i) superior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast of MCF&#8208;7 xenograft models with enhanced biosafety, and (ii) synergistic therapeutic efficacy through DNAzyme&#8208;mediated EGR&#8208;1 gene silencing (60% mRNA downregulation) combined with Mn2+&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions generating cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (45% apoptosis in MCF&#8208;7 cells). The cryo&#8208;encapsulated DtMnP exemplifies a flexible and efficient approach for integrating various functional components into a single nanoparticle for tumor theranostic applications.

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Toward Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique solvation environment of sodium cations, brought by their larger ion volume and lower charge density, significantly impacts the physicochemical and interfacial properties of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, highlighting the crucial importance of moving beyond mere mimicry of lithium&#8208;based designs.








Abstract
Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical features of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multivalent cation&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Hyperbranched Polymers via Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the synthesis, characterization, and applications of hyperbranched polymers (HBP) using a divergent ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approach. An ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching monomer, formed by covalently linking a traditional ROMP monomer to a chain transfer agent, was diluted with a linear comonomer to produce branched polymers with controlled molar mass and dispersity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed their globular shape in solution. Additionally, we functionalized HBPs to create core&#8208;shell materials capable of encapsulating organic dyes efficiently. The study also highlights their role in sustainable polymer design, demonstrating degradation under mild acidic conditions. Core&#8208;shell particles synthesized via this approach enabled efficient capture and rapid, on&#8208;demand release of guest molecules, emphasizing their potential in drug delivery and advanced materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Synthetic Pathway to Lanthanide Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes: Selective Expansion of a Sandwich Complex by an Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction pathway is disclosed, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result, a triple&#8208;decker complex is formed, which can also be accessed in a salt metathesis from unprecedented inverse sandwich compounds.








Abstract
Commonly, multi&#8208;decker sandwich complexes can either be formed in a one&#8208;step reaction or in a stepwise fashion by stacking deck by deck. Herein, we showcase a new reaction pathway, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result of the insertion of a cyclocene half&#8208;sandwich fragment {LnII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)} (CotTIPS&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H62&#8722;) into a classical divalent sandwich complex [LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm, Eu, Yb; Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$), the unprecedented triple&#8208;decker sandwich complexes of the type [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)] were obtained. A plausible reaction pathway was determined by quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, we synthesize the same lanthanide sandwich complexes in a traditional, stepwise fashion. For this, we initially present the novel inverse sandwich compounds [LnIII(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(thf)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm,&#160;Eu, thf&#160;=&#160;tetrahydrofuran) and [YbII(BH4)(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)YbII(BH4)(thf)2] consisting of a cyclooctatetraene middle deck sandwiched between two divalent lanthanides as precursors. Subsequent salt metathesis reactions with [K(Cnt)] (Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$) gave rise to the title compounds [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)]. The unique feature of these compounds is the combination of the two largest aromatic all&#8208;carbon rings known in coordination chemistry&#8212;the 8&#8208; and 9&#8208;membered rings&#8212;into lanthanide triple&#8208;decker sandwich compounds.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dendritic Oligo&#8208;Glycerol Cationic Surfactants for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal click chemistry approach was used to synthesize a series of cationic surfactants. The results show that an optimal balance between positive charges and hydrophobicity is a crucial factor for the improvement of antibacterial properties. Within our synthesized library, surfactants with a C12 alkyl chain and four positive charges showed remarkable bactericidal activity and antibiofilm effects against drug&#8208;resistant MRSA. In addition, these surfactants significantly promoted wound healing in MRSA&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance present an ever&#8208;increasing threat to human health worldwide, and medicine urgently needs new alternatives for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. Cationic surfactants have proven to be effective antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, inhibit biofilm formation, and combat a broad spectrum of pathogens. We employed a orthogonal click chemistry strategy for the efficient modular synthesis of six novel cationic surfactants. Our results emphasize the strong correlation between the surfactant design and its antibacterial potential. Among these six cationic surfactants we identified a prime candidate, which possessed an impressive antibacterial effect against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria, including drug&#8208;resistant strains. We found that our surfactant can prevent biofilm formation and eradicate already existing biofilms. Cryo&#8208;TEM imaging was used to reveal the membrane&#8208;disrupting properties of the surfactant. In&#8208;vivo wound healing experiments underline the surfactants&#8217; ability to inhibit wound infections. Cationic surfactants often face the challenge of balancing strong antibacterial activity with minimal cytotoxicity. Our strategic design and orthogonal click chemistry approach have enabled precise fine&#8208;tuning of molecular structures to achieve an optimal balance between antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility, effectively overcoming this critical limitation.

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters are realized by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent. The electrolyte with this unique structure can promote to construct robust electrode/electrolyte interphases for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery with a capacity of 3.75 Ah exhibits a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.1 C.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. Exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to carbon monoxide under mild conditions (1 bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5 kcal mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Known boron carbonyl complexes either exploit very high Lewis acidity or a low oxidation state boron centre in order to capture CO. By contrast, we report a carbonyl complex featuring a simple tri&#8208;coordinate borane, characterized by a Lewis acidity which is only marginally higher than B(NMe2)3. {(Ph2P)xanth}3B features a solid&#8208;state structure in which two of the three B&#8208;bound xanth(PPh2) units are projected above the BC3 plane, generating an up, up, down conformation. Quantum chemical methods, however, reveal that the alternative up, up, up alignment, characterized by a cage&#8208;like geometry and enhanced intramolecular noncovalent interactions, is favored significantly in silico (by ca. 33.0&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Although this conformation is optimal for binding polar C3&#8208;symmetric H&#8208;bond donors such as NH3 (and related guests such as H2O and MeNH2) the binding of essentially nonpolar substrates such as CO would be expected to be weak at best. However, exposure of {(Ph2P)xanth}3B to CO under mild conditions (1&#160;bar, 25 &#176;C) reversibly yields {(Ph2P)xanth}3B&#183;CO, a tractable cage&#8208;like borane carbonyl adduct featuring a central BCO moiety shrouded by xanth(PPh2) moieties. Dispersion forces are critical to substrate binding: the two binding modes in which the B&#8208;bound CO guest is located inside/outside the host cage differ in energy by 59.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Remote Spin&#8208;Center Shift Enables Activation of Distal Benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remote spin&#8208;center shift process that involves 1,n&#8208;radical translocation followed by elimination of a leaving group has been developed to enable distal benzylic C&#9472;O and C&#9472;N bond activation. By this process, a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical promoted radical deoxygenative and deaminative functionalization of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines to afford a wide range of alkylated products.








Abstract
A spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) is a radical process that commonly involves a 1,2&#8208;radical shift along with the elimination of an adjacent leaving group by a two&#8208;electron ionic movement. The conventional SCS process is largely limited to 1,2&#8208;radical translocation, while a remote SCS event involving 1,n&#8208;radical translocation over a greater distance to enable distal bond functionalization remains largely underexplored. Herein, we report the boryl radical&#8208;promoted distal deoxygenation and deamination of free benzylic alcohols and simple benzylic amines, respectively, through a remote SCS event. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom of a benzoate or benzamide. Then, radical translocation took place across the aromatic ring to promote benzylic C&#9472;O or C&#9472;N bond cleavage. The resulting radical intermediate subsequently coupled with various alkenes to afford a wide range of alkylated products. The proposed mechanistic pathway was supported by experimental investigations.

         <title>Amphiphilic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Improved CO2 Separation in PIM&#8208;1 Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An improvement in compatibility between filler ZIF&#8208;94 and polymer PIM&#8208;1 in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) was achieved through ligand exchange with undecylimidazole (umIm). The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) presents amphiphilic character and high CO2 adsorption (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0 &#176;C). The MMM with 5&#160;wt.% loading showed a 70% increase in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and 10% higher CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2) compared to pure PIM&#8208;1 membranes.








Abstract
This study aims to enhance the compatibility between filler and polymer in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), addressing an important challenge in membrane development. ZIF&#8208;94, known for its affinity to CO2, was partially modified with 2&#8208;undecylimidazolate (umIm) through the solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method to improve its compatibility with the prototypical polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM&#8208;1. The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) can be considered as an amphiphilic MOF with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, while maintaining a considerably high CO2 adsorption capacity (2.34&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 90&#160;kPa and 0&#160;&#176;C). Gas separation experiments were performed using mixed gas compositions of 15/85 CO2/N2 at 3&#160;bar and 35 &#176;C. The resulting MMM with a 5&#160;wt.% loading exhibited an enhanced CO2 separation performance, with ca. 70% and 10% increases in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2), respectively, compared to pristine PIM&#8208;1 membranes. In addition, thin film nanocomposite membranes were prepared showing a 23.5 CO2/N2 selectivity at 2350 GPU of CO2. This modification strategy shows a great potential for improving the CO2 capture technologies, highlighting the potential of tailoring MOF fillers for advanced membrane materials in gas separation applications.

         <title>Engineering Bodipy&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Spectrum Photocatalysis in Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly&#160;stable bodipy&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (BMOFs) were synthesized by treating dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Featuring the distinct bodipy scaffold in the framework, these BMOFs displayed high reactivity in heterogenous photocatalytic C&#9472;H bond&#160;activation of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to access amides under visible light.








Abstract
Developing photocatalysts that can efficiently utilize the full solar spectrum is a crucial step toward transforming sustainable energy solutions. Due to their light absorption limitations, most photo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constrained to the ultraviolet (UV) and blue light regions. Expanding their absorption to encompass the entire solar spectrum would unlock their full potential, greatly enhancing efficiency and applicability. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of highly stable boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (bodipy)&#8208;based MOFs (BMOFs) by reacting dicarboxyl&#8208;functionalized bodipy ligands with Zr&#8208;oxo clusters. Leveraging the acidity of the methyl groups on the bodipy backbone, we expanded the conjugation system through a solid&#8208;state condensation reaction with various aldehydes, achieving full&#8208;color absorption, thereby extending the band edge into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) regions. These BMOFs demonstrated exceptional reactivity and recyclability in heterogeneous photocatalytic activities, including C&#9472;H bond activation of saturated aza&#8208;heterocycles and C&#9472;N bond cleavage of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines to produce amides under visible light. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of BMOFs in photocatalysis, marking a significant leap forward in the design of advanced photocatalytic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Decoding the Chemical Language of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides from the Untapped Archaea Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary metabolites (SMs) are essential across all life domains, yet those originating from the Archaea domain remain poorly understood. Here, the systematic genome mining and the pioneering heterologous expression of archaeal SMs have revealed the chemical landscape of archaeal lanthipeptides, showing both canonical and non&#8208;canonical forms. These lanthipeptides exhibit antagonistic activity and activate the host's motility, likely shaping the archaeal community and mediating environmental adaptation.








Abstract
Chemical communication is crucial in ecosystems with complex microbial communities. However, the difficulties inherent to the cultivation of archaea have led to a limited understanding of their chemical language, especially regarding the structure diversity and function of secondary metabolites (SMs). Our in&#8208;depth exploration into the biosynthetic potential of archaea has unveiled the previously unexplored biosynthetic capabilities and chemical diversity of archaeal ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Through the first application of heterologous expression in archaeal SM discovery, we have identified 24 lanthipeptides, including a distinctive type featuring diamino&#8208;dicarboxylic termini. It highlights the uniqueness of archaeal biosynthetic pathways and significantly expands the chemical landscape of archaeal SMs. Additionally, archaeal lanthipeptides demonstrate antagonistic activity against haloarchaea, mediating the unique biotic interaction in the halophilic niche. They showcase a new ecological role of RiPPs in enhancing the host's motility by inducing the rod&#8208;shaped cell morphology and upregulating the archaellin gene expression, facilitating the archaeal interaction with abiotic environments. These discoveries broaden our understanding of archaeal chemical language and provide promising prospects for future exploration of SM&#8208;mediated interaction.

         <title>Capturing Unstable Carbanionic Intermediates via Halogen Transfer: Base&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling Reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merger of deprotonation and halogenation into compatible processes provides a new strategy for functionalizing traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates, including &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanions. This capability is leveraged toward the first general method for oxidative coupling of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylarenes with common pronucleophiles to produce valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic (thio)ethers.








Abstract
We describe how the merger of deprotonation, halogenation, and substitution into compatible processes enables the productive functionalization of traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates. This strategy enables the first oxidative coupling protocol of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic C&#9472;H bonds with heteronucleophiles. Here, transiently generated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanionic intermediates undergo halogen transfer from 2&#8208;bromothiophenes to form electrophilic ArCF2Br compounds for in situ nucleophilic substitution, thereby avoiding &#945;&#8208;fluoride elimination pathways that typically plague &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions. This method streamlines the modular synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzyl(thio)ethers and led to the broader realization that halogen transfer to unstable carbanions is an enabling principle across diverse C(sp2)&#9472;H and C(sp3)&#9472;H systems.

         <title>Antibacterial Siderophores of Pandoraea Pathogens and Their Impact on the Diseased Lung Microbiota</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of environmental and pathogenic Pandoraea species identified a conserved NRPS gene cluster and led to the discovery of novel siderophores, pandorabactins, which exert their antibacterial activity by depleting iron from competitors. Bioinformatic analysis of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients coupled with bioassays indicates that pandorabactins outcompete other bacteria in sequestering iron and have an impact on the diseased lung microbiota.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria of the genus Pandoraea, frequently acquired from the environment, are an emerging cause of opportunistic respiratory infections, especially in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, their specialized metabolites, including niche and virulence factors, remained unknown. Through genome mining of environmental and clinical isolates of diverse Pandoraea species, we identified a highly conserved biosynthesis gene cluster (pan) that codes for a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembling a new siderophore. Using bioinformatics&#8208;guided metabolic profiling of wild type and a targeted null mutant, we discovered the corresponding metabolites, pandorabactin A and B. Their structures and chelate (gallium) complexes were elucidated by a combination of chemical degradation, derivatization, NMR, and MS analysis. Metagenomics and bioinformatics of sputum samples of CF patients indicated that the presence of the pan gene locus correlates with the prevalence of specific bacteria in the lung microbiome. Bioassays and mass spectrometry imaging showed that pandorabactins have antibacterial activities against various lung pathogens (Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas) through depleting iron in the competitors. Taken together, these findings offer first insight into niche factors of Pandoraea and indicate that pandorabactins shape the diseased lung microbiota through the competition for iron.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinolines To Form 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahdyroquinolines Using Water as the Hydrogen Atom Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of a sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is an attractive strategy for the stereoselective reduction of cyclic disubstituted &#960;&#8208;systems to access the thermodynamically more stable trans&#8208;isomer, which would be the minor compound considering a kinetically controlled cis&#8208;hydrogenation process. Herein, we demonstrate stereoselective photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated quinoline reductions with water as the hydrogen atom source under mild conditions to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with complete selectivity towards reduction of the heteroaromatic part. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and provides access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. These trans&#8208;isomers are not readily obtained using established methods, as transition&#8208;metal catalyzed regioselective quinoline hydrogenations provide the corresponding cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted isomers with high selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation of the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinolines proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis&#8208;selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline followed by a trans&#8208;selective photoisomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed luminescent property, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophore and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#215;10&#8208;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8208;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal. Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2(H2PO4)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25 K &#8208; 400 K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c ~ 22 MK&#8208;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b ~ &#8208;47 MK&#8208;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modelling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (~8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near-zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two-dimensional coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4-triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd-Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25 K - 400 K. Using multi-temperature high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine-rack-like framework of Cd-Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn-Tz and Mn-Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd-Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c ~ 22 MK-1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b ~ -47 MK-1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out-of-plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine-rack motifs. X-ray electron density analysis and modelling of low-temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd-triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (~8/12%) in the Cd-Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;acid Strategy for Corrosion&#8208;Free Proton Storage: Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte Engineering Toward Sustainable Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous proton batteries, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of protons such as minimal hydrated radius, natural abundance, and rapid transport kinetics, have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, conventional strong acid electrolytes like H2SO4 suffer from critical limitations including electrode dissolution and incompatibility with battery components. To circumvent these challenges, weak acids (e.g., HCOOH and H3PO4) have been strategically selected as alternative electrolytes due to their non&#8208;corrosive characteristics. Particularly, the implementation of a high&#8208;concentration "water&#8208;in&#8208;acid" (WIA) effectively suppresses undesirable interactions between electrode materials and free water molecules. Through electrolyte engineering, we developed a 9.5 M H3PO4 WIA system that synergizes with a molybdenum trioxide electrode, achieving remarkable electrochemical performance: a high reversible capacity of 229.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 A g&#8208;1 and exceptional cycling stability with 83.86% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1, surpassing conventional H2SO4&#8208;based systems by both capacity and cyclability. This innovative approach establishes a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance aqueous energy storage systems through acid&#8208;dominated electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>A Joyful Journey: Tungsten(VI) and Tungsten(V) Fluorides Meet&#160;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first complexation of tungsten(VI) fluoride with&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (cAACMe) is reported, which led to the complexes [(NHC)WF6] (NHC = IiPrMe,&#160;1; BIiPr,&#160;2; IMes,&#160;3; IDipp,&#160;4; and SIDipp,&#160;5) and [(cAACMe)WF&#8326;]&#160;6. Solid&#8208;state structural analysis reveals distorted mono&#8208;capped trigonal prismatic geometries for&#160;2&#160;and&#160;3, whereas&#160;6&#160;adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Reduction of&#160;1&#8211;6&#160;with 0.5 equivalents of TMS&#8208;pyMe&#8208;TMS afforded rare tungsten(V) fluoride complexes [(NHC)WF&#8325;] (NHC = IiPrMe,&#160;7; BIiPr,&#160;8; IMes,&#160;9; IDipp,&#160;10&#160;and SIDipp,&#160;11). Reduction of&#160;6&#160;with TMS&#8208;py&#8208;TMS yielded the dinuclear, fluoride&#8208;bridged complex [(cAACMe)WF&#8325;]&#8322;&#160;12. Subsequent addition of a second equivalent cAACMe&#160;to&#160;12&#160;gave the mononuclear&#160;bis&#8208;carbene complex [(cAACMe)&#8322;WF&#8325;]&#160;13. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectroscopy confirm a predominantly metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radical in both&#160;12&#160;and&#160;13.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer, and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalysts that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack, and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1 nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layer in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Data Guides the Discovery of Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Inhibitors Using DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadening the application of covalent inhibitors requires the exploration of nucleophilic residues beyond cysteine. The covalent DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (CoDEL) represents an advanced technology for covalent drug discovery. However, its application in lysine&#8208;targeting inhibitors remains uncharted territory. Here, we report the utilization of CoDEL selection guided by proteome&#8208;wide data to identify lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. A comprehensive assessment of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) data on lysine distribution and ligandability reveals potential targets for selective covalent inhibition, including phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), bromodomain (BRD) family proteins, and ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N). The 10.7&#8208;million&#8208;member CoDELs, featuring diverse lysine&#8208;reactive warheads, enables the discovery of a series of covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. In&#8208;depth characterization of binding sites and modes of action provides structural and functional insights. Notably, irreversible covalent inhibitors unveil a novel mechanism for regulating UBE2N&#8208;mediated ubiquitination by modulating the conformation of the protein complex. Our work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy, offering an efficient and versatile selection method for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting functional lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Disorders within Cathode Materials of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials has been increasing. The energy densities of cathode materials have been improved by adapting structural deviation from the ideal fully ordered &#945;&#8208;NaFeO2 type, but that led to limitations in terms of structural stability and safety. Although disorders in cathode materials are closely related to their electrochemical properties, unfortunately, characterizing the disorder itself in cathode materials has been challenging due to its complex parasitic reaction and strong correlation with other disorders occurring during charge/discharge. In this review, we categorize various disorders by their scales of ordering from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range. We addressed the principles of various characterization tools to figure out how they can help to identify the structural disorder in cathode materials. Specifically, we focused on the underlying principles of each characterization technique to correlate different disorder&#8208;driven phenomena through several case studies. It underscores the substantial importance of disorder&#8208;property relationships and the corresponding characterization methods, which can provide novel research strategies for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials with decent structural stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Locked Peptide&#8208;DNA Nanostructures for CRISPR&#8208;Amplified Activity&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a new class of chemical probes for activity&#8208;based sensing of proteases, termed Cleavable, Locked Initiator Probes (CLIPs). CLIPs contain a protease&#8208;cleavable peptide linked between two programmable DNA strands &#8211; an &#8220;initiator&#8221; DNA and a shorter &#8220;blocking&#8221; DNA. These DNA sequences are designed to hybridize, creating a &#8220;locked&#8221; hairpin&#8208;like structure. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the initiator strand is released, triggering the activation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a enzymes and producing an amplified fluorescence response. CLIPs generate more than 20&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals at room temperature (25&#176;C), significantly outperforming commercial probes by yielding ~40&#8208;fold lower limits of detection (LOD) at 100&#8208;fold lower concentrations. Their versatility enables the detection of various disease&#8208;relevant proteases &#8211; including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, caspase&#8208;3, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;7, and cathepsin B &#8211; simply by altering the peptide sequence. Importantly, CLIPs detect cathepsin B in four different colorectal cancer cell lines, highlighting their clinical potential. Taken together, the sensitivity (LOD: ~88 pM), selectivity, and rapid assay time (down to 35 minutes), combined with the ability to operate in complex biological media with minimal sample preparation, position CLIPs as powerful chemical tools for activity&#8208;based sensing of functional enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Geometry&#8208;Property Relationship of Benzodipyrrole&#8208;Based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining photovoltaic&#160;properties of organic semiconductor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we used dichlorine&#8208;substituted benzene as the A&#8217; unit in A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) and synthesized&#160;four isomers of the benzodipyrrole&#8208;based SMAs (C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, &#577;&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, M&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl) with C, &#577;, M, and S molecular geometries, and the effect of the molecular geometry on their photovoltaic performance was studied. We revealed that the molecular geometry influences the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in three aspects: (1) intrinsic physicochemical properties, including energy levels, absorption and reorganization energy; (2) molecular stacking pattern, which govern the exciton diffusion and charge transport process; and (3) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction and miscibility. We found that the C&#8208;shaped molecular geometry possesses suitable energy level and absorption range, dense and ordered molecular stacking, and improved donor&#8208;acceptor interactions and miscibility. These advantages enable a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the binary OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl active layer. The other shaped SMAs showed weaknesses in different aspects, such as limited absorption of &#577;&#8208;shaped SMA, large reorganization energies and loose molecular stacking of M&#8208;shaped SMA, low solubility and strong aggregation of S&#8208;shaped SMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer to increase electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raise energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduce bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). CNDTs tend to distribute over donor/acceptor interfaces and disturb molecular stacking of Y6 to deliver more disordered donor/acceptor interfaces but higher crystal quality in the D18:Y6+ blend film, compared to D18:Y6. Altogether, in the D18:Y6+ blend film, a higher energy of charge transfer state magnifies energy barrier for charge recombination to decrease charge recombination rate/ratio and reduce krec, inhibiting bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far. PCE increases subsequently to 19.80%. It demonstrates that increasing interface disorder without sacrificing crystal quality enhances energy barrier of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Highly Reversible Four&#8208;electron Redox of S/Cu2S for Aqueous Zn/S&#8208;Cu Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of sulfur (S) cathode with Cu2+/Cu+ redox carriers has been considered as a promising cathode for the next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage device due to the high specific capacity (two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion), intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory cycling stability of Sulfur&#8208;Copper (S&#8208;Cu) cathode hinders its practical application. Herein, the two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversions are firstly decoupled in our study, identifying the inferior conversion reversibility between the charging intermedia CuS and the final product S as the primary cause for deteriorate cycling capability. Concerning the different hydrated dimensions of the Cu(H2O)62+ and Cu(H2O)2+, the strategy of "spatial confinement" is proposed to alter the oxidation path of Cu2S and prevent the formation of the intermedia CuS. To ensure the efficient S incorporation into the spatially confined carbon matrix, chalcogen element selenium (Se) is employed to "cut" the S8 into short&#8208;chain molecules. Consequently, the well&#8208;designed S&#8208;Cu cathode achieves one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron reaction and exhibits superior electrochemical stability with an average capacity attenuation of 0.034% during 700 cycles. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the conversion mechanism for the S&#8208;Cu cathode within the spatial&#8208;confinement environment, and renders valuable insights for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type cathodes in aqueous energy&#8208;storage device.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Iron(III) Catalysis for Late&#8208;Stage C&#8211;H Fluoroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective functionalization of complex molecules poses a fundamental challenge. In this regard, the synergetic combination of photoexcitation with electron transfer by anodic oxidation bears unique potential for novel reaction manifolds that go beyond individual photo&#8208; or electrochemistry.[1&#8208;3] Herein, we introduce a resource&#8208;economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth&#8208;abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H fluoroalkylations of bio&#8208;relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides. Mechanistic studies supported a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer&#8208;induced formation of the fluoroalkyl radical.</dc:description>

In this regard, the synergetic combination of photoexcitation with electron transfer by anodic oxidation bears unique potential for novel reaction manifolds that go beyond individual photo- or electrochemistry.[1-3] Herein, we introduce a resource-economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth-abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late-stage C&#8211;H fluoroalkylations of bio-relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides. Mechanistic studies supported a ligand-to-metal charge transfer-induced formation of the fluoroalkyl radical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 gene editing represents an effective and precise technology to induce mutations in the genome, and it has been applied to a wide range of organisms for diverse purposes. However, CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing in spiders has not been reported to date. In this study, we demonstrate CRISPR&#8208;mediated microinjection in parental spiders leading to both knock&#8208;out (KO) and knock&#8208;in (KI) mutations within the spider&#8217;s offspring. The KO of the gene sine oculis causes total eye loss, confirming the role of the gene in the development of all spider eyes. The knock&#8208;in of a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP&#8208;KI) within a spider silk gene encoding one compound of the major ampullate silk of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum yields red fluorescent silk fibers. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of functionalizing silk proteins in spiders using CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing without influencing silk assembly. Our study expands the application of CRISPR to spiders and provides insights in the fields of developmental genetics as well as material sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Silyl Groups Enhance Hydrolytic Stability and Photocleavage Efficiency in Carbamates for Protein Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocleavable molecules are valuable tools for biological studies, enabling spatiotemporal activation of molecular functions within cellular environments. In particular, coumarin&#8208;based photolytic molecules are useful because of their ability to flexibly tune the wavelength of photostimulation through their structural modifications. Ideal photocleavable molecular tools require hydrolytic stability and selective susceptibility to photo stimuli. However conventional coumarin&#8208;based molecules have not simultaneously achieved both highly efficient photocleavage and hydrolysis resistance. Herein, we proposed a novel molecular design concept that introduces a silyl group into coumarin&#8208;based molecules at a position remote from the photolabile bond, creating an ideal photocleavable molecule for chemical biology tools. The established orbital effect of the remotely introduced silyl group improves the photolysis efficiency of coumarin&#8208;based molecules, while its bulkiness substantially enhances their hydrolytic stability in aqueous environments and under enzymatic conditions. Furthermore, this improvement in molecular functionality contributes to the development of high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;release biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated and Paired Metal Sites in Zeolites using Solid&#8208;State Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolated and paired extraframework transition metal cations in zeolites are emerging as top candidates for numerous applications not limited to selective methane oxidation to methanol, selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, propane dehydrogenation, propylene epoxidation, and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Importantly, these well&#8208;defined heterogeneous catalysts offer parallels with molecular and metalloenzyme catalytic active sites. Aqueous&#8208;phase ion exchange (APIE) is the most common synthesis technique to obtain these catalysts. Solid&#8208;state ion exchange (SSIE) is an often&#8208;overlooked technique that offers synthetic advantages compared to APIE. Thus, recent advances in solid&#8208;state synthesis strategies merit contemporary contextualization. In this minireview we describe the basic principles, methods, mechanisms, challenges, and advances in&#160;solid&#8208;state ion exchange in the context of&#160;well&#8208;defined transition metal cation&#160;active sites located in extraframework positions of the zeolite.</dc:description>

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comparing to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates have, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183; [SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4 (tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3 (Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M=Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X=Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity which is dependent on their different electronic structures.</dc:description>
