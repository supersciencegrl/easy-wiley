         <title>Unusual Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity in Oxidation of Pyrroles and Indoles Enabled by a Thianthrenium Salt Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dearomative oxidation of pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones is described, which employs a sulfoxide as oxidant, in conjunction with a carboxylic acid anhydride and a Br&#248;nsted acid additive. 3&#8208;Substituted pyrroles undergo regioselective oxidation to give the product isomer in which oxygen has been introduced at the more sterically hindered position. This counterintuitive regioselectivity is rationalized by a proposed mechanism that proceeds by initial thianthrenium introduction at the less&#8208;hindered pyrrole &#945;&#8208;position, followed by distal attack of an oxygen nucleophile and subsequent elimination of thianthrene. Furthermore, the same reaction conditions are also able to effect a chemoselective oxidation of indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and additionally of indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones to 2&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. Here again, the observed regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities are rationalized through the intermediacy of a thianthrenium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Highly Sensitive Active Site in Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Enhanced Ethanol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a desirable ethanol dehydrogenation process necessitates a highly efficient and selective catalyst with low cost. Herein, we show that the &#8220;complex active site&#8221; consisting of atomically dispersed Au atoms with the neighboring oxygen vacancies (Vo) and undercoordinated cation on oxide supports can be prepared and display unique catalytic properties for ethanol dehydrogenation. The &#8220;complex active site&#8221; Au&#8208;Vo&#8208;Zr3+ on Au1/ZrO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate, with above 37,964 mol H2 per mol Au per hour (385 g H2 g&#8208;1 Au h&#8208;1) at 350 oC, which is 3.32, 2.94 and 15 times higher than Au1/CeO2, Au1/TiO2, and Au1/Al2O3, respectively. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate the structural sensitivity of these complex sites by assessing their selectivity and activity in ethanol dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the design and development of cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. Fundamentally, atomic&#8208;level catalyst design by colocalizing catalytically active metal atoms forming a structure&#8208;sensitive &#8220;complex site&#8221;, is a crucial way to advance from heterogeneous catalysis to molecular catalysis.&#160;Our study advanced the understanding of the structure sensitivity of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Metallosupramolecular Glycoassemblies for Enhancing Lectin Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalency is a fundamental principle in nature that leads to high&#8208;affinity intermolecular recognition through multiple cooperative interactions that overcome the weak binding of individual constituents. For example, multivalency plays a critical role in lectin&#8208;carbohydrate interactions that participate in many essential biological processes. Designing high&#8208;affinity multivalent glycoconjugates that engage lectins results in systems with the potential to disrupt these biological processes, offering promising applications in therapeutic design and bioengineering. Here, a versatile and tunable synthetic platform for the synthesis of metallosupramolecular glycoassemblies is presented that leverages subcomponent self&#8208;assembly, which employs metal ion templates to generate complex supramolecular architectures from simple precursors in one pot. Through ligand design, this approach provides precise control over molecular parameters such as size, shape, flexibility, valency, and charge, which afforded a diverse family of well&#8208;defined hybrid glyconanoassemblies. Evaluation of these complexes as multivalent binders to Concanavalin A (Con A) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) demonstrates the optimal saccharide tether length and the effect of electrostatics on protein affinity, revealing insights into the impact of synthetic design on molecular recognition. The presented studies offer an enhanced understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships governing lectin&#8208;saccharide interactions at the molecular level and guide a systematic approach towards optimizing glyconanoassembly binding parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Miniaturized Electrochemical Sensing Platforms for Quantitative Monitoring of Glutamate Dynamics in the Central Nervous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters within the mammalian central nervous system. The role of glutamate in regulating neural network signaling transmission through both synaptic and extra&#8208;synaptic paths highlights the importance of the real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of its concentration and dynamics in living organisms. Progresses in multidisciplinary research have promoted the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, electronic devices, and integrated systems. This review summarizes recent works reporting various electrochemical sensor designs and their applicability as miniaturized neural probes to in vivo sensing within biological environments. We start with an overview of the role and physiological significance of glutamate, the metabolic routes, and its presence in various bodily fluids. Next, we discuss the design principles, commonly employed validation models/protocols, and successful demonstrations of multifunctional, compact, and bio&#8208;integrated devices in animal models. The final section provides an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Benzoxazine&#8208;linked One&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Using the Mannich Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent polymerization of organic molecules into crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polymers is effective for achieving desired thermal, optical, and electrical properties, yet it remains a persistent synthetic challenge for their inherent tendency to adopt amorphous or semicrystalline phases. Here we report a strategy to synthesize crystaline 1D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composing quasi&#8208;conjugated chains with benzoxazine linkages via the one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. Through [4+2] and [2+2] type Mannich condensation reactions, we fabricated stoichiometric and sub&#8208;stoichiometric 1D covalent polymeric chains, respectively, using doubly and singly&#8208;linked benzoxazine ring. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalizations of them with a chiral MacMillan catalyst produce crystaline organic photocatalysts that demonstrated excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in light&#8208;driven asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes, affording up to 94% enantiomeric excess</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13
C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10 cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Water Surface Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Cationic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Films as the Anion&#8208;Selective Electrode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs (V&#8208;C2DPs) are synthesized on the water surface via Knoevenagel reaction, presenting as fully crystalline and highly oriented thin films. The obtained V&#8208;C2DPs exhibit well&#8208;defined cationic sites and 1D channels, facilitating the anion&#8208;selective transport. The integration of V&#8208;C2DPs as graphite cathode coatings into zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs) enables to improve its specific capacity and cycling life.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional polymers (V&#8208;2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D COFs) featuring high in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and robust frameworks have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;related applications. However, current synthetic approaches are restricted to producing V&#8208;2D COF powders that lack processability, impeding their integration into devices, particularly within membrane technologies reliant upon thin films. Herein, we report the novel on&#8208;water surface synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs films (V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 and V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;2) via Knoevenagel polycondensation, which serve as the anion&#8208;selective electrode coating for highly&#8208;reversible and durable zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs). Model reactions and theoretical modeling revealed the enhanced reactivity and reversibility of the Knoevenagel reaction on the water surface. On this basis, we demonstrated the on&#8208;water surface 2D polycondensation towards V&#8208;C2DPs films that show large lateral size, tunable thickness, and high chemical stability. Representatively, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 presents as a fully crystalline and face&#8208;on oriented film with in&#8208;plane lattice parameters of a=b&#8776;43.3&#8197;&#197;. Profiting from its well&#8208;defined cationic sites, oriented 1D channels, and stable frameworks, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 film possesses superior bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;)&#8208;transport selectivity (transference, t_=0.85) for graphite cathode in high&#8208;voltage ZDIBs, thus triggering additional TFSI&#8722;&#8208;intercalation stage and promoting its specific capacity (from ~83 to 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and cycling life (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles, 95&#8201;% capacity retention).

         <title>Design of 3D&#8208;Printed Heterogeneous Reactor Systems To Overcome Incompatibility Hurdles when Combining Metal and Enzyme Catalysis in a One&#8208;Pot Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction in one reactor in spite of the use of incompatible catalysts is demonstrated. The chemoenzymatic process is based on embedding enzyme&#8208;deactivating Cu ions in a 3D&#8208;printed ceramic scaffold, which then &#8220;shields&#8221; the enzyme from the critical Cu component. By such compartmentalization, the desired product was obtained with 80&#8201;% overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Combining chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis enables the design of novel economic and sustainable one&#8208;pot processes for the preparation of industrial chemicals, preferably proceeding in water. While a range of proofs&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the compatibility of such catalysts from these two different &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; have recently been demonstrated, merging noncompatible chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts for joint applications within one reactor remained a challenge. A conceptual solution is compartmentalization of the catalytic moieties by heterogenization of critical catalyst components, thus &#8220;shielding&#8221; them from the complementary noncompatible catalyst, substrate or reagent. Exemplified for a one&#8208;pot process consisting of a metal&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction as noncompatible individual reactions steps, we demonstrate that making use of 3D printing of heterogeneous materials containing Cu as a critical metal component can overcome such incompatibility hurdles. The application of a 3D&#8208;printed Cu&#8208;ceramic device as metal catalyst component allows an efficient combination with the enzyme and the desired two&#8208;step transformation of styrene into the chiral alcohol product with high overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity. This compartmentalization concept based on 3D printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.

         <title>Deciphering Anion&#8208;Modulated Solvation Structure for Calcium Intercalation into Graphite for Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The electrostatic interactions between Ca ions and anions can regulate the solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion configurations in the dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes, which govern the Ca ion storage capacities and reaction kinetics for graphite anodes in Ca ion batteries.







Abstract
Co&#8208;intercalation reactions make graphite a feasible anode in Ca ion batteries, yet the correlation between Ca ion intercalation behaviors and electrolyte structure remains unclear. This study, for the first time, elucidates the pivotal role of anions in modulating the Ca ion solvation structures and their subsequent intercalation into graphite. Specifically, the electrostatic interactions between Ca ion and anions govern the configurations of solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion in dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes and graphite intercalation compounds. Among the anions considered (BH4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, TFSI&#8722; and [B(hfip)4]&#8722;), the coordination of four solvent molecules per Ca ion (CN=4) leads to the highest reversible capacities and the fastest reaction kinetics in graphite. Our study illuminates the origins of the distinct Ca ion intercalation behaviors across various anion&#8208;modulated electrolytes, employing a blend of experimental and theoretical approaches. Importantly, the practical viability of graphite anodes in Ca&#8208;ion full cells is confirmed, showing significant promise for advanced energy storage systems.

By combining DC voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy, the operando mechanism of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) conducted on a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode was decoded through data co&#8208;fitting. The reaction rates of three elementary steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer) over a practical potential range were thus distilled individually, revealing that the Volmer step had never been a rate determining step as presumed in previous reports.







Abstract
Being an efficient approach to the utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of particular significance in the current carbon&#8208;neutrality time. Yet the mechanistic picture of the HOR is still blurred, mostly because the elemental steps of this reaction are rapid and highly entangled, especially when deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here we report a strategy for decoding the HOR mechanism under operando conditions. In addition to the wide&#8208;potential&#8208;range I&#8211;V curves obtained using gas diffusion electrodes, we have applied the AC impedance spectroscopy to provide independent and complementary kinetic information. Combining multidimensional data sources has enabled us to fit, in mathematical rigor, the core kinetic parameter set in a 5&#8208;D data space. The reaction rate of the three elemental steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer reactions), as a function of the overpotential, can thus be distilled individually. Such an undocumented kinetic picture unravels, in detail, how the HOR is controlled by the elemental steps on polarization. For instance, at low polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction is relatively slow and can be ignored; but at high polarization region, the Heyrovsky reaction will surpass the Tafel reaction. Additionally, the Volmer reaction has been the fastest within overpotentials of interest. Our findings not only offer a better understanding of the HOR mechanism, but also lay the foundation for the development of improved hydrogen energy utilization systems.

         <title>Magnetic Silica&#8208;Coated Fluorescent Microspheres (MagSiGlow) for Simultaneous Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid multiplexed, on&#8208;bead immune assay using highly fluorescent magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) loaded in microarrays to achieve simultaneous detection and co&#8208;localization of 7500 microspheres per image. We demonstrate remarkable sensitivity and an over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over in the simultaneous detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers.







Abstract
Multiplexed bead assays for solution&#8208;phase biosensing often encounter cross&#8208;over reactions during signal amplification steps, leading to unwanted false positive and high background signals. Current solutions involve complex custom&#8208;designed and costly equipment, limiting their application in simple laboratory setup. In this study, we introduce a straightforward protocol to adapt a multiplexed single&#8208;bead assay to standard fluorescence imaging plates, enabling the simultaneous analysis of thousands of reactions per plate. This approach focuses on the design and synthesis of bright fluorescent and magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) with multiple fluorescent wavelengths serving as unique detection markers. The imaging&#8208;based, single&#8208;bead assay, combined with a scripted algorithm, allows the detection, segmentation, and co&#8208;localization on average of 7500 microspheres per field of view across five imaging channels in less than one second. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with remarkable sensitivity at low protein detection limits (100&#8197;pg/mL). This technique showed over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over to the solution&#8208;based method after the concurrent detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers. This approach holds the promise of substantially enhancing high throughput biosensing for multiple targets, seamlessly integrating with rapid image analysis algorithms.

High&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy have been developed by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are in high demand for powering applications in extreme environments. Here, we have developed high&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The lamellae have been aligned parallel to the surface in the dielectric films. This structural arrangement resembles the horizontal alignment of nanosheet fillers in polymer nanocomposites and nanosheet&#8208;like lamellae in block copolymers, which has been proven to provide the optimal topological structure for electrical energy storage. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films. This novel approach of enhancing the capacitive energy storage properties by controlled orientation of lamellae in homopolymer offers a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Platinum&#8208;Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propane dehydrogenation over Pt nanoparticles is an essential industrial reaction to produce propylene. However, the structures that form under reaction conditions have remained elusive. Using operando transmission electron microscopy (OTEM) we found that in situ generated ordered Pt&#8722;C solid solutions are responsible for heightened selectivity. Its impact on propane dehydrogenation is discussed.







Abstract
The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining operando transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8722;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride&#8208;type Pt&#8722;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.

         <title>Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>

This study demonstrates the effects of halogenation on the mechanical and photomechanical behavior of organic crystals. Starting with (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, the brittle photoinert crystals evolve into mechanically flexible, photochemically reactive crystals via double and quadruple halogenation, an approach that advocates for combined chemical and crystal engineering strategies to determine the key factors determining the solid&#8208;state response dynamics.







Abstract
Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations by intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In the absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are not only elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.

         <title>Operando Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined operando XAS and electrochemical characterizations unravel a divergent structural optimization of cobalt sulfide catalysts toward overall water splitting in different media. Our results highlight the crucial influence of in situ formed active species on the catalytic performance, and we show that these transient coordination environments are not evident from ex situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8211;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8722;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8722;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8722;Co&#8722;Co&#8722;S moieties as the true catalytically active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8722;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8722;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.

         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;Long ORR Durability&#8212;Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the interatomic interactions between the constituent atoms of the catalyst, a novel approach has been introduced to prevent the dissolution of transition metals, resulting in ultra&#8208;long durability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalysts demonstrate high activity and excellent durability with low platinum group metal (PGM) loading.







Abstract
The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92&#8201;% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000&#8197;cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200&#8197;mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.

         <title>Controllable Skeletal and Peripheral Editing of Pyrroles with Vinylcarbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly controllable molecular editing strategy of pyrroles was achieved by using trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as vinylcarbene precursors, which led to the first dearomative single&#8208;atom skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion, as well as three types of peripheral editing reactions: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
The skeletal editing of azaarenes through insertion, deletion, or swapping of single atoms has recently gained considerable momentum in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe a practical skeletal editing strategy using vinylcarbenes in situ generated from trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones, leading to the first dearomative skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion. Furthermore, depending on the used catalyst and substrate, three types of peripheral editing reactions of pyrroles are also disclosed: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition. These controllable molecular editing reactions provide a powerful platform for accessing medicinally relevant CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks, such as 2,5&#8208;dihydropyridines, piperidines, azabicyclo[3.3.0]octadienes, and allylated pyrroles from readily available pyrroles. Mechanistic insights from experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the origin of substrate&#8208; or catalyst&#8208;controlled chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the reaction mechanism.

We report a novel chemoselective dehydrogenative functionalization of cyclopropylamides enabled by cooperative photoredox and cobalt catalysis for forging the allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal scaffolds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and atom&#8208;economic fashion.

Abstract
We disclose herein a novel photoredox and cobalt co&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening/acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. This sustainable and atom&#8208;economic approach allows the rapid assembly of a wide range of allylic N,O&#8208;acyl&#8208;acetal derivatives. The starting materials are readily available and the reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group compatibility. The optimized conditions accommodate assorted cycloalkylamides and primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, with applications in late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, stimulating further utility in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, selective nucleophilic substitutions with various carbon nucleophiles were achieved in a one&#8208;pot fashion, offering a reliable avenue to access some cyclic and acyclic derivatives.

         <title>Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8722;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a strategy to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding via the doping engineering, which minimizes the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling, thereby achieving excellent performance in urea electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8220;green synthetic strategy&#8221; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo0.39Ru0.61O3&#8722;&#948; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and faradic efficiency of 34.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) in the SrRuO3. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH2 intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8722;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8722;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by&#8208;products.

     alt="Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8722;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a strategy to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding via the doping engineering, which minimizes the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling, thereby achieving excellent performance in urea electrosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8220;green synthetic strategy&#8221; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo&lt;sub&gt;0.39&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.61&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and faradic efficiency of 34.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) in the SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8722;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8722;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by-products. This work presents an insight into molecular coupling reactions towards urea synthesis via the doping engineering on SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 2D Acridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Selective Detection and Efficient Extraction of Gold from Complex Aqueous&#8208;Based Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) was prepared for the selective detection and efficient capture of gold. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the a&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer, selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0) are the possible sensing and adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh capture efficiency (&gt;96&#8201;%) for gold in real water environments including river water, seawater and CPU leaching solutions.







Abstract
Developing candidate materials which possess the ability of both selective detection and efficient capture of precious metal gold is highly desirable for environment and economy. However, most of reported materials only focus on single function, which seriously restricts their practical application as probes or adsorbents. Herein, a two dimensional (2D) acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) is prepared via the linkage of imine bonds for gold detection and adsorption. The synthesized COF can achieve both fluorescence and colorimetric dual sensing for Au3+ in a low concentration range (0.1&#8211;1.5&#8197;ppm) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.036&#8197;ppm. Impressively, the selectivity of TpDa&#8208;COF for the detection of Au3+ is admirable (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+ for negligible influence on its fluorescence). In addition, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 982.5&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for gold at pH=4, which is attributed the synergistic effect of both selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0). Meanwhile, both positive entropy change (&#916;S=76.07&#8197;J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and high distribution coefficient (Kd=12484.8&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) confirm the good affinity between TpDa&#8208;COF framework and gold. This work gives us a new insight to prepare COF with pyridine nitrogen sites for gold detection and adsorption.

         <title>Heteroatom Substitution Strategy Modulates Thermodynamics Towards Chemically Recyclable Polyesters and Monomeric Unit Sequence by Temperature Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new monomer design strategy in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system, coined as heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS), is proposed for a) the synthesis of chemically recyclable polyesters, and b) the sequence control in copolyesters by temperature switching.







Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS) in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system to modulate thermodynamics toward chemically recyclable polyesters. Three VL&#8208;based monomers containing different heteroatoms (M1 (N), M2 (S), and M3 (O)), instead of C&#8208;5 carbon, were designed and synthesized to verify our proposed HSS. All three monomers undergo organocatalytic living/controlled ROP and controllable depolymerization. Impressively, the resulting P(M1) achieved over 99&#8201;% monomer recovery under both mild solution depolymerization and high vacuum pyrolysis conditions without any side reactions, and the recycled monomers can be polymerized again forming new polymers. The systematic study of the relationship between heteroatom substitution and recyclability shows that introducing heteroatoms does change the thermodynamics of the monomers (&#916;Hpo, &#916;Spo and Tc values), thereby adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. DFT calculations found that the introduction of heteroatoms adjusts the ring strain by changing the angular strain of the monomers, and the order of their angular strain (M2&gt;M1&gt;M3) is consistent with the order of the experimentally obtained enthalpy change. Notably, the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step copolymerization of two of each of the three monomers enables the synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled copolymers from gradient to random to block structures, by simply switching the copolymerization temperature.

A hierarchical assembly strategy for fabricating &#8220;2.5D&#8221; (2.5 dimensional) DNA origami crystals with customizable layer properties and achieve various 2.5D assemblies with different layer numbers, interlayer distances and surface morphologies.







Abstract
The finite periodic arrangement of functional nanomaterials on the two&#8208;dimensional scale enables the integration and enhancement of individual properties, making them an important research topic in the field of tuneable nanodevices. Although layer&#8208;controllable lattices such as graphene have been successfully synthesized, achieving similar control over colloidal nanoparticles remains a challenge. DNA origami technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in programmed nanoparticle assembly. Based on this technology, we proposed a hierarchical assembly strategy to construct a universal DNA origami platform with customized layer properties, which we called 2.5&#8208;dimensional (2.5D) DNA origami crystals. Methodologically, this strategy divides the assembly procedure into two steps: 1) array synthesis, and 2) lattice synthesis, which means that the layer properties, including layer number, interlayer distance, and surface morphology, can be flexibly customized based on the independent designs in each step. In practice, these synthesized 2.5D crystals not only pioneer the expansion of the DNA origami crystal library to a wider range of dimensions, but also highlight the technological potential for templating 2.5D colloidal nanomaterial lattices.

         <title>An Expanded Palette of Fluorescent COS/H2S&#8208;Releasing Donors for H2S Delivery, Detection, and In Vivo Application</title>

We report a palette of fluorescent turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that are based on a sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Reaction with thiols generates H2S and a fluorescent response that can be monitored in situ, in live cells, and in live rats.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H2S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H2S donors have been developed to deliver H2S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H2S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H2S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol&#8208;activated fluorescence turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared&#8208;emitting dyes functionalized with an H2S&#8208;releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response (3&#8211;310&#8208;fold) and high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;60&#8201;%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H2S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H2S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H2S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H2S release from a fluorogenic donor in non&#8208;transparent organisms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donors have been developed to deliver H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol-activated fluorescence turn-on COS/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared-emitting dyes functionalized with an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn-on response (3&#8211;310-fold) and high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release efficiencies (&amp;gt;60&#8201;%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release from a fluorogenic donor in non-transparent organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stapled Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the Binding Interface of N6&#8208;Adenosine&#8208;Methyltransferase Subunits METTL3 and METTL14 for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a stapled peptide inhibitor, RSM3, of the N6&#8208;adenosine&#8208;methyltransferase subunit METTL3, discovered from the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 structure. This inhibitor induces METTL3 degradation and suppresses m6A mRNA methylation, differently from the mechanism of small molecule STM2457. RSM3 exhibits remarkable anticancer efficacy in a PC3 prostate cancer cell line xenograft tumor model, highlighting the potential of drug design targeting METTL3.







Abstract
METTL3, a primary methyltransferase catalyzing the RNA N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been identified as an oncogene in several cancer types and thus nominated as a potentially effective target for therapeutic inhibition. However, current options using this strategy are limited. In this study, we targeted protein&#8211;protein interactions at the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 binding interface to inhibit complex formation and subsequent catalysis of the RNA m6A modification. Among candidate peptides, RM3 exhibited the highest anti&#8208;cancer potency, inhibiting METTL3 activity while also facilitating its proteasomal degradation. We then designed a stapled peptide inhibitor (RSM3) with enhanced peptide stability and formation of the &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure required for METTL3 interaction. Functional and transcriptomic analysis in vivo indicated that RSM3 induced upregulation of programmed cell death&#8208;related genes while inhibiting cancer&#8208;promoting signals. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly suppressed while apoptosis was enhanced upon RSM3 treatment, accompanied by increased METTL3 degradation, and reduced global RNA methylation levels in two in vivo tumor models. This peptide inhibitor thus exploits a mechanism distinct from other small&#8208;molecule competitive inhibitors to inhibit oncogenic METTL3 activity. Our findings collectively highlight the potential of targeting METTL3 in cancer therapies through peptide&#8208;based inhibition of complex formation and proteolytic degradation.

         <title>Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers by Dynamic Covalent Boroxine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronic acid self&#8208;condensation provides ready access to boroxine&#8208;based, C3&#8208;symmetrical monomer architectures that can cooperatively assemble into helical supramolecular polymers. The dynamic boroxine scaffold enables fast intermolecular exchange of boronic acid between different monomers and facilitates the introduction of functionality into assembled structures by co&#8208;condensation with functional boronic acids.







Abstract
Molecular scaffolds that enable the combinatorial synthesis of new supramolecular building blocks are promising targets for the construction of functional molecular systems. Here, we report a supramolecular scaffold based on boroxine that enables the formation of chiral and ordered 1D supramolecular polymers, which can be easily functionalized for circularly polarized luminescence. The boroxine monomers are quantitatively synthesized in situ, both in bulk and in solution, from boronic acid precursors and cooperatively polymerize into 1D helical aggregates stabilized by threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. We then demonstrate amplification of asymmetry in the co&#8208;assembly of chiral/achiral monomers and the co&#8208;condensation of chiral/achiral precursors in classical and in situ sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers experiments, respectively, showing fast boronic acid exchange reactions occurring in the system. Remarkably, co&#8208;condensation of pyrene boronic acid with a hydrogen&#8208;bonding chiral boronic acid results in chiral pyrene aggregation with circularly polarized excimer emission and g&#8208;values in the order of 10&#8722;3. Yet, the electron deficiency of boron in boroxine makes them chemically addressable by nucleophiles, but also sensitive to hydrolysis. With this sensitivity in mind, we provide first insights into the prospects offered by boroxine&#8208;based supramolecular polymers to make chemically addressable, functional, and adaptive systems.

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Pulsed Electroreduction for Boosting the Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. We developed a stable CuSiOx catalyst with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites toward urea electrosynthesis, in which Cu species are uniformly dispersed in the silica matrix. Besides, we adopt pulsed electroreduction to overcome electrostatic interaction, promoting nitrate adsorption and reduction to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea industry protocol. Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system is not easily achievable. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via pulsed electroreduction. We found that the reconstruction&#8208;resistant CuSiOx nanotube, with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites, exhibits ultrastability in the electrosynthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2. Under a pulsed potential approach with optimal operating conditions, the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfaces achieve a superior urea production rate (1606.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1) with high selectivity (79.01&#8201;%) and stability (the Faradaic efficiency is retained at 80&#8201;% even after 80&#8197;h of testing), outperforming most reported electrocatalytic synthesis urea catalysts. We believe our strategy will incite further investigation into pulsed electroreduction increasing substrate transport, which may guide the design of ambient urea electrosynthesis and other energy conversion systems.

         <title>Imidazole&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Hydroxide Enabling the Li+ Desolvation/Diffusion Reaction and Flame Retardant Catalytic Dynamics for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of intercalated small organic molecules in the anode material was proposed to enhance the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The introduction of imidazole molecules provides more binding sites for lithium ions, which also can participate in the generation of SEI and maintain the stability of cobalt hydroxide structure. Moreover, the anode material has the function of smoke suppression and toxicity reduction when thermal runaway occurs, which can improve the thermal safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have found extensive applications due to their high energy density and low self&#8208;discharge rates, spanning from compact consumer electronics to large&#8208;scale energy storage facilities. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as inherent capacity degradation and the potential for thermal runaway hinder sustainable development. In this study, we introduce a unique approach to synthesize anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, specifically imidazole&#8208;intercalated cobalt hydroxide. This innovative material significantly enhances the Li+ desolvation/diffusion reaction and flame&#8208;retardant dynamics through complexing and catalytic synergetic effects. The lithium&#8208;ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)2 (MI&#8722;Co(OH)2) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO2. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high&#8208;performance and safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

The lithium-ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500&#8197;cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MI&#8722;Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high-performance and safe lithium-ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization to Prepare Recylable Micro&#8208;Adjuvants for Dendritic Cell Vaccine</title>

This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of P(MAG&#8208;co&#8208;DMC) based micro&#8208;adjuvants. The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation.







Abstract
In the development of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, the maturation of DCs is a critical stage. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in the maturation of DCs, with a major concern being to ensure both efficacy and safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of micro&#8208;adjuvants grafted with copolymers of 2&#8208;(methacrylamido) glucopyranose (MAG) and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC). The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. These micrometer&#8208;sized adjuvants surpass the optimal size range for cellular endocytosis, enabling the retrieval and reuse of them during the ex vivo maturation process, mitigating potential toxicity concerns associated with the endocytosis of non&#8208;metabolized nanoparticles. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation. This effect is influenced by the shape of the particle, as evidenced by the distinct promotion effects of rod&#8208;like and spherical micro&#8208;adjuvants with comparable sizes. Furthermore, the porous structure of the adjuvants enables them to function as cargo&#8208;carrying &#8220;micro&#8208;shuttles&#8221;, releasing antigens upon binding to DCs to facilitate efficient antigen delivery.

         <title>Unlocking the Metalation Applications of TMP&#8208;powered Fe and Co(II) bis(amides): Synthesis, Structure and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversing the more usual trend of replicating transition metal chemistry with main group compounds, this work elaborates the applications of the new earth&#8208;abundant d&#8208;block amides Fe(TMP)2 and Co(TMP)2 in deprotonative metalation chemistry, a field dominated by highly polar s&#8208;block amides such as LiTMP and NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide).







Abstract
Typified by LiTMP and TMPMgCl.LiCl, (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), s&#8208;block metal amides have found widespread applications in arene deprotonative metalation. On the contrary, transition metal amides lack sufficient basicity to activate these substrates. Breaking new ground in this field, here we present the synthesis and full characterisation of earth&#8208;abundant transition metals M(TMP)2 (M=Fe, Co). Uncovering a new reactivity profile towards fluoroarenes, these amide complexes can promote direct M&#8722;H exchange processes regioselectively using one or two of their basic amide arms. Remarkably, even when using a perfluorinated substrate, selective C&#8208;H metalation occurs leaving C&#8722;F bonds intact. Their kinetic basicity can be boosted by LiCl or NBu4Cl additives which enables formation of kinetically activated ate species. Combining spectroscopic and structural studies with DFT calculations, mechanistic insights have been gained on how these low polarity metalation processes take place. M(TMP)2 can also be used to access ferrocene and cobaltocene by direct deprotonation of cyclopentadiene and undergo efficient CO2 insertion of both amide groups under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus Lipid&#8201;A with a Unique Tetrasaccharide Backbone and Evaluation of Its Immunological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid A contained in fermented foods is expected to be a safe immunostimulant. The first chemical synthesis of fermentative bacteria Acetobacter pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, an immune component in black rice vinegar, was achieved via borinic acid catalyzed 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Furthermore, glucuronic acid residue, a unique structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, was found to largely contribute to its immunological and acid&#8208;stable properties.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid&#8197;A. Acetobacter pasteurianus is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2&#8208;trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of A.&#8197;pasteurianus LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A contributes to its high chemical stability.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ion Anchor Induced Highly Reversible Zn Anodes for High Performance Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy was proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, guiding the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged groups. While the negatively charged groups reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions, enabling AZMBs with high reversibility and extra&#8208;long lifespans.







Abstract
Unstable Zn interface with serious detrimental parasitic side&#8208;reactions and uncontrollable Zn dendrites severely plagues the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The interface stability was closely related to the electrolyte configuration and Zn2+ depositional behavior. In this work, a unique Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups. While the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side&#8208;reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000&#8197;hours long lifespan (0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH4V4O10||Zn pouch&#8208;cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4&#8201;% capacity retention for 180&#8197;cycles. A more practical 4&#8197;cm*4&#8197;cm sized pouch&#8208;cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0&#8197;mAh over 50&#8197;cycles.

In this work, a unique Zn-ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn-ions and guide the Zn-ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc-ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc-ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8722;NR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. While the negatively charged &#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn-ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side-reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000&#8197;hours long lifespan (0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;||Zn pouch-cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4&#8201;% capacity retention for 180&#8197;cycles. A more practical 4&#8197;cm*4&#8197;cm sized pouch-cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0&#8197;mAh over 50&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;selective Deoxygenative Coupling of Aliphatic Alcohols: Installation of Methyl Groups including Isotopic Labels by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reaction provides, for the first time, a cross&#8208;selective reaction of two alcohols. Methanol, activated as methyl tosylate, undergoes XEC with a range of secondary alcohols activated as the corresponding mesylates. Catalyst turnover is achieved with a stoichiometric reducing metal or electrochemically. This transformation provides facile incorporation of isotopic labels, by deuteration of ketone intermediates and/or employing isotopically labelled methanol.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions of two aliphatic alcohol derivatives remain a challenge. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive methylation reaction of aliphatic mesylates with methyl tosylate. This reaction provides straightforward access to compounds bearing aliphatic methyl groups from alkyl alcohol derivatives. Isotopically labelled substrates and reagents can be employed in the reaction to provide perdeuterated and 13C&#8208;labelled products. This transformation can be achieved by employing stoichiometric Mn reductant or electrochemically. Additionally, mechanistic experiments show that alkyl iodides are key intermediates in the transformation which undergo a stereoablative reaction via radical intermediates.

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.







Abstract
Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2&#8201;% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Multidimensional Functional Materials from Sequence&#8208;Defined Peptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between microscopic molecular structures of sequenced&#8208;defined peptoids and their resultant macroscopic assemblies was explored. By incorporating tetraphenylethylene and its derivative as functional groups at the termini of peptoid sequences, three&#8208;dimensional twisted bundles were evolved from discrete nanotubes or nanosheets, further enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly represents a powerful strategy for the fabrication of functional materials across various length scales. However, achieving precise formation of functional hierarchical assemblies remains a significant challenge and requires a profound understanding of molecular assembly interactions. In this study, we present a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the hierarchical assembly of sequence&#8208;defined peptoids into multidimensional functional materials, including twisted nanotube bundles serving as a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.

         <title>Germaaluminocenes&#8212;Masked Heterofulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity pattern of germaaluminocenes is determined by the dichotomy of the electron&#8208;deficient aluminum atom and the electron&#8208;rich germanium center. The analysis of the product spectra obtained from the reaction with standard reagents reveals the role of these main group sandwich complexes as synthetic equivalents of otherwise not accessible aluminagermapentafulvenes.







Abstract
Germaaluminocenes are formed by salt metathesis reactions of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediides with pentamethylcyclopentadienylaluminum dichloride. The reactivity pattern of these sandwich complexes is determined by the electrophilic central aluminum atom and by the nucleophilic dicoordinated germanium center. Surprisingly, the products formed by reactions with Lewis acids, Lewis bases, amphiphiles and compounds with polar double bonds are those expected from the reaction of a hypothetical aluminagermapentafulvene with these types of reagents. This suggests that germaaluminocenes are synthetic equivalents to these pentafulvenes.

In this work, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide nanofiber framework to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits.







Abstract
The development of highly producible and interfacial compatible in situ polymerized electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been plagued by insufficient transport kinetics and uncontrollable dendrite propagation. Herein, we seek to explore a rationally designed nanofiber architecture to balance all the criteria of SSLMBs, in which La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide (Zn&#8208;PI) nanofiber framework for the first time, to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate (PVC) electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits. Revealed by characterization and theoretical calculation under electric field, the positive&#8208;negative electrical dipole layer in LSC derived from electron migration between Co and O atoms aids in accelerating Li+ diffusion kinetics through densified electric field around filler particle, featuring a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.50&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and a high Li+ transference number of 0.91 without the risk of electron leakage. Integrating with the preferential sacrifice of ZnO/Zn3N2 on PI nanofiber upon immediate detection of dendritic Li, which takes part in reconfiguring hierarchical SEI chemistry dominated by LixNy/Li&#8722;Zn alloy inner layer and LiF outer layer, SSLMBs are further endowed with prolonged cycling lifespan and exceptional rate capability.

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explore the intriguing world of nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants at liquid interfaces. This study delves into how external electric fields can form and influence nanoparticle assemblies, leading to explosive emulsification behavior. It unveils a fascinating interplay between electrostatic forces and physiochemical conditions, offering a glimpse into the untapped possibilities of nanotechnology.







Abstract
Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900&#8197;nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum emission, spanning from blue to near&#8208;infrared (beyond 900&#8197;nm), is attainable in poly(diphenylmethane) through adjustments in both concentration and excitation wavelength, which is attributed to the formation of stable radicals within the polymer and through&#8208;space conjugation. This study not only confirms the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals but also introduces a pioneering method for producing nonconjugated near&#8208;infrared emitters.







Abstract
Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900&#8197;nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.

         <title>On the Mechanisms of Hypohalous Acid Formation and Electrophilic Halogenation by Non&#8208;Native Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic halogenases in nature are typically not efficient. Guided by flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase mechanisms and taking advantage of the versatile reactivity of a flavin hydroperoxide adduct and in situ generation of H2O2 by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, it was possible to promote the formation of a hypohalous acid&#8212;which is key for electrophilic halogenation&#8212;in various non&#8208;native halogenases by rerouting the flavin&#8208;generated peroxide.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. In this study, we used a mechanism&#8208;guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non&#8208;native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FlC4a&#8208;OOH), such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose&#8208;2&#8208;oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H2O2 were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry/fluorometry and product analysis indicate that FlC4a&#8208;OOH in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from FlC4a&#8208;OOH cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H2O2 generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming FlC4a&#8208;OOH can react with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenation.

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and nitrate serves as a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. Herein we proposed a urea generation pathway via the tandem reduction of nitrate and CO2, in which the critical C&#8722;N coupling is achieved by the interaction between the nitrate reduction intermediate of *NH2 and free CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8722; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15&#8201;%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33&#8201;%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.

However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst derived from MIL-125-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level of 15&#8201;%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33&#8201;%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>

Multimodal force sensor: A self&#8208;powered and self&#8208;recoverable force sensor based on trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer is presented. The magnitude of force can be converted into electrical responses, and force distribution can be visualized by optical signals simultaneously, without any power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. It has promising applications in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Unity Red Light Photoluminescence in Antimony Halide Crystals via Polyhedron Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinct emission color (i.e., red, orange, and yellow) through solvent engineering. It is found that higher coordination symmetry and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance are in favor of the larger Stokes shift and lower energy emission. This work sheds insights into the structure&#8208;photoluminescence relationship towards development of highly efficient optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Exploration of efficient red emitting antimony hybrid halide with large Stokes shift and zero self&#8208;absorption is highly desirable due to its enormous potential for applications in solid light emitting, and active optical waveguides. However, it is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, a series of (TMS)2SbCl5 (TMS=triphenylsulfonium cation) crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8722; configurations and distinctive emission color. Among them, cubic&#8208;phase (TMS)2SbCl5 shows bright red emission with a large Stokes shift of 312&#8197;nm. In contrast, monoclinic and orthorhombic (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals deliver efficient yellow and orange emission, respectively. Comprehensive structural investigations reveal that larger Stokes shift and longer&#8208;wavelength emission of cubic (TMS)2SbCl5 can be attributed to the larger lattice volume and longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distance, which favor sufficient structural aberration freedom at excited states. Together with robust stability, (TMS)2SbCl5 crystal family has been applied as optical waveguide with ultralow loss coefficient of 3.67&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, and shows superior performance in white&#8208;light emission and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. In short, our study provides a novel and fundamental perspective to structure&#8208;property&#8208;application relationship of antimony hybrid halides, which will contribute to future rational design of high&#8208;performance emissive metal halides.

         <title>A Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer&#8208;Free Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear photochromic reaction has been achieved in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam, which is easily synthesized from rhodamine B. Direct excitation with UV or blue light causes charge transfer and intersystem crossing, followed by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers to cause nonlinear behavior. In addition, using sensitizers enables the extension of the photoresponsivity from the blue to red region.







Abstract
Nonlinear photochromic reactions that work with weak incoherent light are important for molecular operations with high spatial resolution and multiple photofunctions based on single molecules. However, nonlinear photochromic compounds generally require complex molecular design, restricting accessibility in various fields. Herein, we report nonlinear photochromic properties in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam derivative (Rh&#8722;Pe), which is synthesized from rhodamine B in facile procedures. Direct excitation of Rh&#8722;Pe produces the triplet excited state via the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The triplet excited state causes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to bring the generation of the intensely colored ring&#8208;open form with nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, green&#8208; and red&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochromism was achieved in Rh&#8722;Pe using triplet sensitizers, although Rh&#8722;Pe can be directly excited only by ultraviolet and blue light. Our findings are expected to contribute to the development of photofunctional materials showing nonlinear behavior and low&#8208;energy light responsivity.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Induced Electrical and Magnetic Modulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposure to gaseous molecules can induce characteristic electrical and magnetic property changes of a semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The underlying interaction mechanism responsible for the electrical and magnetic modulation is found related to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the participating molecules which cause specific electronic and structural changes of the MOF.







Abstract
Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.

         <title>Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet effective spatial confinement strategy is proposed to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts through carbonizing a mesoporous silica&#8208;confined Co&#8722;Cu bimetal&#8211;organic framework for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. The optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst exhibits superior activity, outstanding stability, and magnetic recyclability for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis under extremely mild conditions.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H2 storage and release. Co&#8208;based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal&#8208;based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;confined bimetallic Co&#8722;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoxCu1&#8722;x@NC@mSiO2) were synthesized using a facile mSiO2&#8208;confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis at 298&#8197;K, surpassing most noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts. Moreover, Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 demonstrates magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8&#8201;% over 30&#8197;cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement. This work proposes a promising method for constructing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for AB hydrolysis.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Complementary Multicomponent Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry Co(III)Salphen&#8208;Based Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable, low&#8208;symmetry cages can be assembled by completing the octahedral coordination spheres of dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles with shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;pyridyl bridges, starting from labile Co(II) precursors under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
While metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is a popular technique to construct discrete nanosized objects, highly symmetric structures, built from one type of ligand at a time, are dominating reported systems. The tailored integration of a set of different ligands requires sophisticated approaches to avoid narcissistic separation or formation of statistical mixtures. Here, we demonstrate how the combination of three structure&#8208;guiding effects (metal&#8208;templated macrocyclization, additional bridging ligands and shape&#8208;complementarity) based on Co(III)salphen metal nodes allows for a rational and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of structurally complex, lantern&#8208;shaped cages with up to four differentiable bridges. Three new heteroleptic coordination cages based on dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles were synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction approach and fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. One cage groups two of the same ligands, another two different ligands around a symmetric Co2&#8208;bis&#8208;salphen ring. In the most complex structure, this ring is unsymmetric, rendering all four connections between the two metal centers distinguishable. While heteroleptic assembly around Pd(II) nodes has been shown to be dynamic, beneficial for cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations, assembly cascades and adaptive systems, the herein introduced cages based on kinetically more inert Co(III)salphen will be advantageous for applications in enzyme&#8208;like catalysis and molecular machinery that require enhanced structural and chemical stability.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Networks Capable of Retaining Crystalline Periodicity after Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization was constructed using a tetracarboxylic acid derivative with a dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene core.







Abstract
The molecular conformation, crystalline morphology, and properties of photochromic organic crystals can be controlled through photoirradiation, making them promising candidates for functional organic materials. However, photochromic porous molecular crystals with a networked framework structure are rare due to the difficulty in maintaining space that allows for photo&#8208;induced molecular motion in the crystalline state. This study describes a photo&#8208;responsive single crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) network of dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene derivative 4BDHP. A crystal composed of H&#8208;bonded undulate layers, 4BDHP&#8208;2, underwent photo&#8208;isomerization in the crystalline state due to loose stacking of the layers. Particularly, enantio&#8208;pure crystal (S,S)&#8208;4BDHP&#8208;2 allowed to reveal the structure of the photoisomerized crystal, in which the closed form (4BDHP) and open form (4CPD) were arranged alternately with keeping crystalline periodicity, although side reactions were also implied. The present proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system of a photochromic framework that retains crystalline periodicity after photo&#8208;isomerization may provide new light&#8208;driven porous functional materials.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Zincation and Alumination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal free catalytic C&#8722;H zincation and C&#8722;H alumination of heteroarenes using (&#946;&#8208;diketiminate)&#8208;metal complexes, where the only by&#8208;products are H2 or CH4, is reported. This is achieved by coupling endergonic C&#8722;H metalation with subsequent exergonic dehydrocoupling, with the latter process proceeding by metal&#8208;specific pathways.







Abstract
C&#8722;H metalation is the most efficient method to prepare aryl&#8211;zinc and &#8211;aluminium complexes that are ubiquitous nucleophiles. Virtually all C&#8722;H metalation routes to form Al/Zn organometallics require stoichiometric, strong Br&#248;nsted bases with no base&#8208;catalyzed reactions reported. Herein we present a catalytic in amine/ammonium salt (Et3N/[(Et3N)H]+) C&#8722;H metalation process to form aryl&#8208;zinc and aryl&#8208;aluminium complexes. Key to this approach is coupling an endergonic C&#8722;H metalation step with a sufficiently exergonic dehydrocoupling step between the ammonium salt by&#8208;product of C&#8722;H metalation ([(Et3N)H]+) and a Zn&#8722;H or Al&#8722;Me containing complex. This step, forming H2/MeH, makes the overall cycle exergonic while generating more of the reactive metal electrophile. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations revealed metal&#8208;specific dehydrocoupling pathways, with the divergent reactivity due to the different metal valency (which impacts the accessibility of amine&#8208;free cationic metal complexes) and steric environment. Notably, dehydrocoupling in the zinc system proceeds through a ligand&#8208;mediated pathway involving protonation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate C&#947; position. Given this process is applicable to two disparate metals (Zn and Al), other main group metals and ligand sets are expected to be amenable to this transition metal&#8208;free, catalytic C&#8722;H metalation.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methanol&#8208;assisted depolymerization of PS (PS&#8208;MAD) process was developed for effectively converting PS into value&#8208;added alkylbenzenes. Methanol is regarded as a hydrogen carrier decomposed in situ to provide moderate pressure of hydrogen which prevents benzene rings hydrogenation and promotes the depolymerization of PS. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS over Ru/SiO2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h.







Abstract
The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers, ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization of PS (denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h with the production rate of 118.1&#8197;mmolcarbon&#8201;gcatal.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies, methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photocatalysts in the Photoinduced Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds based on DMAC&#8208;TRZ and containing aryl subtituents on the DMAC donor have been applied as photocatalysts in the dehalogenation of aryl halides having Ered up to &#8722;2.72&#8197;V vs SCE. Mechanistic studies indicate that these DMAC&#8208;TRZ based compounds act as pre&#8208;photocatalysts and photodegrade under the reaction conditions, with the photodecomposition product responsible for the photocatalysis.







Abstract
We report a family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds based on derivatives of DMAC&#8208;TRZ, that are strongly photoreducing. Both Eox and thus E*ox could be tuned via substitution of the DMAC donor with a Hammett series of p&#8208;substituted phenyl moieties while Ered remained effectively constant. These compounds were assessed in the photoinduced dehalogenation of aryl halides, and analogues bearing electron withdrawing groups were found to produce the highest yields. Substrates of up to Ered=&#8722;2.72&#8197;V could be dehalogenated at low PC loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and under air, conditions much milder than previously reported for this reaction. Spectroscopic and chemical studies demonstrate that all PCs, including literature reference PCs, photodegrade, and that it is these photodegradation products that are responsible for the reactivity.

         <title>Synthesis of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Nanosheets with Tunable Silanol Nest Contents across an Ultra&#8208;wide pH Range and Their Catalytic Validation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for synthesizing ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets via aggregation crystallization of zeolite subcrystals within a broad pH range, detailing its crystallization process. pH manipulation enables precise control of silanol nest content, opening new avenues in zeolite engineering. Catalytic results in furfuryl alcohol etherification highlight the positive impact of regulating silanol nest content on catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Zeolite synthesis under acidic conditions has always presented a challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X) over a broad pH range (4 to 13) without the need for additional supplements. This achievement was realized through aggregation crystallization of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite subcrystal (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC) with highly short&#8208;range ordering and ultrasmall size extracted from the synthetic system of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC was investigated, revealing its non&#8208;classical crystallization process under mildly alkaline and acidic conditions (pH&lt;10), and the combination of classical and non&#8208;classical processes under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8805;10). What's particularly intriguing is that, the silanol nest content in the resultant Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X samples appears to be dependent on the pH values during the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC crystallization process rather than its crystallinity. Finally, the results of the furfuryl alcohol etherification reaction demonstrate that reducing the concentration of silanol nests significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X zeolite. The ability to synthesize zeolite in neutral and acidic environments without the additional mineralizing agents not only broadens the current view of traditional zeolite synthesis but also provides a new approach to control the silanol nest content of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of modulating photophysical properties by balancing the contradictory role of phenazaborine as a Lewis acid and an electron donor has been used to synthesize anion&#8208;responsive triarylborane compounds that displayed significant red&#8208;shift in their absorption and photoluminescence spectra in solution. This approach has also been successfully applied to modulate the emission color in polymer films.







Abstract
Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach for sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating the photophysical properties of TABs in a red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, by using a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display a distinct red&#8208;shift in their absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of a tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and enhancing the charge&#8208;transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating the photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to realize Type III porous liquids (PLs) with apertures larger than the solvent molecules. The 1st polymer layer, cross&#8208;linked poly (t&#8208;butyl methacrylate), serves as a physical barrier to block the solvent molecules from entering the MOF pore. The 2nd layer uses a solvent&#8208;compatible polymer to reduce PL viscosity. As a result, a PL bearing a 3.1&#8197;nm aperture was successfully constructed.







Abstract
The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1&#8197;nm.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Manganese(II) Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid chiral manganese chloride with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and high&#8208;thermal stability is presented. It is extremely promising for applications in red circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;LED) and X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides hold great potential as circularly polarized luminescence light sources. Herein, we have obtained two enantiomeric pairs of one&#8208;dimensional hybrid chiral manganese(II) chloride single crystals, R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;1) and R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;2), crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121. In comparison to R/S&#8208;1, R/S&#8208;2 single crystals not only show red emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high resistance to thermal quenching but also exhibit circularly polarized luminescence with an asymmetry factor (glum) of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, which can be attributed to the enhanced crystal rigidity resulting from the hydrogen bonding networks between R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine) cations and [MnCl6]4&#8722; chains. The circularly polarized luminescence activities originate from the asymmetric [MnCl6]4&#8722; luminophores induced by N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl hydrogen bonding with R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine). Moreover, these samples demonstrate great application potential in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. This work shows a highly efficient photoluminescent Mn&#8208;based halide and offers a strategy for designing multifunctional chiral metal halides.

         <title>Water&#8208;Ice Microstructures and Hydration States of Acridinium Iodide Studied by Phosphorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorescence spectroscopy was utilized to visualize the microstructure transition of water at varying temperatures from 298&#8197;K to 77&#8197;K at a probe concentration of ~10&#8722;5&#8197;M, showing higher sensitivity by at least two orders of magnitude than absorption&#8208;base techniques. By this unique means, it was found that a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of organic hydrophiles could thoroughly prevent the crystallization of water ice at freezing temperatures.







Abstract
Ice has been suggested to have played a significant role in the origin of life partly owing to its ability to concentrate organic molecules and promote reaction efficiency. However, the techniques for studying organic molecules in ice are absorption&#8208;based, which limits the sensitivity of measurements. Here we introduce an emission&#8208;based method to study organic molecules in water ice: the phosphorescence displays high sensitivity depending on the hydration state of an organic salt probe, acridinium iodide (ADI). The designed ADI aqueous system exhibits phosphorescence that can be severely perturbed when the temperature is higher than 110&#8197;K at a concentration of the order of 10&#8722;5&#8197;M, indicating changes in hydration for ADI. Using the ADI phosphorescent probe, it is found that the microstructures of water ice, i.e., crystalline vs. glassy, can be strongly dictated by a trace amount (as low as 10&#8722;5&#8197;M) of water&#8208;soluble organic molecules. Consistent with cryoSEM images and temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectral data, the ADI is dehydrated in more crystalline ice and hydrated in more glassy ice. The current investigation serves as a starting point for using more sensitive spectroscopic techniques for studying water&#8208;organics interactions at a much lower concentration and wider temperature range.

         <title>Synergistic Al&#8722;Al Dual&#8208;Atomic Site for Efficient Artificial Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;metal bonded dual&#8208;atomic Al&#8722;Al site was designed and synthesized on a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix for the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3. The catalyst with the bonded Al2&#8208;pair site exhibited high Faradaic efficiency and selective NH3 generation. The mechanism follows a six&#8208;electrons transfer pathway for the selective generation of NH3, as revealed by operando surface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis of ammonia by electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it is commonly obstructed by the high activation energy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of an Al&#8722;Al bonded dual atomic catalyst stabilized within an amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix (Al2NC) with high NRR performance. The dual atomic Al2&#8208;sites act synergistically to catalyze the complex multiple steps of NRR through adsorption and activation, enhancing the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This Al2NC catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 16.56&#177;0.3&#8201;% with a yield rate of 29.22&#177;1.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1. The dual atomic Al2NC catalyst shows long&#8208;term repeatable, and stable NRR performance. This work presents an insight into the identification of synergistic dual atomic catalytic site and mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Confined&#8208;Coordination Induced Intergrowth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks into Precise Molecular Sieving Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (solvents: water and DMF) were regulated to decrease the MOF nucleation and growth rate during membrane formation process, alleviating the preferential generation of MOF in the bulk solution and facilitating the intergrowth of MOF crystals into integrated membrane layer with progressively eliminating defects, which endows the MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures showing excellent H2/CO2 separation and water desalination performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with rich functionality and tunable pore system are promising for precise molecular separation; however, it remains a challenge to develop defect&#8208;free high&#8208;connectivity MOF membrane with high water stability owing to uncontrollable nucleation and growth rate during fabrication process. Herein, we report on a confined&#8208;coordination induced intergrowth strategy to fabricate lattice&#8208;defect&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOF membrane towards precise molecular separation. The confined&#8208;coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (water or DMF) were regulated to slow down the coordination reaction rate via controlling the counter&#8208;diffusion of MOF precursors (metal cluster and ligand), thereby inter&#8208;growing MOF crystals into integrated membrane. The resulting Zr&#8208;MOF membrane with angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures exhibits excellent separation performance both for gas separation and water desalination process. It was achieved H2 permeance of ~1200 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of ~67; water permeance of ~8&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and MgCl2 rejection of ~95&#8201;%, which are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The molecular transport mechanism related to size&#8208;sieving effect and transition energy barrier differential of molecules and ions was revealed by density functional theory calculations. Our work provides a facile approach and fundamental insights towards developing precise molecular sieving membranes.

         <title>Regulating the Topology of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall H2O2 Photogeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking site design, two novel two dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar chemical constitutions but different topologies were constructed. TBD&#8208;COF with six&#8208;arm cores and cpt topology exhibited better H2O2 photosynthetic activity than TBC&#8208;COF with three&#8208;arm cores and hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2.&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2.&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three channels, inspiring regulating the topology of COFs for boosting overall H2O2 photogeneration.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions and water oxidation reactions are extremely promising green approaches for massive H2O2 production. Nonetheless, constructing effective photocatalysts for H2O2 generation is critical and still challenging. Since the network topology has significant impacts on the electronic properties of two dimensional (2D) polymers, herein, for the first time, we regulated the H2O2 photosynthetic activity of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by topology. Through designing the linking sites of the monomers, we synthesized a pair of novel COFs with similar chemical components on the backbones but distinct topologies. Without sacrificial agents, TBD&#8208;COF with cpt topology exhibited superior H2O2 photoproduction performance (6085 and 5448&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in O2 and air) than TBC&#8208;COF with hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three paths. Further experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that during the H2O2 photosynthetic process, the charge carrier separation efficiency, O2&#8901;&#8722; generation and conversion, and the energy barrier of the rate determination steps in the three channels, related to the formation of *OOH, *O21, and *OH, can be well tuned by the topology of COFs. The current study enlightens the fabrication of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for H2O2 production by topological structure modulation.

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a computational pipeline that identifies peptide epitopes that bind a particular receptor from a library of possible protein sequences (e.g., coming from high&#8208;throughput experiments). The pipeline uses an AlphaFold&#8208;Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to rank order different plausible epitopes and select the most likely one.







Abstract
Identifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method&#8216;s speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of enantiomeric macrocycles, RRRR&#8208; and SSSS&#8208;C[4]BINOL, demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards 16 important steroidal compounds in aqueous solutions, establishing them the most effective known steroid receptors. The two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids in biofluids.







Abstract
The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear photochromic reaction of a rhodamine spirolactam derivative easily synthesized from rhodamine B has been achieved in the Research Article (e202404140) by Yuki Nagai, Yoichi Kobayashi et&#8197;al. The nonlinear behavior results from efficient intersystem crossing and thereby triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers. In addition, using triplet sensitizers extends the responsive wavelength from the blue to red region.

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (EF&#8208;DCPNs) emerge as breakthrough solutions to address the trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and dynamic behaviors, while greatly eliminating environmental impacts. This review summarizes current status of synthesis, properties, and applications of EF&#8208;DCPNs and provides perspectives on the future development in this important field.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.

         <title>Best Practices for Experiments and Reports in Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intends to establish standardized practices for experimental procedures and reporting metrics in photocatalytic CH4 conversion. It is structured into sections that focus on reactor design, products measurement and definition of performance metrics. We provide comprehensive insights into the field of photocatalytic CH4 conversion, and envision that this overview will promote the transition of solar fuel technology from laboratory to manufacture.







Abstract
Efficiently converting methane into valuable chemicals via photocatalysis under mild condition represents a sustainable route to energy storage and value&#8208;added manufacture. Despite continued interest in this area, the achievements have been overshadowed by the absence of standardized protocols for conducting photocatalytic methane oxidation experiments as well as evaluating the corresponding performance. In this review, we present a structured solution aimed at addressing these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the norms underlying reactor design and outline various configurations in the gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid reaction systems. This discussion helps choosing the suitable reactors for methane conversion experiments. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol applicable to diverse methane&#8208;conversion reactions. Emphasizing meticulous verification and accurate quantification of the products, this protocol highlights the significance of mitigating contamination sources and selecting appropriate detection methods. Lastly, we propose the standardized performance metrics crucial for evaluating photocatalytic methane conversion. By defining these metrics, the community could obtain the consensus of assessing the performance across different studies. Moving forward, the future of photocatalytic methane conversion necessitates further refinement of stringent experimental standards and evaluation criteria. Moreover, development of scalable reactor is essential to facilitate the transition from laboratory proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to potentially industrial production.

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis employing particulate semiconductors represents a promising approach for sustainable production of valuable chemical feedstock. Metal poly(heptazine imide) (MPHI), a novel 2D ionic carbon nitride, has been recognized as an emerging photocatalyst with distinctive properties. In this minireview, we first delineate the forefront innovations of MPHI photocatalysts, spanning from synthetic strategies and solving structures to the exploration of novel properties. We place special emphasis on the structural design principles aimed at developing high&#8208;performance MPHI systems toward photocatalytic solar fuel production such as H2 evolution, H2O oxidation, H2O2 production and CO2 reduction. Finally, we discuss crucial insights and challenges in leveraging highly active MPHIs for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Disaggregation&#8208;Activated pan&#8208;COX Imaging Agents for Human Soft tissue Sarcoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
First disaggregation induced pan&#8208;COX imaging agents shed light on cancer stem cells in human sarcoma tissue. Using the pan&#8208;COX targeting indomethacin conjugated BODIPY fluorophore, disaggregation dependent turn&#8208;on chemosensor was designed for parafin&#8208;fixed tissue imaging. Disaggregation schematics are created with BioRender.com







Abstract
Cancer stem cells are pivotal players in tumors initiation, growth, and metastasis. While several markers have been identified, there remain challenges particularly in heterogeneous malignancies like adult soft tissue sarcomas, where conventional markers are inherently overexpressed. Here, we designed BODIPY scaffold fluorescence probes (BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2) that activate via disaggregation targeting for cyclooxygenase (COX), a potential marker for CSCs in sarcoma in clinical pathology. Based on their structures, BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 showcased higher susceptibility to disaggregation compared to BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2, consistent with their selective interaction with COX. Notably, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 revealed positive cooperativity binding to COX&#8208;2 at sub&#8208;micromolar ranges. Both probes showed significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon LPS or PMA triggered COX&#8208;2 upregulation in live RAW264.7, HeLa, and human sarcoma cell line (Saos&#8208;LM2) up to 2&#8208;fold increase with negligible toxicity. More importantly, the BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1 demonstrated their practical imaging for COX&#8208;2 positive cells in paraffin&#8208;fixed human sarcoma tissue. Considering the fixed tissues are most practiced pathological sample, our finding suggests a potential of disaggregation activated chemosensor for clinical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;Based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous partitioning of MOF particles into one polymer domain in a phase separated&#8208;mixed matrix membrane (PS&#8208;MMM) realizes rapid ranking of the interfacial compatibility of various MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. This strategy will be a valuable tool to guide the design of MMMs with more predictable gas separation properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF&#8208;polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Photo&#8208;Driven Sequential Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>

An unprecedented photo&#8208;driven quadruple sequential sigmatropic rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynylketones with aminals via 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate is disclosed. This protocol provides a facile access to synthetically useful multi&#8208;substituted conjugated dienes in highly stereoselective manner via visible light catalysis in mild conditions.







Abstract
We here reported a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was promoted by photo&#8208;irridation and involved with 1,6&#8208;dipolar intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were implemented in one operational step. This protocol provided a modular tool for constructing dienes from amines, pyrazoles and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones in one&#8208;pot manner. The results of mechanistic investigation indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement instead of the 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.

The results of mechanistic investigation indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6-sigmatropic rearrangement instead of the 1,5-sigmatropic rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored pyridine reagents undergo nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH) reactions with activated pyridines to afford pyridyl pyridinium salts in C4&#8208;selectivity. These salts can be in situ converted to 4&#8208;aminopyridines by aqueous ammonia or utilized as synthetic linchpins for general pyridine C4&#8208;functionalization. The elucidation of the selectivity principles has further guided the C4&#8208;selective functionalization of other (di)azines.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with the maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8722;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutane Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), with 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone, have been developed to demonstrate exceptional thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) and resistance to hydrolysis (intact in pH&#8197;0&#8211;14). Distinguished from classic polyesters, they exhibit good chemical circularity and offer adjustable material performances comparable to those of non&#8208;degradable syndiotactic polystyrene and low&#8208;density polyethylene.







Abstract
Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.

         <title>Selective Defluorination of Trifluoromethyl Substituents by Conformationally Induced Remote Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide derivatives of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes, and their heterocyclic congeners, may be selectively cyclodefluorinated by a remote substitution reaction under mild conditions, giving difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes after hydrolysis. Selective single and double defluorinations are possible using this method, which provides a versatile route to difluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
The selective reduction of an aromatic trifluoromethyl substituent to a difluoromethyl substituent may be achieved by base&#8208;promoted elimination to form a difluoro&#8208;p&#8208;quinomethide which is trapped by an intramolecular nucleophile. High yields are obtained when the nucleophilic trap entails the conformationally favoured cyclisation of an aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) derivative. The resulting cyclised difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted arylimidazolidinone products are readily converted to versatile difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes by reduction and hydrolysis. Defluorination is successful on a range of benzenoid (both para and ortho CF3&#8208;substituted) and heterocyclic substrates. Double defluorination may likewise be achieved sequentially, or in a single step, from an Aib dipeptide derivative.

         <title>Perfluorooxosulfate Salts as SOF4&#8208;Gas&#8208;Free Precursors to Multidimensional SuFEx Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) are excellent multidimensional SuFEx hubs, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) gas limits this chemistry. Here, we propose silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable alternative to SOF4. Prepared by the AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2, we found that the adduct produces sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields from primary amines, also extendable to AgOSF4CF3.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry stands as a well&#8208;established method for swiftly constructing complex molecules in a modular fashion. An especially promising segment of this toolbox is reserved for multidimensional SuFEx hubs: three or more substituents pluggable into a singular SVI centre to make &#8216;beyond&#8208;linear&#8217; clicked constructions. Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) stand out as the prime example of this, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) limits this chemistry to only a few laboratories with access to this gas. In this work, we identify silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable SuFEx hub with reactivity equal to SOF4. The AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2 gives rise to the hexacoordinate AgOSF5 adduct, which in contact with primary amines produces the sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields. In addition, we have found this workflow to be fully extendable to the trifluoromethyl homologue, AgOSF4CF3, and we propose the use of AgOSF4X salts as a general route to azasulfur SuFEx electrophiles from commercial starting materials.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are excellent multidimensional SuFEx hubs, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) gas limits this chemistry. Here, we propose silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) as a viable alternative to SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Prepared by the AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated oxidation of SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we found that the adduct produces sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields from primary amines, also extendable to AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry stands as a well-established method for swiftly constructing complex molecules in a modular fashion. An especially promising segment of this toolbox is reserved for multidimensional SuFEx hubs: three or more substituents pluggable into a singular S&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt; centre to make &#8216;beyond-linear&#8217; clicked constructions. Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) stand out as the prime example of this, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) limits this chemistry to only a few laboratories with access to this gas. In this work, we identify silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) as a viable SuFEx hub with reactivity equal to SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The AgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated oxidation of SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to the hexacoordinate AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; adduct, which in contact with primary amines produces the sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields. In addition, we have found this workflow to be fully extendable to the trifluoromethyl homologue, AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and we propose the use of AgOSF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X salts as a general route to azasulfur SuFEx electrophiles from commercial starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Tertiary Amines: Introducing Secondary Amines by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Ortho Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of secondary amines at the aryl iodide ortho position by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis has been developed, which leads to versatile synthetic applications, such as primary amino group installation and concise heterocycle formations.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE)&#8208;catalyzed ortho amination in 2013, escaping the limitation of only yielding tertiary anilines has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we describe that, by carefully choosing the phosphine ligand and NBE mediator, the installation of a N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylamino group becomes feasible. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aryl iodide substrates and various N&#8208;mono&#8208;tertiary alkylamine&#8208;derived electrophiles. Both ipso alkenylation and alkynylation can be realized. The synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the formation of primary amino group via selective deprotection and streamlined access to N&#8208;heterocycles. Preliminary success of installing a bulky N&#8208;secondary alkylamino group and a mechanistic understanding of the decomposition pathways of mono N&#8208;alkylamine electrophiles have been obtained.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Linearizable Cyclization/Coupling with Detachable Silicon&#8208;Oxygen Linker: Access to 1,2&#8208;Oxasilolanes, 3&#8208;Hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;Arylalkanols</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/coupling has been developed in which the products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8722;Si&#8722;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 24, June 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization competition between conjugated backbones and side chains is critical to obtaining modulated microstructures and improved properties of conjugated polymers. A buffer chain model is proposed here to describe the linker between backbone and side chains. Longer buffer chains in a model polymer system could effectively relieve this crystallization competition, resulting in better charge transport performance.







Abstract
It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Quantitative Kinetic Insights from Operando&#8208;UV&#8208;Vis Spectroscopy: An Application to NH3&#8208;SCR of NOx on Cu&#8208;CHA Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We employ UV&#8208;Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy directly coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic information. We use as a show&#8208;case the CuII/CuI redox dynamics during the reduction half cycle of the NH3&#8208;Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) on Cu&#8208;CHA catalysts. Our measurements enable quantification of the fraction of oxidized Cu, reconstructed by Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) together with monitoring of the gas&#8208;phase evolution during the reaction. These data both on the dynamics of the gas&#8208;phase and of the active site oxidation state have been used to assess the reduction half cycle rate equation and estimate the rate constant. Our results in terms of reaction orders and kinetic constant are in line with previous findings in the literature. Overall, our results demonstrate that the combined analysis of the UV spectra and of the gas&#8208;phase dynamics provides converging and unparalleled kinetic insight: this approach effectively resolves ambiguities concerning RHC kinetics and mechanism. More in general, this work provides evidence that operando spectroscopy can be used to extract quantitative kinetic information on catalytic cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymes in Synergy: Bacteria Specific Molecular Probe for Locoregional Imaging of Urinary Tract Infection in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uropathogenic Escherichia coli&#160;(UPECs)&#160;is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8208;90% of community or hospital&#8208;acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence,&#160;imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor&#8208;intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UPECs&#160;fluorescent probe (NO&#8208;AH) capable of specifically targeting&#160;UPECs&#160;through its&#160;collaborative&#160;response to bacterial enzymes,&#160;enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro&#160;and in vivo.&#160;Our NO&#8208;AH probe incorporates&#160;a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts&#160;with&#160;OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino&#160;acid residue conjugated&#160;with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such&#160;liberated fragment would be subsequently&#160;recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for&#160;precise imaging&#160;of UTIs in complex living environments.&#160;The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8208;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs&#8208;infected UTIs, which could overcome&#160;misdiagnosis in&#160;conventional urine tests,&#160;thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Prediction&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Thiophosphates as Promising Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical bandgap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali&#8208;alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates LiCaPS4 (Ama2), NaCaPS4 (P21), KCaPS4 (Pna21), RbCaPS4 (Pna21), CsCaPS4 (Pna21) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide bandgap (3.77&#8208;3.86 eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8208;0.064 at 1064 nm), high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10 &#215; AGS), and suitable phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8208;0.6 &#215; AGS). Structure&#8208;properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8208;S bonds show non&#8208;ignorable covalent feature, and [PS4] together with [CaSn] units play dominant roles to determine the bandgap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208; analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high&#8208;performance function materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Short&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Excited States and Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission is of great importance for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. Herein, based on the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy for modifying the short range charge transfer excited state energies of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we introduce one or two nitrogen atoms into the central benzene ring of a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton. This approach resulted in the stabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus systematic hypsochromic shifts and narrowing spectra. In toluene solution, two heterocyclic&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecules, Py&#8208;BN and Pm&#8208;BN, exhibit deep&#8208;blue emissions with high photoluminescence quantum yields of 93% and 94%, and narrow full width at half maximum of 14 and 13 nm, respectively. A deep&#8208;blue hyperfluorescent OLED based on Py&#8208;BN exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.7% and desired color purity with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.052). These results demonstrate the significant potential for the development of deep blue narrowband MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent C=C/C=N Metathesis Reaction for Associative Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), leveraging the dynamic exchange of covalent bonds, emerge as a promising material to address the challenge of irreversible cross&#8208;linking in thermosetting polymers. In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress&#8208;relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;Benzene Multi&#8208;Macrocyclic Nanocarbons via Post&#8208;Functionalization of meta&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the diversity of multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons, particularly those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds, represents intriguing yet challenging synthetic tasks. Complementary to the existing synthetic approaches, here we report an efficient and modular post&#8208;functionalization strategy employing iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H borylation of the highly strained meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes (mCPPs) and an mCPP&#8208;derived catenane. Based on the functionalized macrocyclic synthons, a number of novel all&#8208;benzene topological structures including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane have been successfully prepared and characterized, thereby showcasing the synthetic utility and potential of the post&#8208;functionalization strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Transpiration&#8208;induced self&#8208;growth of texture hydrogel surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trees grow by coupling the transpiration&#8208;induced nutrient absorption from external sources and photosynthesis&#8208;based nutrient integration. Inspired by this manner, we designed a class of polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels containing isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids for growing texture surfaces. The isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids were created via irreversible matrix reconfiguration in a deswelling&#8208;swelling process. During transpiration, these voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources and deliver them to the surface of the samples for photopolymerization. This growth process is spatial&#8208;controllable and can be applied to fabricate complex patterns consisting of different compositions, suggesting a new strategy for making texture surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14 years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8209;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8211;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Packing Polymorphism of Oxindole: An Exploration Inspired by Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal polymorphism, characterized by different packing arrangements of the same compound, strongly ties to the physical properties of a molecule. Determining the polymorphic landscape is complex and time&#8208;consuming, with the number of experimentally observed polymorphs varying widely from molecule to molecule. Furthermore, disappearing polymorphs, the phenomenon whereby experimentally observed forms cannot be reproduced, pose a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, we focused on oxindole (OX), a small rigid molecule with four known polymorphs, including a reported disappearing form. Using crystal structure prediction (CSP), we assessed OX solid&#8208;state landscape and thermodynamic stability by comparing predicted structures with experimentally known forms. We then performed melt and solution crystallization in bulk and nanoconfinement to validate our predictions. These experiments successfully reproduced the known forms and led to the discovery of four novel polymorphs. Our approach provided insights into reconstructing disappearing polymorphs and building more comprehensive polymorph landscapes. These results also establish a new record of packing polymorphism for rigid molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Photogenerated Electrons and Holes toward Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directly coupling N2 and CO2 to synthesize urea by photocatalysis paves a sustainable route for urea synthesis, but its performance is limited by the competition of photogenerated electrons between N2 and CO2, as well as the underutilized photogenerated holes. Herein, we report an efficient urea synthesis process involving photogenerated electrons and holes in respectively converting CO2 and N2 over a redox heterojunction consisting of WO3 and Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;decorated CdS (Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3). For the photocatalytic urea synthesis from N2 and CO2 in pure water, Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3 attained a urea yield rate of 78 &#956;M&#183;h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 0.15 % at 385 nm, which ranked among the best photocatalytic urea synthesis performance reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that the N2 was converted into NO species by &#8901;OH radicals generated from photogenerated holes over the WO3 component, meanwhile, the CO2 was transformed into *CO species over the Ni site by photogenerated electrons. The generated NO and *CO species were further coupled to form *OCNO intermediate, then gradually transformed into urea. This work emphasizes the importance of reasonably utilizing photogenerated holes in photocatalytic reduction reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau participates in neurotransmission regulation via its interaction with synaptic vesicles (SVs). The precise nature and mechanics of tau's engagement with SVs, especially regarding alterations in vesicle dynamics, remain a matter of discussion. We report an electrochemical method using a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette to monitor vesicle dynamics induced by tau. A model vesicle of ~30 nm is confined within a lipid&#8208;modified nanopipette orifice with a comparable diameter to mimic the synaptic lipid environment. Both tau and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau) present two&#8208;state dynamic behavior in this biomimetic system, showing typical ionic current oscillation, induced by lipid&#8208;tau interaction. The results indicate that p&#8208;tau has a stronger affinity to the lipid vesicles in the confined environment, blocking the vesicle movement to a higher degree. Taken together, this method bridges a gap for sensing synaptic vesicle dynamics in a confined lipid environment, mimicking vesicle movement near the synaptic membrane. These findings contribute to understanding how different types of tau protein regulate synaptic vesicle motility and to underlying its functional and pathological behaviours in disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N&#8208;terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker &#8208; thiolation domain &#8208; linker fragment that is resident at the C&#8208;terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been recently shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to that of maser, potentially enabling new ways of sensing of hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50 clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300 MHz resonance frequency in preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3 ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of MR detector (up to 1 million) were demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic upgrading of plastic and biomass&#8208;derived polyols to formamide under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7 &#956;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2% at a constant current of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in&#8208;situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles of Ferric Peroxide Anion Intermediates (Fe3+O2&#8211;, Compound 0) in Cytochrome P450 19A1 Steroid Aromatization and a Cytochrome P450 2B4 Secosteroid Oxidation Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) 19A1 is the steroid aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the 3&#8208;step conversion of androgens (androstenedione or testosterone) to estrogens. The final step is C&#8208;C bond scission (removing the 19&#8208;oxo group as formic acid) that proceeds via a historically controversial reaction mechanism. The two competing mechanistic possibilities involve a ferric peroxide anion (Fe3+O2&#8211;, Compound 0) and a perferryl oxy species (FeO3+, Compound I). One approach to discern the role of each species in the reaction is with the use of oxygen&#8208;18 labeling, i.e., from&#160;18O2&#160;and H218O of the reaction product formic acid. We applied this approach, using several technical improvements, to study the deformylation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione by human P450 19A1 and of a model secosteroid, 3&#8208;oxodecaline&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;10&#8208;carboxaldehyde (ODEC), by rabbit P450 2B4. Both aldehyde substrates were sensitive to non&#8208;enzymatic acid&#8208;catalyzed deformylation, yielding 19&#8208;norsteroids, and conditions were established to avoid issues with artifactual generation of formic acid. The Compound 0 reaction pathway predominated (i.e., Fe3+O2&#8211;) in both P450 19A1 oxidation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione and P450 2B4 oxidation of ODEC. The P450 19A1 results contrast with our prior conclusions (J. Am. Chem. Soc.&#160;2014, 136, 15016&#8211;16025), attributed to several technical modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid Phase Formation and Sb3+ Doping of Tin (IV) Halide Hybrids toward Photoluminescence Enhancement and Tuning for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;excitonic emitting materials in luminescent metal halides are emerging candidates for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. Herein, ATPP2SnCl6 (ATPP = acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) phase was designed and synthesized by rationally choosing emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and non&#8208;toxic stable metal ions of Sn4+, and Sb3+ was further doped into ATPP2SnCl6 to tune the photoluminescence with external self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The derived non&#8208;toxic ATPP2SnCl6 shows multi&#8208;excitonic luminescent centers verified by optical study and differential charge&#8208;density from density functional theory calculations. Incorporation of Sb3+ dopants and the increasing concentrations induce the efficient energy transfer therein, thus enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield from 5.1% to 73.8%. The multi&#8208;excitonic emission inspires the creation of information encryption and decryption by leveraging the photoluminescence from ATPPCl to ATPP2SnCl6 host and ATPP2SnCl6:Sb3+. This study facilitates the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application by employing solution&#8208;processable luminescent metal halides materials with excitation&#8208;dependent PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Magicking an oxyhalide interface for 4.8 V&#8208;tolerant high&#8208;nickel cathodes in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte. To circumvent this issue, we propose a simple but effective approach to magic the adverse surface alkali into a uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Due to the enhancement of the close contact at interface, the ASSBs exhibit improved kinetic performance across a broad temperature range, especially at the freezing point. Besides, owing to the high&#8208;voltage tolerance of the protective layer, ASSBs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability under high cutoff voltages (500 cycles ~ 94.0% at 4.5 V, 200 cycles ~ 80.4% at 4.8 V). This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200 mA h g&#8208;1 at 1.75 mA cm&#8208;2) and capacity retention (94% over 300 cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8208; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+ ~ 0.94). With 90 wt% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at 30&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercialising solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Decoupled Coordination Chemistries Enable Quasi&#8208;Eutectic Electrolytes with Fast Kinetics toward Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eutectic electrolytes show potential beyond conventional low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) in zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) yet suffer from high viscosity and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we originally develop an intrinsically decoupling strategy to address these issues, producing a novel electrolyte termed "quasi&#8208;eutectic" electrolyte (quasi&#8208;EE). Joint experimental and theoretical analyses confirm its unique solution coordination structure doped with near&#8208;LCE domains. This enables the quasi&#8208;EE well inherit the advanced properties at deep&#8208;eutectic states while provide facilitated kinetics as well as lower energy barriers via a vehicle/hopping&#8208;hybridized charge transfer mechanism. Consequently, a homogeneous electroplating pattern with much enhanced Sand&#42892;s time is achieved on the Zn surface, followed by a twofold prolonged service&#8208;life with drastically reduced concentration polarization. More encouragingly, the quasi&#8208;EE also delivers increased capacitance output in ZICs, which is elevated by 12.4%&#8208;144.6% compared to that before decoupling. Furthermore, the pouch cell with a cathodic mass loading of 36.6 mg cm&#8208;2 maintains competitive cycling performances over 600 cycles, far exceeding other Zn&#8208;based counterparts. This work offers fresh insights into eutectic decoupling and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Sulfur Reduction Pathways via Cisplatin Enables High Performance in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) is an attractive 16&#8208;electron transfer process that endows Li&#8208;S batteries with a theoretical capacity of 1,672 mAh g&#8208;1. However, the slow kinetics and complex pathways of the SRR cause the shuttling of soluble polysulfides (PSs), thus fast capacity fading. Here, we report using cisplatin (cis&#8208;Pt) as a novel mediator to improve the SRR kinetics and a molecular probe to identify the SRR pathways. We show that cis&#8208;Pt with a reductive Pt2+ center can directly slice the S&#8208;S bonds of PSs, leading to enhanced charge transfer kinetics, guided SRR pathways, and depth conversion of PSs to Li2S. With cis&#8208;Pt added, Li&#8208;S coin cells deliver a maximum specific capacity of 1,437 mAh g&#8208;1 and a capacity decay of 0.017% per cycle after 1000 cycles, while a pouch cell with a practical electrolyte&#8208;sulfur ratio (2.5 &#956;l mg&#8208;1) exhibits a high energy density of 318.8 Wh kg&#8208;1. Our mechanistic studies reveal that cis&#8208;Pt steers the cathodic SRR pathways by generating redox active cis&#8208;Pt/PSs complexes, enabling the replacement of the sluggish SRR with a faster redox cycling of Pt4+/Pt2+ pairs. These findings provide insights into the rational design of functional mediators for tackling the cathodic challenges inside Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;Principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the consideration of H coverage effect, the activity of reformate hydrogenation was evaluated according to descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energy of atomic hydrogen, and the selectivity was determined based on adsorption energy of benzene. 172 stable alloys were scanned, and Zn3Ir1 alloy was found to present high performance, which was verified by experiments.







Abstract
The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Shuttling in Ammonia by Neutral and Cationic Boron&#8208;Containing Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8211;B(ArX)H (where ArX&#160;= C6F5&#160;(ArF) or C6Cl5&#160;(ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#183;BArXH2&#160;with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2&#160;(R = Ph,&#160;iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8211;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8211;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#183;&#183;&#183;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17 kcal mol&#8208;1&#160;thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8208;&#160;conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B&#160;p&#160;bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX&#160;group.

The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8211;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four-coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8211;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#183;&#183;&#183;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17 kcal mol-1&#160;thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N-to-P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]-&#160;conjugate base through N-to-B&#160;p&#160;bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B-bound ArX&#160;group. It is viable in the case of C6F5&#160;substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor-stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5&#160;substituent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7 has been achieved via an acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Immunological activity tests indicate that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.







Abstract
Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1)&#8197;acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2)&#8197;combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic linkage, 3)&#8197;bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4)&#8197;stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cyclized Polyacrylonitrile as an Electron Selective Layer for n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cell with Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. The CPAN layer possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and is insoluble in common solvents. The resultant PSC affords a power conversion efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% with high operational stability.







Abstract
In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed to replace n&#8208;type metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2 or SnO2) as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The CPAN layer is fabricated via facile in situ cyclization reaction of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coated on a conducting glass substrate. The CPAN layer is robust and insoluble in common solvents, and possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. With the CPAN as an ESL, the PSC affords a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.12&#8201;%, which is the highest for the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with organic ESLs. Moreover, the device with the CPAN layer holds superior operational stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 500&#8197;h continuous light soaking. These results confirm that the CPAN layer would be a desirable low&#8208;cost and efficient ESL for n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs and other photoelectronic devices with high performance and stability.

         <title>Rapid Defect Engineering in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 Hybrid for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis: A Pathway to High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the defect engineering, ultrasonic cavitation was utilized to rapidly introduce different types of defects into a FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 coating to increase edge unsaturated active sites. Simultaneously, different defects synergistically enhance the oxygenophilicity character, allowing the coating to activate the surface reconstruction into highly active catalytic species at low potential.







Abstract
Rational modulation of surface reconstruction in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers is a topical interest in the field of catalysis. The introduction of point defects has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts, but the influence of more complex planar defects (e.g., twins and stacking faults), on their intrinsic activity is still not fully understood. This study harnesses ultrasonic cavitation for rapid and controlled introduction of different types of defects in the FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 hybrid coating, optimizing OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the different defects optimize the coordination environment and facilitate the activation of surface reconstruction into true catalytic activity centers at lower potentials. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional durability, maintaining stable oxygen production at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 120&#8197;hours. This work not only presents a novel pathway for designing advanced electrocatalysts but also deepens our understanding of defect&#8208;engineered catalytic mechanisms, showcasing the potential for rapid and efficient enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>A Thermosalient and Mechanically Compliant Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Switcher</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystalline material exhibiting both plastic bending and thermosalient behavior with reversible crystal movement during phase transition is reported. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. This unique combination enables switching of the material&#8216;s waveguiding ability within a narrow temperature range, promising applications in heat&#8208;sensitive electronics like central processing units. Being entirely organic, it offers reduced weight compared to the materials that are currently being used in electronics.







Abstract
The dense and ordered molecular arrangements endow dynamic molecular crystals with fast response, rapid energy conversion, low energy dissipation, and strong coupling between heat/light and mechanical energy. Most of the known dynamic crystals can only respond to a single stimulus, and materials that can respond to multiple stimuli are rare. Here, we report an organic crystalline material that can be bent plastically and is also thermosalient, as its crystals can move when they undergo a reversible phase transition. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. The combination of light transduction and reversible thermomechanical deformation provides an opportunity to switch the waveguiding capability of the material in a narrow temperature range, which holds a tremendous potential for applications in heat&#8208;averse electronic components, such as central processing units. Unlike existing electronics, the material we report here is completely organic and therefore much lighter, potentially reducing the overall weight of electronic circuits.

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301 fs to 150 fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8208;9 M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.</dc:description>

The hot-electron fast decay component of a-MoO3 decreases from 301 fs to 150 fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon-induced hot-electron transfer (PIHET) process from a-MoO3 to MO.

In addition, a-MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c-MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o-aminoazotoluene (o-AAT) is 10-9 M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a-MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation, Structure and Reactivity of a Beryllium(0) Complex with Mg&#948;+ &#822;&#822; Be&#948;&#713; Bond Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8208;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI* = HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8208;Be bond of 2.469(4) &#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8208;Be bond requires &#916;H = 69.6 kcal mol&#713;1 (cf. CpBe&#8208;BeCp 69.0 kcal mol&#713;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8208;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8 kcal mol&#713;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27 / BeCp* &#8208;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8208;23.7 ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8208;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8208;Be&#948;&#713; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8208;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8208;Be unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) Coupling to Access C(sp3)&#8208;Rich gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and the pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;&#8208;tertiary and C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can be easily obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming step.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Domino&#160;Effect Triggered by &#946;&#8208;alanine Cations Realized Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8208; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8208; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12 times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650 h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4%).</dc:description>

         <title>XAT&#8208;Catalysis for Intramolecular Biaryl Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical ipso substitution offers an alternative to organometallic approaches for biaryl synthesis, but usually requires stoichiometric reagents such as tributyltin hydride. Here, we demonstrate that visible light photoredox catalysis can be used for ipso&#8208;biaryl synthesis, via a halogen atom transfer (XAT) regime. Using amide substrates that promote ipso over unwanted ortho addition, we demonstrate smooth biaryl formation with no constraint on the electronic character of the migrating arene ring. The photoreaction can be combined in one operation to achieve a formal arylation of the inert aniline C&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Covalent Helical Ladder Polymers: The Dawn of a Tailorable Class of Chiral Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure and new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral&#8208;related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes with easily accessible alkenyl halides promoted by a chiral cobalt complex derived from a newly developed tridentate bisoxazolinephosphine is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a general approach that enable rapid construction of highly diversified enantioenriched allylic alcohols containing a 1,1&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and trisubstituted alkene as well as axial stereogenicity in up to 99% yield and 99:1 er without the need of preformation of alkenyl&#8211;metal reagents.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8208;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8208;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8208;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8208;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8208; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8208;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in determining photocatalytic reaction pathways, intermediate species, and product selectivity. However, research on ROS regulation in polymer photocatalysts is still in its early stages. Herein, we successfully achieved series of modulations to the skeleton of Pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based (Tetraethynylpyrene (TEPY)) conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) by altering the linkers (1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene (BE), 4,4'&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (IP), and 3,3'&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (BP)). Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that BE&#8208;TEPY exhibits a planar structure with minimal exciton binding energy, which favors exciton dissociation followed by charge transfer with adsorbed O2 to produce &#8226;O2&#8208;. Thus BE&#8208;TEPY shows optimal photocatalytic activity for phenylboronic acid oxidation and [3+2] cycloaddition. Conversely, the skeleton of BP&#8208;TEPY is significantly distorted. Its planar conjugation decreases, intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency increases, which makes it more prone for resonance energy transfer to generate 1O2. Therefore, BP&#8208;TEPY displays best photocatalytic activity in [4+2] cycloaddition and thioanisole oxidation. Both above reactant conversion and its product selectivity exceed 99%. This work systematically reveals the intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationship among the skeleton structure of CPPs, excitonic behavior, and selective generation of ROS, providing new insights for the rational design of highly efficient and selective CPPs photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Growth and Density Modulation of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8208;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8208;M&#8208;CeO2&#8208;X/rGO). It exhibited high activity in HER with an overpotential of 25 mV at 0.5 M H2SO4 and 33 mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90 hours at &#8722;100 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150 mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8208;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Azo Cathodes Enabled by N&#8208;Heteroatomic Substitution for Zinc Batteries with a Self&#8208;Charging Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active azo compounds are emerging as promising cathode materials due to their multi&#8208;electron redox capacity and fast redox response. However, their practical application is often limited by low output voltage and poor thermal stability. Herein, we use a heteroatomic substitution strategy to develop 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azopyridine. This modification results in a 350 mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291 Wh kg&#8722;1. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68 &#176;C to 112 &#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azopyridine forms metal&#8208;ligand complexes with Zn2+ ions, which further self&#8208;assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 60,000 cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self&#8208;charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self&#8208;powered aqueous systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Redox-active azo compounds are emerging as promising cathode materials due to their multi-electron redox capacity and fast redox response. However, their practical application is often limited by low output voltage and poor thermal stability. Herein, we use a heteroatomic substitution strategy to develop 4,4&#8217;-azopyridine. This modification results in a 350 mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291 Wh kg&#8722;1. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68 &#176;C to 112 &#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen-bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8217;-azopyridine forms metal-ligand complexes with Zn2+ ions, which further self-assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C) and an ultra-long lifespan of 60,000 cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self-charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self-powered aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Bridged Cyclobutanes by Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal Cycloadditions of Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates and Bicyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bridged cyclobutanes and sulfur heterocycles are currently under intense investigation as building blocks for pharmaceutical drug design. Two formal cycloaddition modes involving bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate derivatives were described to rapidly expand the chemical space of sulfur&#8208;containing bridged cyclobutanes. By using Ni(ClO4)2 as the catalyst, an uncommon higher&#8208;order (5+3) cycloaddition of BCBs with quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was achieved with broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric polar (5+3) cycloaddition of BCB with pyridazinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was accomplished. In contrast, pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates undergo an Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+3) reaction with BCBs to generate thia&#8208;norpinene products, which represent the initial instance of synthesizing 2&#8208;thiabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (thia&#8208;BCHeps) from BCBs. Moreover, we have successfully used this (3+3) protocol to rapidly prepare thia&#8208;BCHeps&#8208;substituted analogues of the bioactive molecule Pitofenone. Density functional theory (DFT) computations imply that kinetic factors govern the (5+3) cycloaddition reaction between BCB and quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate, whereas the (3+3) reaction involving pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates is under thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung&#8208;Enabled Divergent Dearomative Carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although dearomative functionalizations enable the direct conversion of flat aromatics into precious three&#8208;dimensional architectures, the case for simple arenes remains largely underdeveloped due to the high aromatic stabilization energy. We herein report a dearomative sequential addition of two nucleophiles to arene &#960;&#8208;bonds via umpolung of chromium&#8208;arene complexes. This mode enables divergent dearomative carbonylations of benzene derivatives by tolerating various nucleophiles in combination with alcohols or amines under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, thus providing modular access to functionalized esters or amides. The tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes as well as the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers further highlight the versatility of this dearomatization. Diverse late&#8208;stage modifications and derivatizations towards synthetically challenging and bioactive molecules reveal the synthetic utility. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments and intermediate tracking.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Zn2+&#160;Migration&#8208;Diffusion Behavior by Spontaneous Cascade Optimization Strategy for Long&#8208;Life and Low N/P Ratio Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parasitic side reactions and dendrite growth on zinc anodes are formidable issues causing limited lifetime of aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation&#8208;reconstruction properties is constructed in&#8208;situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well&#8208;soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor&#8208;soluble polymerized&#8208;4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower&#8208;like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de&#8208;solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000 h (1 mA cm&#8208;2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+&#8208;V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15 A g&#8208;1 maintains 72.2% capacity retention for 12000 cycles. Even better, the full cell demonstrates excellent performance of cumulative capacity of 2.33 Ah cm&#8208;2 at ultra&#8208;low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 0.6 and a high mass&#8208;loading (~17 mg cm&#8208;2). The spontaneous cascade optimization strategy provides novel path to achieve high&#8208;performance and practical ZIBs.</dc:description>

Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration-diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation-reconstruction properties is constructed in-situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor-soluble polymerized-4-acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower-like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de-solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration-diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000 h (1 mA cm-2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+-V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15 A g-1 maintains 72.2% capacity retention for 12000 cycles.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant "embossment&#8208;like" structured grain&#8208;boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain&#8208;boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (&#916;G ~ 0.20 eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol&#8208;targeted catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Silver Electrocatalysts for Selective and Stable Syngas Production from Reactive Carbon Capture Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50% at potentials more negative than &#8208;0.7 V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5 ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO:H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300oC contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8208;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>20.1% Certified Efficiency of Planar Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells by Spacer Cation Chain Length Engineering of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The planar triple&#8208;layer hole transport layer (HTL)&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have outstanding advantages of low cost and high stability, but are limited by low efficiency. The formation of a 3D/2D heterojunction has been widely proven to enhance device performance. However, the 2D perovskite possesses multiple critical properties associated with 3D perovskite, including defect passivation, energy level, and charge transport properties, all of which can impact device performance. It is challenging to find a powerful means to achieve comprehensive regulation and trade&#8208;off of these key properties. Herein, we propose a chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cations to achieve this goal. The results show that the 2D perovskite formed by short&#8208;chain alkylammonium cations primarily acts to passivate defects. With the increase in cation chain length, the 2D perovskite achieves a more matched energy level with 3D perovskite, enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and promoting charge separation. However, the further increase in chain length impedes the charge transport due to the insulativity of organic cations. Comprehensively, the 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium cations achieves the optimal balance of defect passivation, interface charge separation, and charge transport. The planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a new record efficiency of 20.40% (certified 20.1%).</dc:description>

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li metal is regarded as the "Holy Grail" in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000 h (20,000 cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40 C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68 s to provide high capacity of 151 mAh g&#8208;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrooted&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported metal catalyst with new enrooted&#8208;type metal&#8208;support interaction, where the Ir clusters atomically enrooted into the lattice of WO3 support, has been synthesized through a facile approach, achieving a stable metal&#8208;support interface and maximized exposure of metal active sites.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.

         <title>Chiral Teropyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the inaugural synthesis of a chiral teropyrene&#160;achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation catalyzed by InCl3, resulting in good yields. The product underwent thorough characterization using FT&#8208;Raman and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies, demonstrating a close agreement with calculated spectra. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unveiled a notable twist in the molecule's backbone, with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 51&#176;, consistent with computational predictions. Experimentally determined enantiomeric inversion barriers revealed a significant energy barrier of 23 kcal/mol, facilitating the isolation of enantiomers for analysis via circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopies. These findings mark significant strides in the synthesis and characterization of chiral teropyrenes, offering insights into their structural and spectroscopic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride&#8208; and Hydrosulfide&#8208;Bound 2Fe Complexes as Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of&#160;enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722;&#160;ligation to the iron&#160;bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact&#160;state of&#160;DdHydAB and&#160;CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans&#160;and Hinact&#160;states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans&#160;and Hinact&#160;states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;&#160;demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Antigen Delivery Controlled by an On&#8208;Demand Photorelease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To eliminate infected and cancerous cells, antigen processing and presentation play a pivotal role through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed on Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) molecules. Here, we developed a photostimulated antigen release system that enables the temporal inception of antigen flux. Simple and effective photocaging of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope, a representative high&#8208;affinity MHC I ligand, was provided by steric hindrance to block the recognition by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the peptide loading complex (PLC). In response to light, a heteronomous release of antigens and subsequent translocation in various scenarios is demonstrated, including a TAP&#8208;related ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporter reconstituted in liposomes and the native PLC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of human cells. The photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens opens new opportunities for a mechanistic analysis of the antigen translocation machinery and will help to provide insights into antigen processing pathways via an on&#8208;demand, subcellular pulse&#8208;chase release of antigens.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine tuning color through optical band structure and interfaces: Through anaerobic pyrolysis, generation of rare earth oxide&#8208;reduced carbon interfaces allows for tunability and convergence in color from optical band structure to structural evolution. Herein, we show Ho3+ ions which start pink in nature and undergo transitions in luminosity and chromaticity to black, illustrating the role of structure, composition, and processing conditions.







Abstract
Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized and in situ self&#8208;assembled to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity, and chromaticity were investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transition states relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor band gap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.

         <title>Revealing Na+&#8208;coordination induced Failure Mechanism of Metal Sulfide Anode for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination with Na+ in electrolyte induces excessive dissolution and electric field driven delocalization of Na2S, causing solo oxidations of discharge products, which is revealed as the cycling failure mechanism for MS anode. Therefore, the coordination regulation of Na2S is proposed as an effective strategy.







Abstract
Metal sulfide (MS) is regarded as a promising candidate of the anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) with ideal capacity and low cost, yet still suffers from the inferior cycling stability and voltage degradation. Herein, the coordination relationship between the discharge product Na2S with the Na+ (NaPF6) in the electrolyte, is revealed as the root cause for the cycling failure of MS. Na+&#8208;coordination effect assistants the dissolution of Na2S, further delocalizing Na2S from the reaction interface under the function of electric field, which leads to the solo oxidation of the discharge product element metal without the participation of Na2S. Besides, the higher highest occupied molecular orbital of Na2S suggest the facilitated Na2S solo oxidation to produce sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Based on these, lowering the Na+ concentration of the electrolyte is proposed as a potential improvement strategy to change the coordination environment of Na2S, suppressing the side reactions of the solo&#8208;oxidation of element metal and Na2S. Consequently, the enhanced conversion reaction reversibility and prolonged cycle life are achieved. This work renders in&#8208;depth perception of failure mechanism and inspiration for realizing advanced conversion&#8208;type anode.

         <title>Genuine carbene versus carbene&#8208;like reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes which are sometime too elusive for direct detection, have been inferred through in&#8208;situ trapping experiments. Using the first spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), this study questions whether &#8220;carbene&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity is genuine evidence of carbene formation.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are not always isolable and often even elude direct detection. When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by in situ trapping experiments. However, is carbene&#8208;like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation? Herein, using the first example of a spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), we cast doubt on the most common carbene trapping reactions as sufficient proof of carbene formation.

         <title>Ideal Cage&#8208;like Pores for Molecular Sieving of Butane Isomers with High Purity and Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework with small windows and large cavities exhibit not only exclusive adsorption for iso&#8208;C4H10 but also record&#8208;high adsorption for n&#8208;C4H10. High&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) and n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) with record productivities can be obtained respectively from separation and desorption process.







Abstract
n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high&#8208;purity n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 in one&#8208;step separation process, developing iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion adsorbents with high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage&#8208;like MOF (SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller n&#8208;C4H10 enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of n&#8208;C4H10 simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA not only completely excludes iso&#8208;C4H10 in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity of 94.2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;kPa and 298&#8197;K, which is the highest value among iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion&#8208;type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has excellent n/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation performance and can achieve a record&#8208;high productivity of iso&#8208;C4H10 (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with high purity (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.

Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX-Cu-TPA has excellent &lt;i&gt;n/iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance and can achieve a record-high productivity of &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with high purity (&amp;gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX-Cu-TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX-Cu-TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are synthesized with uniform chiral catalytic sites on the pore walls, exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance in enantioselective electrophilic amination reactions with good stability and recyclability.







Abstract
The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs) are prepared based on covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale production can be achieved at low cost, alongside excellent solution processibility, paving the way to diverse applications. Remarkably, the CPOFs exhibit exceptionally high NH3 uptake capacities, indicating their great potential toward NH3 capture.







Abstract
A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.

         <title>Building Co16&#8208;N3&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;MOF to Expand Design Parameters for MOF Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual small molecules auxiliary strategy was proposed to construct the first high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture, where the N3&#8722; supplies a new modification site to precisely bond strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction for cooperatively boosting photocatalysis.







Abstract
The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi&#8208;functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC with visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing capacity. Remarkably, the N3&#8722; molecule in hexadecameric cobalt azide SBU offers novel modification sites to precise bonding of strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction. The resulting Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC exhibits extremely high performance for oxidative coupling benzylamine (~100&#8201;% yield) via both energy and electron transfer processes, which is much superior to that of Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (31.5&#8201;%) and Carboxyl @Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (37.5&#8201;%). Systematic investigations reveal that the advantages of Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC in dual light&#8208;absorbing channels, robust bonding between Bodipy/Co16 clusters and efficient electron&#8208;hole separation can greatly boost photosynthesis. This work provides an ideal molecular platform for synergy between photosensitizing MOFs and chromophores by constructing high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based SBUs with surface&#8208;modifiable small molecules.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) was synthesized as an efficient acid OER catalyst. Grain boundaries effectively regulated the electronic structure of the active site and optimized the adsorption behavior of intermediates, but also stabilized the active site structure by preventing Ru dissolution and converting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).







Abstract
RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Inverse Hydride Shuttle Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient and stereoselective synthesis of alkaloid frameworks. We present a unique Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to enable the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.







Abstract
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Hetero&#8208;Phase Nanostructure Photocatalysts with Molecular&#8208;Scale Tunable Energy Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via an SBU regulating strategy, MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase (COK/MIL&#8208;125) was successfully prepared and employed in photocatalysis. This novel hetero&#8208;phase not only possesses periodic channel structures, but also exhibits the capacity of molecular&#8208;scale adjustment on energy levels.







Abstract
As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;Scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>A Fluorinated Chaperone Gives X&#8208;ray Crystal Structures of Acyclic Natural Product Derivatives up to 338 Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining X&#8208;ray crystal structures of compounds with long flexible chains that are liquids at room temperature is difficult. A new crystallization chaperone is reported that encapsulates such compounds and provides crystallographic images that cannot be obtained otherwise thus far.







Abstract
Crystallizing molecules with long flexible chains is a challenge, making it difficult to perform X&#8208;ray crystallography. Chaperones can assist in the crystallization of compounds that do not crystallize by themselves by producing solvate crystals that contain the analyte in their three&#8208;dimensional lattices. Among the most versatile chaperones for liquid analytes are tetraaryladamantanes (TAAs), but the size of the compounds that can be encapsulated is limited, and attempts to surpass this limit with known TAAs were unsuccessful. Here we report that 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)adamantane (TFM) is a crystallization chaperone for acyclic molecules up to the molecular weight of phytyl acetate (338&#8197;g/mol). Encapsulation of such a large acyclic compound was achieved when the analyte was esterified and when a two&#8208;step temperature protocol was used for crystallization. Exploratory work indicates that a drop to &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C allows for encapsulation of squalene (Mr 411&#8197;g/mol), albeit with positional disorder of the analyte. Our X&#8208;ray crystal structures of solvates with flexible analytes shed light on how crystalline order can be imposed on large acyclic analytes. The new, fluorinated TAA gives access to crystal structures that were inaccessible thus far.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Therapy, Photothermal Therapy, Cuproptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed bioorthogonal Cu single atom nanozyme (CuSACO) for specifically tumor&#8208;targeting and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided tumor multifunctional therapy including high&#8208;efficiency multienzyme catalytic activities (catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), peroxidase (POD)), photothermal therapy (PTT), cuproptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;based immunotherapy, which effectively curb the growth, metastasis and recurrence of tumors.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with atomically dispersed active sites are potential substitutes for natural enzymes. A systematic study of its multiple functions can in&#8208;depth understand SAzymes's nature, which remains elusive. Here, we develop a novel ultrafast synthesis of sputtered SAzymes by in situ bombarding&#8208;embedding technique. Using this method, sputtered copper (Cu) SAzymes (CuSA) is developed with unreported unique planar Cu&#8208;C3 coordinated configuration. To enhance the tumor&#8208;specific targeting, we employ a bioorthogonal approach to engineer CuSA, denoted as CuSACO. CuSACO not only exhibits minimal off&#8208;target toxicity but also possesses exceptional ultrahigh catalase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;like multienzyme activities, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation for effective tumor destruction. Surprisingly, CuSACO can release Cu ions in the presence of glutathione (GSH) to induce cuproptosis, enhancing the tumor treatment efficacy. Notably, CuSACO&#8242;s remarkable photothermal properties enables precise photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors. This, combined with nanozyme catalytic activities, cuproptosis and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of orthotopic breast tumors and gliomas, and lung metastasis. Our research highlights the potential of CuSACO as an innovative strategy to utilize multiple mechanism to enhance tumor therapeutic efficacy, broadening the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;like behavior and physiological mechanism of action of SAzymes.

         <title>Spontaneous &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Ketones by Gaseous CO2 at the Air&#8208;water Interface of Aqueous Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged aqueous microdroplets facilitate carboxylation at &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H position of ketones by gaseous CO2 at the air&#8211;water Interface.







Abstract
We present a catalyst&#8208;free route for the reduction of carbon dioxide integrated with the formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond at the air/water interface of negatively charged aqueous microdroplets, at ambient temperature. The reactions proceed through carbanion generation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of a ketone followed by nucleophilic addition to CO2. Online mass spectrometry reveals that the product is an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid. Several factors, such as the concentration of the reagents, pressure of CO2 gas, and distance traveled by the droplets, control the kinetics of the reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that water in the microdroplets facilitates this unusual chemistry. Furthermore, such a microdroplet strategy has been extended to seven different ketones. This work demonstrates a green pathway for the reduction of CO2 to useful carboxylated organic products.

Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.

         <title>A H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery simultaneously integrates the power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. It can convert the chemical energy of H2O2 to electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. Benefiting from the ultrafast energy conversion rate, the battery exhibits extremely short self&#8208;charging time and realizes the continuous long&#8208;term energy supply.







Abstract
Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7&#8197;V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60&#8197;seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self&#8208;charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single&#8208;flow battery of 7.06&#8197;Ah to extend the long&#8208;term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self&#8208;charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self&#8208;charging power systems for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Bridging Atom Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Activation in a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. This variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation.







Abstract
Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites. Herein, we show an example that tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation. As a result, exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation performance was achieved with T25(Temperature for 25&#8201;% conversion)=35&#8201;&#176;C and T100 (Temperature for 100&#8201;% conversion)=150&#8201;&#176;C, which stands out from existing MOF&#8208;based catalysts and even rivals many noble metal catalysts. This work provides a guidance for the rational design of catalysts for efficient oxygen activation for an oxidation reaction.

         <title>Chemoselective Proteomics, Zinc Fingers, and a Zinc(II) Model for H2S Mediated Persulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persulfidation by H2S is a key modification of proteins. Using persulfide specific proteomics, cysteine rich zinc finger (ZF) proteins were found to be targets of persulfidation. The reaction of H2S with ZFs was evaluated using a series of ZFs and a small molecule ZnII coordination complex that mimics the ZF site. Persulfidation by H2S occurred in an O2 dependent manner, with the zinc acting as a conduit for electron transfer and S&#8722;S bond formation.







Abstract
The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be involved in the post&#8208;translational modification of cysteine residues to produce reactive persulfides. A persulfide&#8208;specific chemoselective proteomics approach with mammalian cells has identified a broad range of zinc finger (ZF) proteins as targets of persulfidation. Parallel studies with isolated ZFs show that persulfidation is mediated by ZnII, O2, and H2S, with intermediates involving oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based radicals detected by mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopies. A small molecule ZnII complex exhibits analogous reactivity with H2S and O2, giving a persulfidated product. These data show that ZnII is not just a biological structural element, but also plays a critical role in mediating H2S&#8208;dependent persulfidation. ZF persulfidation appears to be a general post&#8208;translational modification and a possible conduit for H2S signaling. This work has implications for our understanding of H2S&#8208;mediated signaling and the regulation of ZFs in cellular physiology and development.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8211;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8211;C over C&#8211;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs)&#160;are&#160;largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor&#160;primary solvation sheath&#160;and inner&#8208;Helmholtz&#160;configurations for robust zinc anode.&#160;Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation&#160;process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O&#160;with charge carriers through&#160;relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+.&#160;Thus, interfacial&#160;side reactions&#160;can be&#160;suppressed&#160;through a shielding effect.&#160;Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons&#160;of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial&#160;affinity of metallic&#160;zinc, associated with exclusion&#160;of neighboring&#160;water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800 hours&#160;at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2&#160;for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 4 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 mAh cm&#8208;2&#160;for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10&#160;cell maintains 80.3% of initial discharge capacity after 3000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1&#160;and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Dissolution of Active Sites in 80 &#176;C Alkaline Water Electrolysis by Oxyanion Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80 &#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe&#8208;based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;LDH active sites at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25&#8208;fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Variant&#8208;Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte without Phase Separation for Low&#8208;Temperature Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases.Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5 V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low-temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual-ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant-localized high-concentration solvation structure for universal low-temperature electrolytes (&#957;-LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak-solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;-LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak-solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+-solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases.Thus, the &#957;-LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high-voltage stability of &amp;gt;5.5 V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;-LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long-term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7% and 51.6 %, at -40 oC and -60 oC, respectively, indicating great potential for low- and&#160;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration,emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8208;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8208;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8208;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing narrow bandgap acceptors that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and strong crystallinity is a highly effective, yet challenging, approach to reducing non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#8710;Enr) and boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have successfully designed and synthesized an A&#8208;D&#8208;A type fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, named DM&#8208;F, which features a planar molecular backbone adorned with bulky three&#8208;dimensional camphane side groups at its central core. These bulky substituents effectively hinder the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of the acceptors, promoting the formation of more J&#8208;aggregates and notably elevating the PLQY of the acceptor in the film. As anticipated, DM&#8208;F showcases pronounced near&#8208;infrared absorption coupled with impressive crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) leveraging DM&#8208;F exhibit a high EQEEL value and remarkably low &#8710;Enr of 0.137 eV&#8208;currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM&#8208;F has reached 16.16% and 20.09%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow bandgap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#8710;Enr and improve the PCE of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic Deposition&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Thin Glass MOF Films for High&#8208;Performance Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional methods that lead to glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, the proposed cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted approach can produce glass MOF films with a thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m. The fabricated thin glass ZIF&#8208;62 film shows a record&#8208;high CO2 permeance without compromising the selectivity in CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations.







Abstract
Glass metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be fabricated from their crystalline counterparts through a melt&#8208;quenching process and are prospective candidates for gas separation because of the elimination of the grain boundaries in crystalline MOF films. However, current techniques are limited to producing glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, which leads to ultralow gas permeances. Here, we report a novel cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted synthesis of glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness as low as ~1&#8197;&#956;m. Electrochemical analyses and deposition experiments suggest that the cathodic deposition can lead to pure crystalline ZIF&#8208;62 films with a controllable thickness of ~2&#8197;&#956;m to ~15&#8197;&#956;m. Accordingly, glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness of ~1&#8197;&#956;m to ~10&#8197;&#956;m can be obtained after a thermal treatment. The fabricated defect&#8208;free glass ZIF&#8208;62 film measuring 2&#8197;&#956;m in thickness shows a remarkable CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 31.4 and 33.4, respectively, with a CO2 permeance which is over 30 times higher than the best&#8208;performing glass ZIF&#8208;62 films in literature.

         <title>Adhesion Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Biobased Microgels for Controlled Delivery of Pesticides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pectin microgels with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) are introduced as a biobased pesticide delivery system. Using Cu2+, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevent grapevine downy mildew, matching commercial pesticides. We developed biadhesive anchor peptides that self&#8208;assemble on pectin microgels and ensure tight leaf binding, providing rain resistance and prolonged fungicidal activity. P&#8208;MAPs easily degrade with natural enzymes, minimizing environmental impact.







Abstract
Widespread use of plant protection agents in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using copper as the active ingredient, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi&#8208;field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P&#8208;MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long&#8208;term impact on the environment.

         <title>Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox&#8208;Active Cationic Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of ion&#8208;exchange and redox sites, a bifunctional cationic polymeric materials tailored for iodate decontamination showcases unprecedented adsorption capacity, extremely rapid adsorption kinetics, and outstanding ion&#8208;selective performances.







Abstract
As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO3&#8722;) through ion exchange or hard acid&#8208;hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox&#8208;active cationic polymer network (SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6, [C9H10O2N5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl]n) by merging guanidino groups with ion&#8208;exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896&#8197;mg/g for IO3&#8722;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0&#8197;mg/g) or ion exchange (232&#8197;mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO3&#8722; in the presence of high concentrations of SO42&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep&#8208;removal performance for low IO3&#8722; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO3&#8722; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.

     alt="Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox-Active Cationic Polymer Network"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combination of ion-exchange and redox sites, a bifunctional cationic polymeric materials tailored for iodate decontamination showcases unprecedented adsorption capacity, extremely rapid adsorption kinetics, and outstanding ion-selective performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) through ion exchange or hard acid-hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox-active cationic polymer network (SCU-CPN-6, [C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) by merging guanidino groups with ion-exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU-CPN-6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896&#8197;mg/g for IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0&#8197;mg/g) or ion exchange (232&#8197;mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1+1&amp;gt;2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU-CPN-6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of high concentrations of SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep-removal performance for low IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery, Structure, and Engineering of a cis&#8208;Geranylfarnesyl Diphosphate Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) was discovered from Streptomyces clavuligerus. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ScGFPPS catalyzed the condensation of DMAPP, GPP, and FPP with IPP to yield six cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Structural variances between ScGFPPS and NNPS facilitated the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS to achieve high product specificity.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Prenyltransferases (cis&#8208;PTs) catalyze the sequential head&#8208;to&#8208;tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed E&#8211;Z prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing cis&#8208;C25 prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids, including three C25 and three C20 variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all&#8208;cis&#8208;C20 polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of cis&#8208;PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in cis&#8208;PTs engineering.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Coordination Foldamer&#8208;Based Polymer Network: from Molecular Spring to Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks with high&#8208;density molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination foldamers as monomer. This endows the materials with excellent energy dissipation and elasticity through folding and unfolding of foldamer. With increasing number of repeating units in the foldamer, the corresponding polymer network shows better mechanical performance as well as shape memory feature.







Abstract
Foldamer is a scaled&#8208;down version of coil spring, which can absorb and release energy by conformational change. Here, polymer networks with high density of molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based foldamers as the monomer. The coiling of the foldamer is controlled by oligo(urea) ligands coordinating to chloride ions; subsequently, the folding and unfolding of foldamer conformations endow the polymer network with excellent energy dissipation and toughness. The mechanical performance of the corresponding polymer networks shows a dramatic increase from P&#8208;L2UCl (non&#8208;folding), to P&#8208;L4UCl (a full turn), and then to P&#8208;L6UCl (1.5 turns), in terms of strength (2.62&#8197;MPa; 14.26&#8197;MPa; 22.93&#8197;MPa), elongation at break (70&#8201;%; 325&#8201;%; 352&#8201;%), Young's modulus (2.69&#8197;MPa; 63.61&#8197;MPa; 141.50&#8197;MPa), and toughness (1.12&#8197;MJ/m3; 21.39&#8197;MJ/m3; 49.62&#8197;MJ/m3), respectively, which is also better than those without anion centers and the non&#8208;foldamer based counterparts. Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks. Thus, an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based materials is presented.

         <title>Lithium Pre&#8208;Storage Enables High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Stable Lithium&#8208;Enriched Silicon/Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from water&#8208;sensitive pre&#8208;lithiated silicon&#8208;based anodes, a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material is designed by lithium pre&#8208;storage. This is a new prelithiation strategy employing nano&#8208;drilled graphite with surficial lithium functional groups, which allow for the extraction of lithium to form a special unit, exhibiting both high initial Coulombic efficiency and excellent stability in air and water.







Abstract
Application of silicon&#8208;based anodes is significantly challenged by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cyclability. Traditional pre&#8208;lithiation reagents often pose safety concerns due to their unstable chemical nature. Achieving a balance between water&#8208;stability and high ICE in prelithiated silicon is a critical issue. Here, we present a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material with an ultra&#8208;high ICE of &#8805;110&#8201;% through a high&#8208;stable lithium pre&#8208;storage methodology. Lithium pre&#8208;storage prepared a nano&#8208;drilled graphite material with surficial lithium functional groups, which can form chemical bonds with adjacent silicon during high&#8208;temperature sintering. This results in an unexpected O&#8722;Li&#8722;Si interaction, leading to in situ pre&#8208;lithiation of silicon nanoparticles and providing high stability in air and water. Additionally, the lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite materials impart a combination of high ICE, high specific capacity (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long cycling stability (&gt;400 cycles). This study opens up a promising avenue for highly air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable silicon anode prelithiation methods.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle&#8208;based cocrystal system that undergoes dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism to alkyl ketones. The unique vapochromic behavior was mainly due to different solid&#8208;state superstructures and noncovalent interactions from the homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.

Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene-based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self-sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length-selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor-induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo- or heterochiral self-sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid-state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self-sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self-sorting at the solid-vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosensor Strip for Rapid On&#8208;site Assessment of Levodopa Pharmacokinetics along with Motor Performance in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to monitor L&#8208;Dopa levels on the spot reliably, rapidly, and inexpensively in outpatient settings, is demonstrated using disposable biosensor strips. The resulting hand&#8208;held calibration&#8208;free L&#8208;Dopameter system offers near real&#8208;time tracking of temporal L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles in Parkinson patients following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration. Such L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles correlate closely with the corresponding motor response trends.







Abstract
While levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the primary treatment for alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD), its efficacy is hindered by challenges such as a short half&#8208;life and inconsistent plasma levels. As PD progresses, the rising need for increased and more frequent L&#8208;Dopa doses coupled with symptom fluctuations and dyskinesias underscores the urgency for improved comprehension of the interplay between L&#8208;Dopa levels and PD motor symptoms. Addressing this critical need, we present a decentralized testing method using a disposable biosensor strip and a universal slope (U&#8208;slope) calibration&#8208;free approach. This enables reliable, rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective decentralized L&#8208;Dopa measurements from capillary blood. A pilot study with PD persons demonstrates the ability to monitor real&#8208;time L&#8208;Dopa pharmacokinetics from fingerstick blood after oral L&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Carbidopa (C&#8211;Dopa) tablet administration. Correlating capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with PD motor scores revealed a well&#8208;defined inverse correlation with temporal motor fluctuations. We compared the resulting dynamic capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with plasma L&#8208;Dopa levels using the traditional but clinically impractical high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography technique. By providing timely feedback on a proper L&#8208;Dopa dosing regimen in a decentralized and rapid fashion, this new biosensing platform will facilitate tailored optimal L&#8208;Dopa dosing, towards improving symptom management and enhancing health&#8208;related quality of life.

         <title>Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine&#8208;appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV&#8208;10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine&#8208;appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti2Ca2 clusters. The combination of hard (Ti4+) and soft (Ca2+) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV&#8208;10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV&#8208;10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO2 diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.

         <title>Controlled Biocatalytic Synthesis of a Metal Nanoparticle&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid: Demonstration for Catalytic H2&#8208;driven NADH Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions, small (&lt;10&#8197;nm), spherical, monodisperse metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesised using an NAD+ reductase enzyme as reductant and stabilizer, forming Au NPs and Au@Pt (core&#8208;shell) NPs. The enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids demonstrated promising activity as a H2&#8208;driven NADH cofactor recycling system, coupled with an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the preparation of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrids of NAD+ reductase with biocatalytically&#8208;synthesised small gold nanoparticles (NPs, &lt;10&#8197;nm) and core&#8208;shell gold&#8208;platinum NPs for tandem catalysis. Despite the variety of methods available for NP synthesis, there remains a need for more sustainable strategies which also give precise control over the shape and size of the metal NPs for applications in catalysis, biomedical devices, and electronics. We demonstrate facile biosynthesis of spherical, highly uniform, gold NPs under mild conditions using an isolated enzyme moiety, an NAD+ reductase, to reduce metal salts while oxidising a nicotinamide&#8208;containing cofactor. By subsequently introducing platinum salts, we show that core&#8208;shell Au@Pt NPs can then be formed. Catalytic function of these enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids was demonstrated for H2&#8208;driven NADH recycling to support enantioselective ketone reduction by an NADH&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly photostable and polarity&#8208;sensitive labeling agent for the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been developed, enabling visualization of mitochondrial cristae using STED microscopy. In combination with FLIM, it also allows the analysis of lipid heterogeneity at the single mitochondrion level. Time&#8208;lapse FLIM observations revealed that mitochondrial swelling is preceded by an increase in the IMM order resulting from lipid peroxidation.







Abstract
The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) undergoes dynamic morphological changes, which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions as well as cell survival. As the dynamics of the membrane are governed by its lipid components, a fluorescent probe that can sense spatiotemporal alterations in the lipid properties of the IMM over long periods of time is required to understand mitochondrial physiological functions in detail. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive IMM&#8208;labeling reagent with excellent photostability and sensitivity to its environment, which enables the visualization of the IMM ultrastructure using super&#8208;resolution microscopy as well as of the lipid heterogeneity based on the fluorescence lifetime at the single mitochondrion level. Combining the probe and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) showed that peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the IMM by reactive oxygen species caused an increase in the membrane order, which took place prior to mitochondrial swelling.

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y&#8208;stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) in the form of both well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystals (polarization&#8208;resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high&#8208;pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D2O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y3+&#8208;doping, showing superior activity for low&#8208;temperature water dissociation.







Abstract
The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.

&lt;p&gt;We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y-stabilized ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (YSZ) in the form of both well-defined single-crystals (polarization-resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high-pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low-coordinated Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doping, showing superior activity for low-temperature water dissociation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface structure and chemical properties of Y-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well-controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization-resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y-doped ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red-shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under-coordinated Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in the vicinity of doping-induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ-based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Boosted Hydronium Intercalation: A Paradigm Shift in Aluminum&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets are rich in oxygen defects, which tilt the adsorption effect of Al3+ and effectively inhibit further insertion/diffusion of Al3+. This phenomenon leaves space for H3O+ insertion, allowing it to insert into the lattice smoothly.







Abstract
In aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the insertion/extraction chemistry of Al3+ often leads to poor kinetics, whereas the rapid diffusion kinetics of hydronium ions (H3O+) may offer the solution. However, the presence of considerable Al3+ in the electrolyte hinders the insertion reaction of H3O+. Herein, we report how oxygen&#8208;deficient &#945;&#8208;MoO3 nanosheets unlock selective H3O+ insertion in a mild aluminum&#8208;ion electrolyte. The abundant oxygen defects impede the insertion of Al3+ due to excessively strong adsorption, while allowing H3O+ to be inserted/diffused through the Grotthuss proton conduction mechanism. This research advances our understanding of the mechanism behind selective H3O+ insertion in mild electrolytes.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Ni/Ni(OH)2 Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Boosts Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Ampere&#8208;Level Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of Ni core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell is fabricated through one&#8208;step electrodeposition to achieve ampere&#8208;level electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia with high efficiency. Meanwhile, it can be used to electrocatalytically upgrade methanol to formate, which decreases the energy efficiency of ammonia production in a two&#8208;electrode system. This is a favorable advancement for ammonia energy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia provides a green alternate to the Haber&#8211;Bosch method, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics and a low yield rate. The nitrate reduction follows a tandem reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent nitrite hydrogenation to generate ammonia, and the ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) is limited by the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we design a heterostructure catalyst to remedy the above issues, which consists of Ni nanosphere core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell (Ni/Ni(OH)2). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals Ni and Ni(OH)2 are interconvertible according to the applied potential, facilitating the cascade nitrate reduction synergistically. Consequently, it attains superior electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance with an ammonia FE of 98.50&#8201;% and a current density of 0.934&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.476&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and exhibits an average ammonia yield rate of 84.74&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 during the 102&#8208;hour stability test, which is highly superior to the reported catalysts tested under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations corroborate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the tandem reaction of nitrate reduction. Moreover, the Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also possesses good capability for methanol oxidation and thus is used to establish a system coupling with nitrate reduction.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Electric Field&#8208;Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 Heterostructure for High&#8208;Efficiency Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 (UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5) heterostructure with optimized interfacial electric field (IEF) is designed and fabricated for high&#8208;efficiency potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) anodes. The IEF intensity in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 is 3.65&#8197;times that of pure FeSe/Fe3Se4. Intriguingly, this uniform doping strategy has strong generality in improving IEF strength and PIB performance. As expected, amorphous carbon&#8208;coated UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (95.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
The interfacial electric field (IEF) in the heterostructure can accelerate electron transport and ion migration, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Nevertheless, the quantification and modulation of the IEF for high&#8208;efficiency PIB anodes currently remains a blank slate. Herein, we achieve for the first time the quantification and tuning of IEF via amorphous carbon&#8208;coated undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (denoted UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C) for efficient potassium storage. Co doping can increase the IEF in FeSe/Fe3Se4, thereby improving the electron transport, promoting the potassium adsorption capacity, and lowering the diffusion barrier. As expected, the IEF magnitude in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C is experimentally quantified as 62.84&#8197;mV, which is 3.65&#8197;times larger than that of amorphous carbon&#8208;coated FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (Fe4Se5/C). Benefiting from the strong IEF, UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C as a PIB anode exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle lifespan (capacity retention of 95.1&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Furthermore, this undifferentiated doping strategy can universally regulate the IEF magnitude in CoSe2/Co9Se8 and FeS2/Fe7S8 heterostructures. This work can provide fundamental insights into the design of advanced PIB electrodes.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization&#8208;Driven Template Autocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we elucidate the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by trans&#8208;amides in thermally responsive crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis. The H&#8208;bonds not only endow the product with template ability but can also thermally activate or inhibit autocatalysis by reversibly changing amide conformations. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.







Abstract
Autocatalysis has been recognized to be involved in the emergence of life and intrinsic to biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent&#8208;free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by amides in crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness.

     alt="The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization-Driven Template Autocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we elucidate the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by trans-amides in thermally responsive crystallization-driven template autocatalysis. The H-bonds not only endow the product with template ability but can also thermally activate or inhibit autocatalysis by reversibly changing amide conformations. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H-bonding interactions in artificial self-replicators.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocatalysis has been recognized to be involved in the emergence of life and intrinsic to biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent-free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by amides in crystallization-driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness. We found that the thermal-induced &lt;i&gt;cis-trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of amides possibly affects the H-bonding-mediated template ability of products for autocatalytic transformation. As a result, CDTA can be reversibly inhibited and activated by tuning the reaction temperatures. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H-bonding interactions in artificial self-replicators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate interconvertible system composed of four chiral species of diphane has been studied. The complex structural changes can be dissected into two pathways: a slow C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configurational interconversion and a rapid P&#8208; to M&#8208;conformational transition. As the latter is much faster than the former, the latter can be further deconvolved into two individual conformational interchanges: (P)&#8208;C3&#8596;(M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1&#8596;(M)&#8208;C1.







Abstract
Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for the C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion, while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As kobs

         <title>Discovery of a Plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Inhibitor Possessing Isoform Selectivity and In Planta Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins has been developed. The inhibitor displayed isoform selectivity through covalent and allosteric inhibitory action. Inhibitor&#8208;driven stomatal closing on Arabidopsis leaves was also investigated. This inhibitor provides new insight into the modulation of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and the application to plant growth regulation.







Abstract
Synthetic modulators of plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Herein, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate over Phosphate&#8208;Modified In: Water Activation and Active Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can act as anchoring sites to enrich K+(H2O)n close to the In active sites in the double layer and activate K+(H2O)n to generate H+. Besides, (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can also modulate the electronic structure of the In active sites, resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption. Both of which shall facilitate the electrochemical CO2RR to form formate.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified oxide&#8208;derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1&#8201;% at a partial current density of ~200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cathodic potential of &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra&#8208;cluster and inter&#8208;cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.







Abstract
Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA=4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.

     alt="Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra-cluster and inter-cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra- and inter-luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting-edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra-cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; (pMBA=4-mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter-cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well-designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter-cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; at the molecular level to enhance intra-cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Like Silicone Nanofilaments@Montmorillonite Nanofillers of PEO&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries with Wide Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. The SSLMBs with the CSEs show high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs&#8217; limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, 30&#8201;&#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3&#8197;V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50&#8201;&#176;C to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.

         <dc:description>
THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

         <dc:description>
The energy density of aqueous zinc ion batteries is greatly affected by the low energy density, low potential and low power density of the cathode material. In their Research Article (e202403187), Xijin Xu, Huiqiao Li et&#8197;al. report a method to activate and stabilize a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction between I&#8722; and I+ by introducing Br&#8722; as a mediator, which greatly promotes the capacity and effectively suppresses iodine shuttling for high cycling stability.

The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision were reported by Lingwen Liao, Jun Yang, and Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402565). The as&#8208;obtained Pt23 nanoclusters via a mixture ligand protecting strategy exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, without requiring calcination or other treatments. An excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was also revealed, indicating great potential for applications of such materials.

The dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation renders JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP a shrinkage of the 1D channels in the c&#8208;axis direction, allowing complete exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while maintaining high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98&#8201;% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5&#8201;% purity and close to 90&#8201;% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8722;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) has been prepared by replacing &#8722;Br in Ti3C2Br2 with gas&#8208;phase P. Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) powder is directly obtained and the atomic content of P reaches the theoretical atomic percentage content. Compared to MXene Ti3C2Br2 with the &#8722;Br functional groups, the areal capacitance of Ti3C2PBrx with &#8722;P functional groups has increased by about 3.6&#8197;times at scan rates of 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate has not decreased after 10000&#8197;cycles. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.







Abstract
MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8722;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8722;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8722;Br is replaced with &#8722;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). At a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 10000&#8197;cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts loaded on ultrathin CdS nanosheets (Ru1/CdS), which efficiently catalyze biomass&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to produce amino acids under visible light irradiation. The optimal system predominates the conventional thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems in terms of conversion, selectivity, yield, and amino acid formation rates.







Abstract
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#8197;molAla&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 1.7&#8197;times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8722;H bond dissociation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8722;OH and CH3&#8722;CH&#8722;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cell.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.

     alt="The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen-Bond-Rich Gel-State Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen-bond acceptors to gel-state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel-state lithium metal pouch cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gel-state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self-healing abilities and high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen-bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen-bond acceptors to hydrogen-bond-rich gel-state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen-bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen-bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel-state-based LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematically experimental and computational investigation on the catalytic performances of the bifunctional and binary organoborane catalysts are performed to explore the origination of the catalytic differences in terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride, where gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers and tapered diblock terpolymers were afforded respectively.







Abstract
Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.

         <title>Electrophilic Hydrosilylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes Derived from Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;Electron Pt(II) germyl complexes bearing small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) catalyze the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrosilylation (anti SiH bond addition) of electron&#8208;rich alkenes derived from enamines, thus producing &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. On the contrary, using bulkier NHC ligands promotes the competitive silylative dehydrocoupling process. Mechanistic studies point to unprecedented outer&#8208;sphere Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformations.







Abstract
The low&#8208;electron count, air&#8208;stable, platinum complexes [Pt(ItBu&#8217;)(ItBu)][BArF] (C1) (ItBu=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C2) (ItBuiPr=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;iso&#8208;propylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C3), [Pt(GePh3)(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C4), [Pt(GePh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C5) and [Pt(GeEt)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C6) (ItBuMe=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are efficient catalysts (particularly the germyl derivatives) in both the silylative dehydrocoupling and hydrosilylation of electron rich alkenes derived from enamines. The steric hindrance exerted by the NHC ligand plays an important role in the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, bulky ligands are selective towards the silylative dehydrocoupling process whereas less sterically hindered promote the selective hydrosilylation reaction. The latter is, in addition, regioselective towards the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of both internal and terminal enamines, leading to &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. Moreover, the syn stereochemistry of the amino and silyl groups implies an anti Si&#8722;H bond addition across the double bond. All these facts point to a mechanistic picture that, according to experimental and computational studies, involves a non&#8208;classical hydrosilylation process through an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in which a formal nucleophilic addition of the enamine to the silicon atom of a platinum &#963;&#8208;SiH complex is the key step. This is in sharp contrast with the classical Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism prevalent in platinum chemistry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe&#8208;SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.







Abstract
Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro&#8208;oxidative ring&#8208;opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe&#8208;SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram&#8208;scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.
