         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0 Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and challenge. In this study, synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fashion is presented. In combination with triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for photosynthesis of H2O2 with a production rate of 11733 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8208;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Intermediate Adsorption over PdM (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Bimetallene for Boosted Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NO3RR) is a promising and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for ammonia production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the eight&#8208;electron transfer process and poor mechanistic understanding strongly impedes its application. To unveil the internal laws, herein, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8208;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants break the electronic balance and upshift its d&#8208;band center, thus optimizing intermediates adsorption. The anisotropic electronic characteristics of these transition metals make the NO3RR activity in the order of PdCu &gt; PdCo &#8776; PdFe &gt; PdNi &gt; Pd, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 295 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1 along with Faradaic efficiency of 90.9% is achieved in neutral electrolyte on PdCu bimetallene. Detailed studies further reveal that the moderate N&#8208;species (*NO3 and *NO2) adsorption ability, enhanced *NO activation, and reduced HER activity facilitate the NH3 production. We believe our results will give a systematic guidance to the future design of NO3RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Rhenium Atomically Dispersed on Indium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven photoreduction of CO2 is promising in alleviating environment burden, but suffers from low efficiency and over&#8208;reliance on sacrificial agents. Herein, rhenium (Re) is atomically dispersed in In2O3 to fabricate a 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst. In sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2 with H2O, 2Re&#8208;In2O3 shows a long&#8208;term stable efficiency which is enhanced by 3.5 times than that of pure In2O3 and is also higher than those on Au&#8208;In2O3, Ag&#8208;In2O3, Cu&#8208;In2O3, Ir&#8208;In2O3, Ru&#8208;In2O3, Rh&#8208;In2O3 and Pt&#8208;In2O3 photocatalysts. Moreover, carbon&#8208;based product of the photoreduction overturns from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. Re promotes charge separation, H2O dissociation and CO2 activation, thus enhancing photoreduction efficiency of CO2 on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. During the photoreduction, CO is a key intermediate. CO prefers to desorption rather than hydrogenation on pure In2O3, as CO binds to pure In2O3 very weakly. Re strengthens the interaction of CO with 2Re&#8208;In2O3 by 5.0 times, thus limiting CO desorption but enhancing CO hydrogenation to CH3OH. This could be the origin for photoreduction product overturn from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. The present work opens a new way to boost sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral B&#8208;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8208;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8208;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8208;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant&#160;polarization of 7.65 &#181;C cm&#8208;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3&#160;was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5 pC N&#8208;1&#160;for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2 V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8208;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.</dc:description>

The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA-BF3&#160;was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5 pC N-1&#160;for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as-made crystals of RMBA-BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2 V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B-N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8208;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8208;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81 mV and 124 mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18 h and 21h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8208;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes BN[9]H have been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step approach. The intrinsic helical structure and its multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence endows it with outstanding chiroptical properties. Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with M&#8208;/P&#8208;BN[9]H used as emitters exhibit a high EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and intense circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with a |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The intrinsic helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of a multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has led to an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), typically around 1&#215;10&#8722;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both a high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficient CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence with a maximum at 578&#8197;nm with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as an emitter show a maximum EQE of 35.5&#8201;%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm, and, more importantly, a high |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE&#215;gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE) was developed as a biosafe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts. SeSAE exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimic activity, effectively disrupting cellular energy and reduction equivalents to suppress tumors. The comprehensive investigation of SeSAE, from theoretical calculations to in vivo antitumor pathways, promises valuable insights into the translation of single atom nanozymes.







Abstract
Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin macrocycle is designed, which fuses quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties. A high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, improved average voltage, outstanding energy density and durable cyclability.







Abstract
Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.

Dual&#8208;atom catalysts present a promising catalytic platform for improving activity and selectivity simultaneously. In their Research Article (e202401168), Xiaohao Liu et&#8197;al. develop a universal &#8220;photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition&#8221; strategy to precisely construct In2O3&#8208;supported diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites. The strong synergism on the Angstrom scale accelerates *H spillover and electron transfer from Pd to Ir. This as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of Lentzea atacamensis uncovered two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases with the main products lentzeadiene and atacamatriene. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was observed, reminiscent of vitamin D3 biosynthesis. The cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, showing the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.







Abstract
Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.

         <title>Peptide Stapling by Crosslinking Two Amines with &#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by the crosslinking of two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents has been developed. Except for Cys, all unprotected proteinogenic amino acids are tolerated. The reactivity of Arg side chains can be effectively suppressed. The use of HFIP solvent is the key to achieving high reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as a Precursor for Regiodivergent Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity. Herein we reported the complemental character of hypervalent bromines, as aryne precursors and their behavior under transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.







Abstract
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for the alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Li2O2 Growth in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries through Regulating Oxygen Reduction Kinetics with Photo&#8208;Assisted Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept on matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration has been proposed in this work, which provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for future battery design.







Abstract
Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that follows both coexisting surface and solution pathways. However until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.

Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in-depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical lock with many keys. We show that a single macrocyclic precursor can be converted to self&#8208;immolative macrocycles that open in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. Rotaxanes and catenanes based on these rings can be triggered to release their interlocked partner. This simple macrocycle platform can be used to accelerate the development of mechanically caged molecules.







Abstract
Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to overcome the off&#8208;target toxicity of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a hypoxia&#8208;activated, azobenzene&#8208;based linker for the tumour&#8208;specific release of cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The novel ADC exhibits potent antitumor efficacy and dramatically increases the therapeutic window compared with a traditional ADC, providing a dual&#8208;targeting antibody/linker double prodrug (pro&#8208;prodrug).Author response: This edition is OK.







Abstract
Existing antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives upon internalisation of the ADCs into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &lt;1&#8201;% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &gt;99&#8201;% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour&#8208;specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour&#8208;specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia&#8208;activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene&#8208;based linker is non&#8208;cleavable in healthy tissues (O2 &gt;10&#8201;%), and the corresponding payload derivative, cysteine&#8208;appended azobenzene&#8208;linker&#8211;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicity of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O2&lt;1&#8201;%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, the azobenzene linker&#8208;containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a larger therapeutic window compared with ADCs containing traditional cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable linkers. Thus, our azobenzene&#8208;based linker sheds new light on the development of next&#8208;generation ADC linkers.

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation on defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by mixing various phases. The efficiency of C&#8722;C coupling increased with phase mixing degree of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, with a maximum FE of 81&#8201;% toward C2+ products. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the increased phase mixing degree facilitated *CO formation and retention at low and high overpotential, respectively.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8722;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81&#8201;% at maximum. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8722;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8722;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of G&#8208;rich oligonucleotides, effective G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming aptamers against HMGB1, a protein involved in inflammation and cancer, were identified. L12 was selected as the best performing aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, along with strong anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity and good HMGB1&#8208;binding affinity, which indicate it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.







Abstract
In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1)&#8212;a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer&#8212;we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5&#8197;&#956;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28&#8197;nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.

         <title>Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring&#8208;Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of ester&#8208;modified flavins with hydroxide base leads to ring&#8208;contracted imidazolonequinoxalines with increased triplet energy (ET) and H&#8208;atom abstraction (HAT) strength in the photochemically excited state. Ring&#8208;contracted flavins are efficient catalysts in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic C&#8722;H positions and also in multi&#8208;step sequences, which require the combined activity as triplet sensitizer and hydrogen atom abstractor.







Abstract
The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring&#8208;contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring&#8208;contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

     alt="Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring-Contraction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of ester-modified flavins with hydroxide base leads to ring-contracted imidazolonequinoxalines with increased triplet energy (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) and H-atom abstraction (HAT) strength in the photochemically excited state. Ring-contracted flavins are efficient catalysts in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic C&#8722;H positions and also in multi-step sequences, which require the combined activity as triplet sensitizer and hydrogen atom abstractor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring-contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring-contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In an orthogonal activity, their increased triplet energy (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8592;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=244&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) made sensitized reactions possible which exceeded the power of standard flavins. Combining both properties, ring-contracted flavin catalysts enabled the one-pot, five-step transformation of &#945;-tropolone into &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-3,4-disubstituted cyclopentanones. We envision this new class of flavin-derived chromophores to open up new modes of reactivity that are currently impossible with unmodified flavins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100 mAh g&#8208;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;11&#8208;4[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;14 cm2s&#8208;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8208; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8211;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory calculations and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the self&#8208;luminescence imaging approaches that require pre&#8208;illumination instead of real&#8208;time light excitation, afterglow luminescence imaging has attracted increasing enthusiasm to circumvent tissue autofluorescence. In this work, we developed organic afterglow luminescent nanoprobe (nanotorch), which could emit persistent luminescence more than 10 days upon single light excitation. More importantly, the nanotorch could be remote charged by 660 nm light in a non&#8208;invasive manner, which showed great potential for real&#8208;time tracing the location of macrophage cell&#8208;based microrobots.</dc:description>

         <title>Changing Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with a Reversible Rotaxane Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transmission of chiral information between the molecular, meso and microscopic scales is a facet of biology that remains challenging to understand mechanistically and to mimic with artificial systems. Here we demonstrate that the dynamic change in the expression of the chirality of a rotaxane can be transduced into a change in pitch of a soft matter system. Shuttling the position of the macrocycle from far&#8208;away&#8208;from to close&#8208;to a point&#8208;chiral center on the rotaxane axle changes the expression of the chiral information that is transmitted across length scales; from nanometer scale constitutional chirality that affects the conformation of the macrocycle, to the centimeter scale chirality of the liquid crystal phase, significantly changing the pitch length of the chiral nematic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways with Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives for Improving Second Near&#8208;Infrared Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092 nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5 mm deep&#8208;seated tissue tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Heck Coupling and Allylboration of Iododiboron Compounds via Diboryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal bis(boronates) are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. The fact that they predominantly serve as nucleophiles in the previous reports, however, has restrained their synthetic potential. Herein we disclose the ambiphilic reactivity of &#945;&#8208;halogenated geminal bis(boronates), of which the first catalytic utilization was accomplished by merging a formal Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a highly diastereoselective allylboration of aldehydes or imines, providing a new avenue for rapid assembly of polyfunctionalized boron&#8208;containing compounds. We demonstrated that this cascade reaction is highly efficient and compatible with various functional groups, and a wide range of heterocycles. In contrast to a classical Pd(0/II) scenario, mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have provided strong evidence for a catalytic cycle involving Pd(I)/diboryl carbon radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis and Reactivity of Naphthoquinonynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regiosomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing 6,7&#8208; and 5,6&#8208;aryne intermediates has been investigated. Remarkably, these studies have revealed that a broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit. The methodologies offer a powerful diversity oriented approach to C6 and C7 functionalized naphthoquinones, which are typically challenging to access. From a reactivity viewpoint, the study is significant because it demonstrates that aryne&#8208;based functionalizations can be utilized strategically in the presence of highly reactive and directly competing functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized, in situ self&#8208;assembled in primitive crystals to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity and chromaticity investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transitions relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor bandgap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Entwined Topology in Helical Covalent Polymers Dictated by Competing Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring polymeric structures often consist of 1D polymer chains intricately folded and entwined through non&#8208;covalent bonds, adopting precise topologies crucial for their functionality. The exploration of crystalline 1D polymers through dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) and supramolecular interactions represents a novel approach for developing crystalline polymers. This study shows that sub&#8208;angstrom differences in the counter&#8208;ion size can lead to various helical covalent polymer (HCP) topologies, including a novel metal&#8208;coordination HCP (m&#8208;HCP) motif. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of HCP&#8208;Na revealed double helical pairs are formed by sodium&#8208;ions coordinating to spiroborate linkages to form rectangular pores. The double helices are interpenetrated by the unreacted diols coordinating sodium&#8208;ions. The reticulation of the m&#8208;HCP structure was demonstrated by the successful synthesis of HCP&#8208;K. Finally, ion&#8208;exchange studies were conducted to show the interconversion between HCP structures. This research illustrates how seemingly simple modifications, such as changes in counter&#8208;ion size, can significantly influence the polymer topology and determine which supramolecular interactions dominate the crystal lattice.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;cycling and High&#8208;voltage Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Fluorinated and Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), constructed through the in&#8208;situ fabrication of polymer electrolytes, are considered a critical strategy for the next&#8208;generation battery systems with high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the constrained oxidation stability of polymers, such as the extensively utilized polyethers, limits their applications in high&#8208;voltage batteries and further energy density improvements. Herein, an in&#8208;situ fabricated fluorinated and crosslinked polyether&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte, FGPE, is presented, exhibiting a high oxidation potential (5.1 V). The fluorinated polyether significantly improves compatibility with both lithium metal and high&#8208;voltage cathode, attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8208;CF3 group and the generated LiF&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interphase. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries employing FGPE demonstrate exceptional cycling performances of 1000 cycles with 78% retention, representing one of the best results ever reported for polymer electrolytes. Moreover, FGPE enables batteries to operate at 4.7 V, realizing the highest operating voltage of polyether&#8208;based batteries to date. Notably, our designed in&#8208;situ FGPE provides the solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling stability even at practical conditions, including high cathode loading (21 mg cm&#8208;2) and industry&#8208;level 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells (1.3 Ah, 500 cycles). This work provides critical insights into the development of oxidation&#8208;stable polymer electrolytes and the advancement of practical high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Enables the Cathodic Interface Reaction Reversibility in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited triple&#8208;phase boundaries arising from the accumulation of solid discharge product(s) in solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs) pose a challenge to high&#8208;property solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (SSLOBs). Light&#8208;assisted SSLOBs have been gradually explored as an ingenious system; however, the fundamental mechanisms of the SSCs interface behavior remain unclear. Here, we discovered that light assistance can enhance the fast inner&#8208;sphere charge transfer in SSCs and regulate the discharge products with spherical particles generated via the surface growth model. Moreover, the high photoelectron excitation and transportation capabilities of SSCs can retard cathodic catalytic decay by avoiding structural degradation of the cathode with a reduced charge voltage. The light&#8208;induced SSLOBs exhibited excellent stability (170 cycles) with a low discharge&#8211;charge polarization overpotential (0.27 V).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Limited triple-phase boundaries arising from the accumulation of solid discharge product(s) in solid-state cathodes (SSCs) pose a challenge to high-property solid-state lithium-oxygen batteries (SSLOBs). Light-assisted SSLOBs have been gradually explored as an ingenious system; however, the fundamental mechanisms of the SSCs interface behavior remain unclear. Here, we discovered that light assistance can enhance the fast inner-sphere charge transfer in SSCs and regulate the discharge products with spherical particles generated via the surface growth model. Moreover, the high photoelectron excitation and transportation capabilities of SSCs can retard cathodic catalytic decay by avoiding structural degradation of the cathode with a reduced charge voltage. The light-induced SSLOBs exhibited excellent stability (170 cycles) with a low discharge&#8211;charge polarization overpotential (0.27 V). Furthermore, transparent SSLOBs with exceptional flexibility, mechanical stability, and multiform shapes were fabricated for theory-to-practical applications in sunlight-induced batteries. Our study opens new opportunities for the introduction of solar energy into energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Phenanthrene Imide&#8208;Based Polymers for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors are crucial for the applications of organic electronics, however strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties for constructing them are still limited. The imide&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, high electron deficiency and good solubility serve as promising candidates for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers. Among these PAHs, phenanthrene (PhA) features a well&#8208;delocalized aromatic &#960;&#8208;system with multiple active sites to functionalize. However, the PhA&#8208;based imides are seldom studied, mainly attributed to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we reported two functionalized PhA moieties, CPOI and CPCNI, by simultaneously incorporating imide with carbonyl or dicyanomethylene onto PhA. Notably, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;modified CPCNI exhibits a well stabilized LUMO energy level (&#8208;3.84 eV), attributed to the synergetic inductive effect from imide and cyano groups. Subsequently, based on CPOI and CPCNI, two polymers PCPOI&#8208;Tz and PCPCNI&#8208;Tz were developed. Applied to organic thin&#8208;film transistors, owing to the strong electron&#8208;deficient character of CPCNI, polymer PCPCNI&#8208;Tz shows an improved electron mobility and largely decreased threshold voltage compared with PCPOI&#8208;Tz. This work affords two structurally novel electron&#8208;deficient building blocks and highlights the effectiveness of dual functionalization of PhAs with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for devising n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Nanographenes Bearing Pentagon&#8208;Heptagon Pairs by Stepwise Dehydrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs into helical nanographenes lacks a facile synthetic route, and the impact of these pairs on chiroptical properties remains unclear. In this study, a method for the stepwise construction of pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs in helical nanographenes by the dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units was developed. Three helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs were synthesized and characterized using this approach. A wide variation in the molecular geometries and photophysical properties of these helical nanographenes was observed, with changes in the helical length of these structures and the introduction of the pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs. The embedded pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs reduced the oxidation potential of the synthesized helical nanographenes. The high isomerization energy barriers enabled the chiral resolution of the helicene enantiomers. Chiroptical investigations revealed remarkably enhanced circularly polarized luminescence and luminescence dissymmetry factors with an increasing number of the pentagon&#8211;heptagon pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift for the Visualization of Rapid Protein and Nucleic Acid Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores, characterized by flexible chemical structure and adjustable optical performance, have shown tremendous potential in biosensing. However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength&#8208;tunable small&#8208;molecule fluorescent dyes (  PTs  ) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262 nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000~100,000 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1, with quantum yields up to 54.8%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (  PT&#8208;NPs  ), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20 fM with naked eye, a 100&#8208;fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold&#8208;based LFA. Besides, combined with loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).</dc:description>

         <title>"Off&#8208;Label" Use of Enterobactin Enables Targeted Imaging of Cancer with Radioactive Ti(IV)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of inert, biocompatible chelation methods is required to harness the emerging positron emitting radionuclide&#160;45Ti for radiopharmaceutical applications.&#160;Herein, we evaluate the Ti(IV)&#8208;coordination chemistry of four catechol&#8208;based, hexacoordinate chelators using synthetic, structural, computational, and radiochemical approaches. The siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and its synthetic mimic TREN&#8208;CAM, readily form mononuclear Ti(IV)&#160;species in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Radiolabeling studies revealed that Ent and TREN&#8208;CAM form mononuclear complexes with the short&#8208;lived, positron&#8208;emitting radionuclide45Ti(IV), and that these complexes do not transchelate to plasma proteins in vitro and exhibit rapid renal clearance in na&#239;ve mice. These features guided efforts to target the&#160;45Ti isotope to prostate cancer tissue through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Ent&#8208;DUPA, a small molecule conjugate composed of a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting peptide and a monofunctionalized Ent scaffold. The [45Ti][Ti(Ent&#8208;DUPA)]2&#8208;&#160;complex formed readily at room temperature and in a tumor xenograft model in mice, displayed selective tumor tissue accumulation (8&#177;&#160;5%, n=5), and low off&#8208;target uptake in other organs. Overall, this work demonstrates targeted imaging with&#160;45Ti(IV), provides a foundation for advancing the application of&#160;45Ti in nuclear medicine, and reveals that Ent can be repurposed as a&#160;45Ti&#8208;complexing cargo for targeted nuclear imaging applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have synthesized a quinone&#8208;incorporated bistriarylamine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) semiconductor molecule 1 by B(C6F5)3 (BCF) catalyzed C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF&#160;and Al(ORF)3 (RF = C(CF3)3) to the semiconductor 1 afforded diradical zwitterions 2 and 3 by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of 1 is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93 eV (1) to 1.01 eV (2) and 1.06 eV (3). 2 and 3 are rare near&#8208;infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500 nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light&#8208;dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110 &#176;C in 10 s upon the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) laser (1064 nm, 0.7 W cm&#8208;2), exhibiting a fast response to laser.

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid structuring usually relies on the interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants. Here we show that not only droplets in non&#8208;equilibrium shapes but also printed liquid patterns with useful geometries can be created from a highly interfacial active molecular Gemini surfactant that generates elastic, &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; monolayers at the oil/water interface. The surfactant can also be used to produce ultra&#8208;stable emulsions with potent lubricity.







Abstract
To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By having a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries by using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic terminus, the surfactant can endow the resultant emulsions with favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Difluoromethyl Carbonyl Compounds from N&#8208;Difluoromethylcarbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives was developed. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride that can be further diversified to a diversity of N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds including amides, carbamates, ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates with rich functionality.







Abstract
Fluorinated small molecules are commonly used in functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are particularly intriguing due to their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Here, guided by computation, we present a simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol involves a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides through desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a variety of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Additionally, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their potential application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleic Acids in a Diffusiophoretic Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steep salt gradient generated by an electrolyte&#8208;filled micropipette can be utilized for diffusiophoretic trapping of charged colloids and molecules. The trap can localize, concentrate and promote hybridization between complementary DNA strands, and facilitate the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures into DNA gels. Assembly of the gel only occurs under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, when the salt gradient is present.







Abstract
The formation and dissociation of duplexes or higher order structures from nucleic acid strands is a fundamental process with widespread applications in biochemistry and nanotechnology. Here, we introduce a simple experimental system&#8212;a diffusiophoretic trap&#8212;for the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly of nucleic acid structures that uses an electrolyte gradient as the driving force. DNA strands can be concentrated up to hundredfold by a diffusiophoretic trapping force that is caused by the electric field generated by the electrolyte gradient. We present a simple equation for the field to guide selection of appropriate trapping electrolytes. Experiments with carboxylated silica particles demonstrate that the diffusiophoretic force is long&#8208;ranged, extending over hundreds of micrometers. As an application, we explore the reversible self&#8208;assembly of branched DNA nanostructures in the trap into a macroscopic gel. The structures assemble in the presence of an electrolyte gradient, and disassemble upon its removal, representing a prototypical adaptive response to a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium state.

         <title>Deoxygenative Transformation of Alcohols via Phosphoranyl Radical from Exogenous Radical Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to the direct deoxygenative transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols has been developed. It undergoes through phosphoranyl radical intermediates generated by the addition of exogenous iodine radical to trivalent alkoxylphosphanes. Since these alkoxylphosphanes are readily in situ obtained from alcohols and commercially available, inexpensive chlorodiphenylphosphine, a diverse range of alcohols with various functional groups can be utilized to proceed deoxygenative cross&#8208;couplings with alkenes or aryl iodides. The selective transformation of polyhydroxy substrates and the rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules are also demonstrated with this method.

         <title>Zinc ion Batteries: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great promise for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the practical capability of ZIBs is ambiguous due to technical gaps between small scale laboratory coin cells and large commercial energy storage systems. This Minireview explores limiting factors for ZIBs practicality, using formulations to estimate practical energy density and predict battery lifespan in lab research activities.







Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) exhibit significant promise in the next generation of grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their safety, relatively high volumetric energy density, and low production cost. Despite substantial advancements in ZIBs, a comprehensive evaluation of critical parameters impacting their practical energy density (Epractical) and calendar life is lacking. Hence, we suggest using formulation&#8208;based study as a scientific tool to accurately calculate the cell&#8208;level energy density and predict the cycling life of ZIBs. By combining all key battery parameters, such as the capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P), into one formula, we assess their impact on Epractical. When all parameters are optimized, we urge to achieve the theoretical capacity for a high Epractical. Furthermore, we propose a formulation that correlates the N/P and Coulombic efficiency of ZIBs for predicting their calendar life. Finally, we offer a comprehensive overview of current advancements in ZIBs, covering cathode and anode, along with practical evaluations. This Minireview outlines specific goals, suggests future research directions, and sketches prospects for designing efficient and high&#8208;performing ZIBs. It aims at bridging the gap from academia to industry for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, is reported. The cation&#8208;anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li3MX6 family. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.







Abstract
The Li3MX6 compounds (M=Sc, Y, In; X=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure &#945;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing non&#8208;planar monomers to regulate the interlayer stacking of covalent triazine framework (CTF) membranes formed by planar monomers, we can exert effective control over the pore size in the staggered stacking structure of CTF membrane. Through the coordinated adjustment of stacking space and pore surface properties, the effective separation of aromatic/aliphatic organic mixtures in all&#8208;liquid phase has been successfully realized.







Abstract
Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200&#8197;Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;stable Supramolecular Framework Based on Consecutive Side&#8208;by&#8208;side Hydrogen Bonds for One&#8208;step C2H4/C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MTHOF&#8208;1) has been successfully assembled by side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bond chains. This HOF can be used to directly obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from a C2H4/C2H6 mixture at different temperatures and different relative humid conditions.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step efficient separation of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures by hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) faces two problems: lack of strategies for constructing stable pores in HOFs and how to obtain high C2H6 selectivity. Herein, we have developed a microporous Mortise&#8208;Tenon&#8208;type HOF (MTHOF&#8208;1, MT is short for Mortise&#8208;Tenon structure) with a new self&#8208;assembly mode for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Unlike previous HOFs which usually possess discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head hydrogen bonds, MTHOF&#8208;1 is assembled by unique consecutive side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bonds, which result in mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon pores decorated with orderly arranged amide groups and benzene rings. As expected, MTHOF&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability under various conditions and shows clear separation trends for C2H6/C2H4. The IAST selectivity is as high as 2.15 at 298&#8197;K. More importantly, dynamic breakthrough experiments have demonstrated that MTHOF&#8208;1 can effectively separate the C2H6/C2H4 feed gas to obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 in one step even under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Making Plasticized Polymer Electrolytes Stable Against Sodium Metal for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new plasticized polymer electrolyte integrated with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive was reported to address the interface instability issue existing in sodium metal batteries. Impressively, dome&#8208;like Na0 nucleation/growth with thin, amorphous, and fluoride&#8208;rich SEIs was identified, enabling excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 pouch cells (93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3) at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes based on plastic crystals are promising for solid&#8208;state sodium metal (Na0) batteries, yet their practicality has been hindered by the notorious Na0&#8208;electrolyte interface instability issue, the underlying cause of which remains poorly understood. Here, by leveraging a model plasticized polymer electrolyte based on conventional succinonitrile plastic crystals, we uncover its failure origin in Na0 batteries is associated with the formation of a thick and non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and whiskery Na0 nucleation/growth. Furthermore, we design a new additive&#8208;embedded plasticized polymer electrolyte to manipulate the Na0 deposition and SEI formulation. For the first time, we demonstrate that introducing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive into the succinonitrile&#8208;plasticized polymer electrolyte can effectively protect Na0 against interfacial corrosion by facilitating the growth of dome&#8208;like Na0 with thin, amorphous, and fluorine&#8208;rich SEIs, thus enabling significantly improved performances of Na//Na symmetric cells (1,800&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (93.0&#8201;% capacity retention after 1,200 cycles at 1&#8197;C rate in coin cells and 93.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3 in pouch cells at room temperature). Our work provides valuable insights into the interfacial failure of plasticized polymer electrolytes and offers a promising solution to resolving the interfacial instability issue.

A newly developed phenothiazine&#8208;based catalyst served as an efficient catalyst for defluoroaminoxylation. Spectroscopic measurements revealed the reaction mechanism. AlCl3 facilitated further defluorinative transformation of the aminoxylated compounds.







Abstract
A sequential process via photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid mediation for C&#8722;F bond transformation of the CF2 unit in perfluoroalkyl groups has been achieved to transform perfluoroalkylarenes into complex fluoroalkylated compounds. A phenothiazine&#8208;based photocatalyst promotes the defluoroaminoxylation of perfluoroalkylarenes with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) under visible light irradiation, affording the corresponding aminoxylated products. These products undergo a further defluorinative transformation with various organosilicon reagents mediated by AlCl3 to provide highly functionalized perfluoroalkyl alcohols. Our novel phenothiazine catalyst works efficiently in the defluoroaminoxylation. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the catalyst regeneration step is crucial for the photocatalytic aminoxylation.

         <title>Phosphorane&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;C Coupling during Aryne Annulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high potential energy of aryne intermediates can induce reactions that proceed through unorthodox mechanisms. Herein we report the aryne&#8208;promoted formation of various helical dibenzochalcophenes from phosphine chalcogenides. Based on DFT computations we propose a mechanism to account for the final C&#8722;C bond formation that involves a rare, concerted ligand&#8208;coupling event within a hypervalent &#963;&#8208;phosphorane.







Abstract
Arynes are fleeting, high&#8208;energy intermediates that undergo myriad trapping reactions by nucleophiles. Their unusual reactivity compared to other electrophiles can spur unexpected mechanistic pathways enroute to the formation of benzenoid products. Herein we explore a particularly unique case of thermally generated arynes reacting with phosphoranes to form helical dibenzothiophenes and &#8208;selenophenes. Multiple new helical polycyclic aromatic products are reported. DP4+ and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis were used in tandem to confirm the structural topologies of selected products and to demonstrate the utility of DP4+ for distinguishing between isomeric polycyclic aromatic compounds. Lastly, we discuss a plausible mechanism consistent with DFT computations that accounts for the product formation; namely, ligand coupling (i.e., reductive elimination) within a hypervalent, pentacarbon&#8208;ligated &#963;&#8208;phosphorane furnishes the dibenzothio&#8208; or dibenzoselenophene.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Fullerene Membranes for Ultimate Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel two&#8208;dimensional (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membranes were assembled by the stacking of porous polymeric fullerene nanosheets. The nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the well&#8208;controlled depolymerization of polymeric fullerene crystals and sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels between adjacent polymeric fullerene nanosheets provide ultrashort pathways for the fast permeation and efficient molecular sieving for various organic solvents.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with high chemical stability have attracted intensive interest in membrane design for the separation of organic solvents. As a novel 2D material, polymeric fullerenes (C60)&#8734; with distinctive properties are very promising for the development of innovative membranes. In this work, we report the construction of a 2D (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane for organic solvent separation. The pathways of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane are constructed by sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels and nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the depolymerization of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheets. Attributing to ordered and shortened transport pathways, the ultrathin porous (C60)&#8734; membrane is superior in organic solvent separation. The hexane, acetone, and methanol fluxes are up to 1146.3&#177;53, 900.4&#177;41, and 879.5&#177;42&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, which are up to 130 times higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with similar dye rejection. Our findings demonstrate the prospect of 2D (C60)&#8734; as a promising nanofiltration membrane in the separation of organic solvents from macromolecular compounds such as dyes, drugs, hormones, etc.

         <title>A Triply&#8208;Periodic&#8208;Minimal&#8208;Surface Structured Interphase based on Fluorinated Polymers Strengthening High&#8208;energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The challenge of constructing a mechanically robust yet lightweight artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on lithium (Li) anodes highlights a trade&#8208;off between high battery safety and high energy density. Inspired by the intricate microstructure of the white sea urchin, we first develop a polyvinyl fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) interfacial layer with a triple periodic minimal surface structure (TPMS) that could offer maximal modulus with minimal weight. This design endows high mechanical strength to an ordered porous structure, effectively reduces local current density, polarization, and internal resistance, and stabilizes the anode interface. At a low N/P ratio of ~ 3, using LiFePO4 as the cathode, Li anodes protected by TPMS&#8208;structured PVDF&#8208;HFP achieve an extremely low capacity&#8208;fading&#8208;rate of approximately 0.002% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average discharge capacity of 142 mAh g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the TPMS porous structure saves 50 wt.% of the interfacial layer mass, thereby enhancing the energy density of the battery. The TPMS structure is conducive to large&#8208;scale additive manufacturing, which will provide a reference for the future development of lightweight, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal Oxidation Electrochemiluminescence Mechanism of Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks via Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency is determined by charge transfer between coreactants and emitters in coreactant systems, which are usually limited by their slow intermolecular charge transfer. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) with aldehyde residue was synthesized, and then coreactants were covalently integrated into the skeleton through the post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy, resulting in a crystalline coreactant&#8208;embedded COF nanoemitter (C&#8208;COF). Compared to the pristine COF with an equivalent external coreactant, C&#8208;COF exhibited an extraordinary 1008&#8208;fold enhancement of ECL intensity due to the rapid intrareticular charge transfer. Significantly, with the pH increase, C&#8208;COF shows protonation&#8208;induced ECL enhancement for the first ECL peaked at +1.1 V and an opposite trend for the second ECL at +1.4 V, which were attributed to the antedating oxidation of coreactant in framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation, respectively. The resulting bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism was rationalized by spectral characterization and density functional theory calculations. The postsynthetic coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitters present innovative and universal avenues for advancing ECL systems.</dc:description>

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability.

Even at 5 A g&#8208;1, 259.4 mAh g&#8208;1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self-catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple-shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3 mAh g-1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A g-1, which is superior to previously-reported results. Even at 5 A g-1, 259.4 mAh g-1 (83.68 %) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast-charging&#8221; high-energy-density rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing and Regulating Dynamic Evolution of Interfacial Electrolyte Configuration during De&#8208;solvation Process on Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acting as a passive protective layer, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Li&#8208;metal anode. Derived from the reductive decomposition of electrolytes (e.g., anion and solvent), the SEI construction presents as an interfacial process accompanied by the dynamic de&#8208;solvation process during Li&#8208;metal plating. However, typical electrolyte engineering and related SEI modification strategies always ignore the dynamic evolution of electrolyte configuration at the Li/electrolyte interface, which essentially determines the SEI architecture. Herein, by employing advanced electrochemical in&#8208;situ FT&#8208;IR and MRI technologies, we directly visualize the dynamic variations of solvation environments involving Li+&#8208;solvent/anion. Remarkably, a weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interaction and anion&#8208;lean interfacial electrolyte configuration have been synchronously revealed, which is difficult for the fabrication of anion&#8208;derived SEI layer. Moreover, as a simple electrochemical regulation strategy, pulse protocol was introduced to effectively restore the interfacial anion concentration, resulting in an enhanced LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer and improved Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Isocyanides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has emerged as an important research topic in modern drug development because they can serve as saturated bioisosters to enhance the physicochemical properties and metabolic profiles of drug candidates. Here we report a remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and isocyanides. The process is proposed to involve a formal [3+3]/[3+2]/retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition sequence. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be easily derivatized, further enriching the BCB cycloaddition chemistry and the growing set of valuable sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(benzoselenadiazol)ethane: A &#960;&#8208;Extended Acceptor&#8208;Dimeric Unit for Ambipolar Polymer Transistors with Hole and Electron Mobilities Exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of ambipolar polymers with balanced hole (&#956;h) and electron mobilities (&#956;e) &gt;10 cm2 V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is the main bottleneck for developing organic integrated circuits. Herein, we show the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended selenium&#8208;containing acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethane (BBSeE), to address this dilemma. In comparison to its sulfur&#8208;counterpart, BBSeE demonstrates deeper frontier molecular orbital levels and stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. The successful stannylation of BBSeE offers a great opportunity to access acceptor&#8208;acceptor copolymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, which shows a narrower band gap, lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (&#8722;4.05 eV), and a higher degree of backbone planarity. Consequently, the pN&#8208;BBSeE&#8208;based organic transistors display an ideally balanced ambipolar transport with &#956;h and &#956;e of 10.08 and 10.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous &#956;h /&#956;e values &gt;10.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are the best performances ever reported for ambipolar polymers. In addition, pN&#8208;BBSeE shows an excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability, retaining over 85% of the initial mobility values after two months storage. Our study demonstrates the &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric BBSeE is a promising acceptor building block for constructing high&#8208;performance ambipolar polymers applied in next&#8208;generation organic integrated circuit.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition metal oxides are extensively considered as appealing cathode candidates for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their abundant raw materials and low cost, but their further implementations are limited by slow dynamics and impoverished structural stability. Herein, a layered composite having a P2 and P3 symbiotic structure is designed and synthesized to realize PIBs with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The unique intergrowth of P2 and P3 phases in the obtained layered oxide is plainly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction refinement, high&#8208;angle annular dark field and annular bright field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution, and Fourier transformation images. The synergistic effect of the two phases of this layered P2/P3 composite is well demonstrated in K+ intercalation/extraction process. The as&#8208;prepared layered composite can present a large discharge capacity with the remarkable energy density of 321 Wh kg  &#8722;1 and also manifest excellent capacity preservation after 600 cycles of K+ uptake/removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Dots with Delayed Fluorescence and Tunable Cellular Uptake for Photodynamic Therapy and Time&#8208;Gated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By combining bioimaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), it is possible to treat cancer through a theranostic approach with targeted action for minimum invasiveness and side effects. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) probes have gained recent interest in theranostics due to their ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) while providing delayed emission that can be used in time&#8208;gated imaging. However, it is still challenging to design systems that simultaneously show (1) high contrast for imaging, (2) low dark toxicity but high phototoxicity and (3) tunable biological uptake. Here, we circumvent shortcomings of TADF systems by designing block copolymers and their corresponding semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) that encapsulate a TADF dye in the core and expose an additional boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) oxygen sensitizer in the corona. This architecture provides orange&#8208;red luminescent particles (&#934;PL up to 18%) that can efficiently promote PDT (1O2 QY = 42%) of HeLa cells with very low photosensitizer loading (IC50 ~0.05&#8211;0.13 &#181;g/mL after 30 min). Additionally, we design Pdots with tunable cellular uptake but similar PDT efficiencies using either polyethylene glycol or guanidinium&#8208;based coronas. Finally, we demonstrate that these Pdots can be used for time&#8208;gated imaging to effectively filter out background fluorescence from biological samples and improve image contrast.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conformational flexibility and chirality both play a key role in molecular recognition. It is therefore very useful to develop spectroscopic methods that simultaneously probe both properties. It has been theoretically predicted that photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) should be very sensitive to conformational isomerism. However, experimental proof has been less forthcoming and only exists for a very few favorable cases. Here, we present a new PECD scheme based on resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization (RE2PI) using UV/Vis nanosecond laser excitations. The spectral resolution obtained thereby guarantees conformer&#8208;selectivity by inducing resonant conformer&#8208;specific pp* S1&#172;S0 transitions. We apply this experimental scheme to the study of chiral 1&#8208;indanol, which exists in two conformers linked by a ring inversion and defined by the position of the hydroxyl group, namely axial and equatorial. We show that the PECD of the equatorial and axial forms considerably differ in sign, magnitude and shape. We also discuss the influence of the total ionization energy, vibronic excitation of intermediate and final states, and relative polarization of the excitation and ionization lasers. Conformer&#8208;specificity adds a new dimension to the applications of PECD in analytical chemistry addressing now the general case of floppy systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conformational flexibility and chirality both play a key role in molecular recognition. It is therefore very useful to develop spectroscopic methods that simultaneously probe both properties. It has been theoretically predicted that photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) should be very sensitive to conformational isomerism. However, experimental proof has been less forthcoming and only exists for a very few favorable cases. Here, we present a new PECD scheme based on resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization (RE2PI) using UV/Vis nanosecond laser excitations. The spectral resolution obtained thereby guarantees conformer-selectivity by inducing resonant conformer-specific pp* S1&#172;S0 transitions. We apply this experimental scheme to the study of chiral 1-indanol, which exists in two conformers linked by a ring inversion and defined by the position of the hydroxyl group, namely axial and equatorial. We show that the PECD of the equatorial and axial forms considerably differ in sign, magnitude and shape. We also discuss the influence of the total ionization energy, vibronic excitation of intermediate and final states, and relative polarization of the excitation and ionization lasers.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Galactocation to Sialic Acid on Tumor Cells with A Penta&#8208;Functional Dendritic Probe for Enhanced Immuno&#8208;Killing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans on tumor cell surface have significant impacts in the immune&#8208;killing process. Here an ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid (Sia) strategy is designed to hugely introduce galactose (Gal) to Sia and on tumor cells in vivo by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F), which efficiently enhances the immune&#8208;killing of tumor cells. The Den@5F contains five different kinds of functional groups, including Gal, Cy5, amino, phenylboronic acid (PBA) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;nitrophenoxy) butanoate (mNB), which can be conveniently prepared through a two&#8208;step reaction. After injecting into the tumor&#8208;bearing mouse, Den@5F can efficiently block Sia through the specific recognition between PBA and Sia on tumor cells and hugely introduce Gal through the subsequent photo&#8208;crosslinking between mNB and amino groups to multiply conjugate excessive Den@5Fs. The comprehensively blocked Sia can prevent the immune escape, and the hugely introduced Gal can promote the immune stimulation of the immune cells, which lead to an efficient enhancement of the immune&#8208;killing. The proposed strategy provides a significant and promising tool to promote the clinical immunotherapy of tumor.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Promoted Cycloadditions in Lipid Bilayers Triggered by Liposome Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon membrane fusion and lipid mixing, the embedded functional dyes undergo cycloaddition to form the covalently bound product, resulting in the emission of FRET signal, which remains even after liposome destruction.







Abstract
Due to the variety of roles served by the cell membrane, its composition and structure are complex, making it difficult to study. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as the strain promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), are powerful tools for exploring the function of biomolecules in their native environment but have been largely unexplored within the context of lipid bilayers. Here, we developed a new approach to study the SPAAC reaction in liposomal membranes using azide&#8208; and strained alkyne&#8208;functionalized F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dye pairs. This study represents the first characterization of the SPAAC reaction between diffusing molecules inside liposomal membranes. Potential applications of this work include in situ bioorthogonal labeling of membrane proteins, improved understanding of membrane dynamics and fluidity, and the generation of new probes for biosensing assays.

         <title>SN2 Reaction at the Amide Nitrogen Center Enables Hydrazide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N&#8722;N coupling approach to the practical synthesis of hydrazides is disclosed by employing an SN2 strategy at electrophilic amides with nucleophilic amines. The reaction exhibits mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, easy scalability, and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions are fundamentally important transformations in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite the substantial advances in bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) at saturated carbon centers, analogous SN2 reaction at the amide nitrogen atom remains extremely limited. Here we report an SN2 substitution method at the amide nitrogen atom with amine nucleophiles for nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bond formation that leads to a novel strategy toward biologically and medicinally important hydrazide derivatives. We found the use of sulfonate&#8208;leaving groups at the amide nitrogen atom played a pivotal role in the reaction. This new N&#8722;N coupling reaction allows the use of O&#8208;tosyl hydroxamates as electrophiles and readily available amines, including acyclic aliphatic amines and saturated N&#8208;heterocycles as nucleophiles. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples), excellent functional group tolerability, and scalability. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of various approved drug molecules, thus enabling complex hydrazide scaffold synthesis.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Thiophene Based Conjugated Polymer Cathode with High Capacity for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porphyrin conjugated polymer cathode, COP500&#8208;CuT2TP is achieved under electrochemical polymerization. Self&#8208;exfoliation of polymer cathode promotes charge storage, leading to a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved. Mechanistic insights by combining experimental and computational investigations supports the charge storage performance.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage materials due to their environmental friendliness and sustainable renewability. However, problems such as their high solubility in electrolytes and low intrinsic conductivity have always plagued their further application. Polymerization to form conjugated organic polymers can not only inhibit the dissolution of organic electrodes in the electrolyte, but also enhance the intrinsic conductivity of organic molecules. Herein, we synthesized a new conjugated organic polymer (COPs) COP500&#8208;CuT2TP (poly [5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl) porphyrinato] copper (II)) by electrochemical polymerization method. Due to the self&#8208;exfoliation behavior, the porphyrin cathode exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high specific energy of 900&#8197;Wh&#8201;Kg&#8722;1 with a first coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Excellent cycling stability up to 8000&#8197;cycles without capacity loss was achieved even at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This highly conjugated structure promotes COP500&#8208;CuT2TP combined high energy density, high power density, and good cycling stability, which would open new opportunity for the designable and versatile organic electrodes for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Mechanocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia: State of the Catalyst During Reaction and Deactivation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ammonia over a Cs&#8208;promoted Fe catalyst via the novel approach of mechanocatalysis is carefully studied by ex situ characterizations of the catalyst. Physicochemical changes are related to the different stages of ammonia formation. Optimizations based on these results resulted in the intrinsically complicated low&#8208;temperature ammonia synthesis being one of the longest stable mechanocatalytic gas&#8208;phase reactions to date.







Abstract
Ammonia synthesis holds significant importance for both agricultural fertilizer production and emerging green energy applications. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a catalyst for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis, based on Cs&#8208;promoted Fe. The study sheds light on the catalyst&#8216;s dynamic evolution under reaction conditions and the origin of deactivation. Initially, elemental Cs converts to CsH, followed by partial CsOH formation due to trace oxygen impurities on the surface of the Fe metal and the equipment. Concurrently, the mechanical milling process comminutes Fe, exposing fresh metallic Fe surfaces. This comminution correlates with an induction period observed during ammonia formation. Critical to the study, degradation of active Cs promoter species (CsH and CsNH2) into inactive CsOH emerged as the primary deactivation mechanism. By increasing the Cs content from 2.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% to 4.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%, we achieved stable, continuous ammonia synthesis for nearly 90&#8197;hours, showcasing one of the longest&#8208;running mechanocatalytic gas phase reactions. Studies of the temperature dependence of the reaction revealed negligible bulk temperature influence in the range of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to 100&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the dominance of mechanical action over bulk thermal effects.

     alt="Mechanocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia: State of the Catalyst During Reaction and Deactivation Pathway"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of ammonia over a Cs-promoted Fe catalyst via the novel approach of mechanocatalysis is carefully studied by ex situ characterizations of the catalyst. Physicochemical changes are related to the different stages of ammonia formation. Optimizations based on these results resulted in the intrinsically complicated low-temperature ammonia synthesis being one of the longest stable mechanocatalytic gas-phase reactions to date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia synthesis holds significant importance for both agricultural fertilizer production and emerging green energy applications. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of a catalyst for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis, based on Cs-promoted Fe. The study sheds light on the catalyst&#8216;s dynamic evolution under reaction conditions and the origin of deactivation. Initially, elemental Cs converts to CsH, followed by partial CsOH formation due to trace oxygen impurities on the surface of the Fe metal and the equipment. Concurrently, the mechanical milling process comminutes Fe, exposing fresh metallic Fe surfaces. This comminution correlates with an induction period observed during ammonia formation. Critical to the study, degradation of active Cs promoter species (CsH and CsNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into inactive CsOH emerged as the primary deactivation mechanism. By increasing the Cs content from 2.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% to 4.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%, we achieved stable, continuous ammonia synthesis for nearly 90&#8197;hours, showcasing one of the longest-running mechanocatalytic gas phase reactions. Studies of the temperature dependence of the reaction revealed negligible bulk temperature influence in the range of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to 100&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the dominance of mechanical action over bulk thermal effects. This study offers insights into the complex interplay between mechanical processing, reactive species, and deactivation mechanisms in mechanocatalytic ammonia synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Rhodium (III) Complexes in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photothermal Heterogeneous C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general post&#8208;synthetic strategy for constructing bifunctional catalysts, Rh&#8208;COF, which connect photosensitive covalent organic frameworks and transition&#8208;metal catalytic groups through covalent bonding, was developed. Fascinatingly, such complexes enable efficient photothermal conversion properties, which can improve the photothermal catalytic performances in C&#8722;H activation to obtain excellent yield, substrate suitability and recyclability.







Abstract
Although photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high&#8208;temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C&#8722;H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh&#8208;COF&#8208;316 and &#8208;318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition&#8208;metal catalytic moiety using a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The Rh&#8208;COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8722;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) formation at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF&#8208;316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;T=50.9&#8201;&#176;C), thus accelerating C&#8722;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.

         <title>Controllable Double Difluoromethylene Insertions into S&#8722;Cu Bonds: (Arylthio)tetrafluoroethylation of Aryl Iodides with TMSCF2Br</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into S&#8722;Cu bonds have been developed with TMSCF2Br reagent, which provides a general synthetic protocol to contruct ArSCF2CF2Cu intermediates as well as the ArSCF2CF2Ar&#8242; products.







Abstract
A new method of constructing &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; from ArSCu and TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) has been developed. The cross&#8208;coupling reactions of the obtained &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; with diverse aryl iodides (Ar&#8242;I) provide an efficient access to Ar&#8242;CF2CF2SAr. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the &#8220;ArSCF2CF2Cu&#8221; species were generated through controllable double difluoromethylene insertions into ArS&#8722;Cu bonds rather than the 1,2&#8208;addition of ArSCu to tetrafluoroethylene.

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;Step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of C5/C6 alkane isomers for octane upgrading of gasoline was achieved for the first time by one single material, an unprecedented scalable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Fe trimers and pyrazole&#8208;carboxylate ligands with a multi&#8208;cage structure with flu&#8208;e topology.







Abstract
The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane&#8811;n&#8208;pentane&#8776;2&#8208;methylpentane&gt;3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&#8811;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane&#8776;i&#8208;pentane&#8776;2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Molecular Motor&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers Revealed by High&#8208;Speed AFM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic light&#8208;triggered depolymerisation of chiral molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymers has been observed in real time with High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). These results show the depolymerisation selectively from the polymer ends through a cooperative process.







Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have a major potential for applications in responsive materials that are externally triggered by light with spatio&#8208;temporal control of their polymerisation state. While changes in macroscopic properties revealed the adaptive nature of these materials, it remains challenging to capture the dynamic depolymerisation process at the molecular level, which requires fast observation techniques combined with in situ irradiation. By implementing in situ UV illumination into a High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS&#8208;AFM) setup, we have been able to capture the disassembly of a light&#8208;driven molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymer. The real&#8208;time visualisation of the light&#8208;triggered disassembly process not only reveals cooperative depolymerisation, it also shows that this process continues after illumination is halted. Combining the data with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we obtain a molecular&#8208;level description of the motor&#8208;based polymer dynamics reminiscent of actin chain&#8208;end depolymerisation. Our detailed understanding of supramolecular depolymerisation will drive the development of future responsive polymer systems.

The proposed fluoridated pore engineering strategy endows a cage&#8208;like MOF with molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation and highly efficient purification of C3F8 electronic specialty gas. Moreover, hydrophobic microenvironments generated by fluoridation groups significantly boost the chemical stability of MOF.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc=5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8722;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained.

         <title>Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24&#8212;A Chromium(+IV) Nitridosilicate Phosphate with Amphibole&#8208;Type Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24, the first nitridic analog to amphibole minerals, was obtained at high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions. The structure was elucidated by microfocused synchrotron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic measurements, which were able to prove the partial disorder of Si and Cr and the oxidation state +IV of chromium.







Abstract
The first nitridic analog of an amphibole mineral, the quaternary nitridosilicate phosphate Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8197;GPa from the binary nitrides Cr2N, Si3N4 and P3N5, using NH4N3 and NH4F as additional nitrogen source and mineralizing agent, respectively. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation (C2/m, a=9.6002(19), b=17.107(3), c=4.8530(10)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=109.65(3)&#176;). The elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The structure consists of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming zweier double chains and edge&#8208;sharing (Si,Cr)&#8208;centered octahedra forming separated ribbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy shows ordered Si and Cr sites next to a disordered Si/Cr site. Optical spectroscopy indicates a band gap of 2.1&#8197;eV. Susceptibility measurements show paramagnetic behavior and support the oxidation state Cr+IV, which is confirmed by EPR. The comprehensive analysis expands the field of Cr&#8722;N chemistry and provides access to a nitride analog of one of the most prevalent silicate structures.

         <title>Regulating Charge Transport Dynamics at the Buried Interface and Bulk of Perovskites by Tailored&#8208;phase 2D Crystal Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting the trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation occurring at the interface and bulk of perovskite, especially the overlooked buried bottom interface, a strategy of tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional (TP&#8208;2D) crystal seed layer has been developed to improve the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and bulk of perovskite films. Using this approach, TP&#8208;2D layer constructed by TP&#8208;2D crystal seeds at the buried interface can induce the formation of homogeneous interface electric field, which effectively suppress the accumulation of charge carriers at the buried interface. Additionally, the presence of TP&#8208;2D crystal seed has a positive effect on the crystallization process of the upper perovskite film, leading to optimized crystal quality and thus promoted charge transport inside bulk perovskites. Ultimately, the best performing PSCs based on TP&#8208;2D layer deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.58%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4% of their initial PCEs being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8201;h in air. Our findings reveal how to regulate the charge transport dynamics of perovskite bulk and interface by introducing homogeneous components.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation by Co (II) Ion of Optical Activities of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified Chiral Copper Nanoclusters for Sensitive Adenosine Triphosphate Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral nanoscale enantiomers exhibit different biological effects in living systems. However, their chirality effect on the detection sensitivity for chiral biological targets still needs to be explored. Here, we discovered that Co2+ can modulate the luminescence performance of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified copper nanoclusters (L/D&#8208;Cu NCs) and induce strong chiroptical activities as the asymmetric factor was enhanced 223&#8208;fold with their distribution regulating from the ultraviolet to visible region. One Co2+ coordinated with two GSH molecules that modified on the surface of Cu NCs in the way of CoN2O2. On this basis, dual&#8208;modal chiral and luminescent signals of Co2+ coordinated L/D&#8208;Cu NCs (L/D&#8208;Co&#8208;Cu NCs) were used to detect the chiral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) based on the competitive interaction between surficial GSH and ATP molecules with Co2+. The limits of detection of ATP obtained with fluorescence and circular dichroism intensity were 9.15 &#956;M and 15.75 nM for L&#8208;Co&#8208;Cu NCs, and 5.35 &#956;M and 4.69 nM for D&#8208;Co&#8208;Cu NCs. This demonstrated that selecting suitable chiral configurations of nanoprobes effectively enhances detection sensitivity. This study presents not only a novel method to modulate and enhance the chiroptical activity of nanomaterials but also a unique perspective of chirality effects on the detection performances for bio&#8208;targets.</dc:description>

Solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes are applied in metal&#8208;air batteries, introducing dual&#8208;air batteries for intrinsic safe energy storage. In their Research Article (e202318369), Xiaodong Chen and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that fire&#8208;tolerant batteries are achieved, and reveal that the highest tolerance temperature of electrolytes is determined by solute intramolecular bonds instead of solvent intermolecular interactions, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes for their thermal stability.

         <title>Back Cover: Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and Emission on Recovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the sunlight (oil phase), the Morning Stars (the Ag29 nanoclusters) shine brightly, but when night falls (aqueous phase transfer), the stars may lose their luster (photoluminescence quenching). Yet, there are always some special stars. When they come together (supramolecular recoupling), they become the shining Big Dipper (emission recovery) for guiding the direction (downstream hydrophilic applications). Details of the research are reported by Xi Kang, Wenxiong Shi, Manzhou Zhu et&#8197;al. (e202317995).

         <title>A Universal and Programmable Platform based on Fluorescent Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Probes for Detection of Proteins in Organelles of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing protein analysis in organelles of living cells is of great significance for developing diagnostic and therapeutic methods of diseases. Fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies with well imaging performance and high affinity are classical biochemical tools for protein analysis, while due to the inability to effectively enter into cells, not to mention organelles and the uncontrollable reaction sites that might cause antibodies inactivation when chemically modification, they are hard to apply to living cells. Inspired by the structure of fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies, we designed as a universal detection platform that was based on the peptide&#8208;conjugated probes (PCPs) and consisted of three parts: a) a rotor type fluorescent molecular scaffold for conjugation and signal output; b) the cell penetration protein recognition unit; c) the subcellular organelle targeting unit. In living cells, PCPs could firstly localize at organelles and then proceed protein specific recognition, thus jointly leading to the restriction of twisted intramolecular charge transfer and activation of fluorescence signal. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, six different proteins in three typical intracellular organelles could be detected by our platform through simply replacing the recognition sequence of proteins and matching organelle targeting units. The position and intensity of fluorescence signals demonstrated specificity of PCPs and universality of the platform.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable One&#8208;coordinate Lead(I) Radical with Strong g&#8208;Factor Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;based radicals in the oxidation state of +1 are elusive species and are highly challenging to isolate in the condensed phase. In this study, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first isolable free plumbylyne radical 2 bearing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb(I) atom. It reacts with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to afford a two&#8208;coordinate NHC&#8208;ligated Pb(I) radical 3. 2 and 3 represent the first isolable Pb(I)&#8208;based radicals. Theoretical calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the unpaired electron mainly resides at the Pb 6p orbital in both radicals. Owing to the unique one&#8208;coordinate nature of the Pb atom in 2, it possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, and exhibits hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy (gx,y,z = 1.496, 1.166, 0.683) amongst main group radicals. Preliminary investigations into the reactivity of 2 unveiled its Pb&#8208;centered radical nature, and plumbylenes were isolated as products.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Birch Reduction with Low Reactive Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reduction and similar dissolved metal&#8208;type transformations hold significant importance in the organic synthesis toolbox. Historically, the field has been dominated by alkali metal reductants. In this study, we report that largely neglected, low&#8208;reactive alkaline earth metals can become powerful and affordable reductants when used in a ball mill under essentially solvent&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of ethylenediamine and THF as liquid additives. Calcium can reduce both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich arenes, with yields of products similar to those obtained with lithium metal. Magnesium reveals enhanced reducing power, enabling the reduction of benzoic acids while keeping electron&#8208;rich aromatic moieties intact and allows for chemoselective transformations. The developed mechanochemical approach uses readily available and safer&#8208;to&#8208;handle metals, operates under air and ambient temperature conditions, and can be used for gram&#8208;scale preparations. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed conditions can be used for other dissolved metal&#8208;type reductive transformations, including reductive amination, deoxygenation, dehalogenation, alkene and alkyne reductions.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free preparation for efficient and photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (TSC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its potential to breakthrough the theoretical efficiency set for single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) designed as its top component cell suffers from severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation owing to its mixed&#8208;halide strategy for achieving desirable wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68 eV). Developing pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites is a promising route to fabricate photostable perovskite/silicon TSCs. Here, we report efficient and photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique. The ASF process is achieved by mixing two precursor solutions, both of which are capable of depositing corresponding perovskite films without involving anti&#8208;solvent. The mixed solution finally forms Cs0.3DMA0.2MA0.5PbI3 perovskite film with a bandgap of 1.68 eV. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride additive is applied to enhance the crystallinity and reduce the trap density of perovskite films. As a result, the pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers efficiency as high as 21.30% with excellent photostability, the highest for this type of solar cells. The ASF method significantly improves the device reproducibility as compared with devices made from other anti&#8208;solvent methods. Our findings provide a novel recipe to prepare efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Anode/Electrolyte Interfaces Coupled with Regulated Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Term and Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) show a great potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high safety and high energy density. However, the severe side reactions of zinc negative electrode largely hinder the further application of AZIBs. Herein, trace tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) additive with rich lone&#8208;pair&#8208;electrons and zincophilic sites is firstly introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, Tris not only regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also is vertically adsorbed on the Zn anode surface with a changed coordination intensity during the plating/stripping process of Zn to in situ generate a dynamic adsorption layer for the first time. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract the solvated Zn2+ and then promote the de&#8208;solvation of the solvated Zn2+ owing to the orientation polarization with regularly&#8208;changed applied electric field, the volume rejection effect, and strong intermolecular force towards H2O of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris. Therefore, an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport dynamics as well as the inhibition of side reactions of Zn anode are well realized. Accordingly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell provides an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 2600 h.

However, the severe side reactions of zinc negative electrode largely hinder the further application of AZIBs. Herein, trace tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) additive with rich lone-pair-electrons and zincophilic sites is firstly introduced to achieve long-term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, Tris not only regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also is vertically adsorbed on the Zn anode surface with a changed coordination intensity during the plating/stripping process of Zn to in situ generate a dynamic adsorption layer for the first time. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract the solvated Zn2+ and then promote the de-solvation of the solvated Zn2+ owing to the orientation polarization with regularly-changed applied electric field, the volume rejection effect, and strong intermolecular force towards H2O of the vertically-adsorbed Tris. Therefore, an improved Zn2+-transport dynamics as well as the inhibition of side reactions of Zn anode are well realized. Accordingly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell provides an ultra-long cycle life of 2600 h. Furthermore, the Zn||MnO2 full cell with Tris could demonstrate a high capacity and structural stability for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>(111) Facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg Intermetallic Compound with Cu3&#8208;Mg Sites for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient ethanol electrosynthesis from CO2 is challenging with low selectivity at high CO2 electrolysis rates, due to the competition with H2 and other reduction products. Copper&#8208;based bimetallic electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion, but the secondary metal has mainly been focused on active components (such as Ag, Sn) for CO2 electroreduction, which also promote selectivity of ethylene or other reduction products rather than ethanol. Limited attention has been given to alkali&#8208;earth metals due to their inherently active chemical property. Herein, we rationally synthesized a (111) facets&#8208;oriented nano Cu2Mg (designated as Cu2Mg(111)) intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites. The in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculations revealed that the Cu3&#7839;&#8722;&#8208;Mg&#7839;+ active sites allowed to increase *CO surface coverage, decrease reaction energy for *CO&#8211;CO coupling, and stabilize the *CHCHOH intermediates, thus promoting the ethanol formation pathway. The Cu2Mg(111) catalyst showed a high FEC2H5OH of 76.2 &#177; 4.8% at 600 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, and a peak value of |jC2H5OH| of 720 &#177; 34 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, almost 4 times of that using conventional Cu2Mg with (311) facets, comparable to the best reported values for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Donating Conjugation Effect Modulated Zn2+ Reduction Reaction for Separator&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) are attracting extensive attention due to the low cost, high capacity,&#160; and environmental benignity of the zinc anode. However, their application is still hindered by the undesired&#160; zinc dendrites. Despite Zn&#8208;surface modification being promising in relieving dendrites, a thick separator (i.e. glass fibre, 250&#8208;700 &#181;m) is still required to resist dendrite puncture, which limits&#160; volumetric energy density of battery. Here, we pivot from the traditional interphase plus extra separator categories, proposing an all&#8208;in&#8208;one ligand buffer layer (ca. 20 &#956;m) to effectively modulate the Zn2+ transfer and deposition behaviors proved by in&#8208;situ electrochemical digital holography. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory simulations further reveal that the catechol groups in the buffer layer can accelerate the Zn2+ reduction reaction (ZRR) through the electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;&#960; conjugation effect, decreasing the negative charge in the coordination environment. Without extra separators, the elaborated system endows low polarization below 28.2 mV, long lifespan of 4950 h at 5 mA cm&#8210;2 in symmetric batteries, and an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 99.2 Wh L&#8210;1 based on the whole pouch cells. The concomitantly &#8220;separator&#8208;free&#8221; and &#8220;dendrite&#8208;free&#8221; conjugation effect with an accelerated ZRR process could foster the progression of metallic anodes and benefit energetic aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipolar Chemical Bridge Induced CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with 21.86% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CsPbI3 perovskite receives tremendous attention for photovoltaic applications due to its ideal bandgap and good thermal stability. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly suffer from photovoltage deficits because of serious interfacial energy losses within the PSCs, which to a large extent affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Herein, a dipolar chemical bridge (DCB) is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower interfacial energy losses and thus improve the charge extraction of PSCs. The results reveal that the DCB could form a beneficial interfacial dipole between the perovskite and TiO2 layers, which could optimize the interfacial energetics of perovskite/TiO2 layers and thus improve the energy level alignment within the PSCs. Meanwhile, the constructed DCB could also simultaneously passivate the surface defects of perovskite and TiO2 layers, greatly lowering interfacial recombination. Consequently, the photovoltage deficit of PSCs is largely reduced, leading to a record efficiency of 21.86% being realized. Meanwhile, the operation stability of PSCs is also largely improved due to the high&#8208;quality perovskite films with released interfacial tensile strain being obtained after forming the DCB within the PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Accessibility of Internal Catalytic Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks by Introducing a Bicontinuous Mesostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure were synthesized through a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided nanocasting method. The bicontinuous architecture enables efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal regions of the COFs, leading to high accessibility of their active catalytic sites and excellent NO removal capability.







Abstract
Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly&#8208;guided nanocasting strategy. Three different mesostructured COFs are synthesized, including two covalent triazine frameworks and one vinylene&#8208;linked COF. The new materials are endowed with a hierarchical meso/microporous architecture, in which the mesochannels exhibit an ordered shifted double diamond (SDD) topology. The hierarchically porous structure can enable efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal of the COFs and consequently high accessibility of their active catalytic sites. Benefiting from this hierarchical structure, these COFs exhibit excellent performance in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic NO removal with a high conversion percentage of up to 51.4&#8201;%, placing them one of the top reported NO&#8208;elimination photocatalysts. This study represents the first case of introducing a bicontinuous structure into COFs, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of hierarchically porous COFs and for increasing the utilization degree of their internal active sites.

&lt;p&gt;Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self-assembly-guided nanocasting strategy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Overcoming Thermal Quenching in X&#8208;ray Scintillators through Multi&#8208;excited State Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray scintillators have gained significant attention in medical diagnostics and industrial applications. Despite their widespread utility, scintillator development faces a significant hurdle when exposed to elevated temperatures, as it usually results in reduced scintillation efficiency and diminished luminescence output. Here we report a molecular design strategy based on a hybrid perovskite (TpyBiCl5) that overcomes thermal quenching through multi&#8208;excited state switching. The structure of perovskite provides a platform to modulate the luminescence centers. The rigid framework constructed by this perovskite structure stabilized its triplet states, resulting in TpyBiCl5 exhibiting an approximately 12 times higher (45% vs. 3.8%) photoluminescence quantum yield of room temperature phosphorescence than that of its organic ligand (Tpy). Most importantly, the interactions between the components of this perovskite enable the mixing of different excited states, which has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations. The TpyBiCl5 scintillator exhibits a detection limit of 38.92 nGy s&#8208;1 at 213K and a detection limit of 196.31 nGy s&#8208;1 at 353 K through scintillation mode switching between thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. This work opens up the possibility of solving the thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray scintillators by tuning different excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Attenuating N&#8208;oxyl Decomposition for Improved Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of N&#8208;oxyl hydrogen atom transfer catalysts has proven challenging to date. Previous efforts have focused on the functionalization of the archetype phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl. Driven in part by the limited options for modification of this structure, this strategy has provided only modest improvement in reactivity and/or solubility. Our previous mechanistic efforts have suggested that while the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyls of the phthalimide are necessary to maximize the O&#8208;H bond dissociation enthalpy of the HAT product hydroxylamine and thus overall reaction thermodynamics, they can undergo nucleophilic substitution leading to catalyst decomposition. In an attempt to minimize this vulnerability, this work replaces the aryl ring in PINO with the combination of a substituted heteroatom and quaternary carbon. By rendering one carbonyl carbon less electrophilic and the other less sterically accessible, the corresponding N1&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydantoin&#8208;N3&#8208;oxyl showed significantly higher stability than PINO as well as a modest improvement in reactivity. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in new scaffold design may accelerate future HAT catalyst discovery and development.</dc:description>

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free Pyrene&#8208;based Hole Transporting Material Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is significant to the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we developed a novel star&#8208;shape arylamine HTM, termed Py&#8208;DB, with a pyrene core and carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as the bridge units. Compared to the reference HTM (termed Py&#8208;C), the extension of the planar conjugation backbone endows Py&#8208;DB with typical intermolecular p&#8208;p stacking interactions and excellent solubility, resulting in improved hole mobility and film morphology. In addition, the lower HOMO energy level of the Py&#8208;DB HTM provides efficient hole extraction with reduced energy loss at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.33% was achieved for dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based PSCs, which is the highest PCEs for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTM in n&#8208;i&#8208;p configured PSCs. The dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based device also exhibits improved long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h exposure to 25% humidity at 60 &#176;C. These findings provide valuable insights and approaches for the further development of dopant&#8208;free HTMs for efficient and reliable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nonbenzenoid Heteroacene Crystals Synthesized via In&#8208;Situ Embedding of Ladder Bipyrazinylenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals are synthesized via the in&#8208;situ embedding of ladder bipyrazinylenes (LBPys) on Au(111). Through the intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and give rise to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Precisely introducing topological defects is an important strategy in nanographene crystal engineering because defects can tune &#960;&#8208;electronic structures and control molecular assemblies. The synergistic control of the synthesis and assembly of nanographenes by embedding the topological defects to afford two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals on surfaces is still a great challenge. By in&#8208;situ embedding ladder bipyrazinylene (LBPy) into acene, the narrowest nanographene with zigzag edges, we have achieved the precise preparation of 2D nonbenzenoid heteroacene crystals on Au(111). Through intramolecular electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides and Au adatom&#8208;directed [2+2] cycloaddition, the nonbenzenoid heteroacene products are produced with high chemoselectivity, and lead to the molecular 2D assembly via LBPy&#8208;derived interlocking hydrogen bonds. Using bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we determined the atomic structures of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene product and diverse organometallic intermediates. The tunneling spectroscopy measurements revealed the electronic structure of the nonbenzenoid heteroacene, which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed distinct organometallic intermediates during progression annealing combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that LBPy formation proceeds via electrocyclization of o&#8208;diisocyanides, trapping of heteroarynes by Au adatoms, and stepwise elimination of Au adatoms.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hexa&#8208;Substituted Carpyridines into 1D Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recently introduced saddle&#8208;shaped supramolecular unit &#8220;carpyridine&#8221;, which strongly relies on aromatic curvature to self&#8208;assemble, was engineered to form 1D supramolecular polymers. This modified mode of assembly allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the process, including enthalpy values comparable to those of hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems. The minimalism of the molecular design showcases the versatility of curvature in molecular design.







Abstract
The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle&#8208;shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding classical unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well&#8208;established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self&#8208;assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.

&lt;p&gt;A recently introduced saddle-shaped supramolecular unit &#8220;carpyridine&#8221;, which strongly relies on aromatic curvature to self-assemble, was engineered to form 1D supramolecular polymers. This modified mode of assembly allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the process, including enthalpy values comparable to those of hydrogen-bonded systems. The minimalism of the molecular design showcases the versatility of curvature in molecular design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self-assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle-shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding &lt;i&gt;classical&lt;/i&gt; unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well-established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self-assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self-assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non-covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two simple structure and highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks (CNPz and DCNPz) were synthesized and incorporated into polymer backbone. P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show unipolar electron mobilities of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in OTFTs, respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, these two polymers exhibit electrical conductivities and power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is essential to accelerate the application of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). To achieve this objective, it is critical to design strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with simple structure and easy synthesis, which are essential for the development of n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Herein, we synthesized two cyano&#8208;functionalized highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 3,6&#8208;dibromopyrazine&#8208;2&#8208;carbonitrile (CNPz) and 3,6&#8208;Dibromopyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile (DCNPz), which feature simple structures and facile synthesis. CNPz and DCNPz can be obtained via only one&#8208;step reaction and three&#8208;step reactions from cheap raw materials, respectively. Based on CNPz and DCNPz, two acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) polymers, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) are successfully developed, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, which are beneficial to n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and OTEs performance. An optimal unipolar electron mobility of 0.85 and 1.85&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is obtained for P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz), respectively. When doped with N&#8208;DMBI, P(DPP&#8208;CNPz) and P(DPP&#8208;DCNPz) show high n&#8208;type electrical conductivities/power factors of 25.3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/41.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, and 33.9&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1/30.4&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, respectively. Hence, the cyano&#8208;functionalized pyrazine CNPz and DCNPz represent a new class of structurally simple, low&#8208;cost and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient building block for constructing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Resolving the Origins of Superior Cycling Performance of Antimony Anode in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Comparison with Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic comparative study on the electrochemical performance and dynamic microstructural and mechanical changes of antimony anode in storing Li+/Na+ cations was carried out by combining in situ microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, density functional theory simulations, and finite&#8208;element analysis. Full stepwise crystal transition with large lattice strains has been witnessed in Li&#8208;storage system, while an unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/de&#8208;alloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as intermediates is discovered in Na&#8208;storage system, featuring enhanced resilience and less strain, contributing to high capacities and superior cyclability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type antimony (Sb) with high theoretical capacity is a promising anode candidate for both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Given the larger radius of Na+ (1.02&#8197;&#197;) than Li+ (0.76&#8197;&#197;), it was generally believed that the Sb anode would experience even worse capacity degradation in SIBs due to more substantial volumetric variations during cycling when compared to LIBs. However, the Sb anode in SIBs unexpectedly exhibited both better electrochemical and structural stability than in LIBs, and the mechanistic reasons that underlie this performance discrepancy remain undiscovered. Here, using substantial in situ transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman techniques complemented by theoretical simulations, we explicitly reveal that compared to the lithiation/delithiation process, sodiation/desodiation process of Sb anode displays a previously unexplored two&#8208;stage alloying/dealloying mechanism with polycrystalline and amorphous phases as the intermediates featuring improved resilience to mechanical damage, contributing to superior cycling stability in SIBs. Additionally, the better mechanical properties and weaker atomic interaction of Na&#8722;Sb alloys than Li&#8722;Sb alloys favor enabling mitigated mechanical stress, accounting for enhanced structural stability as unveiled by theoretical simulations. Our finding delineates the mechanistic origins of enhanced cycling stability of Sb anode in SIBs with potential implications for other large&#8208;volume&#8208;change electrode materials.

Co&#8208;aggregation of tetrazine molecules and fluorophores serves as a simple, fast, and convenient strategy for preparing fluorogenic nanoprobes. The obtained coaggregates show bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity with a broad selection of emission spectra. This report highlights the molecular design principles and detailed protocols for achieving this &#8220;just mix&#8221; approach.







Abstract
Life science has progressed with applications of fluorescent probes&#8212;fluorophores linked to functional units responding to biological events. To meet the varied demands across experiments, simple organic reactions to connect fluorophores and functional units have been developed, enabling the on&#8208;demand selection of fluorophore&#8208;functional unit combinations. However, organic synthesis requires professional equipment and skills, standing as a daunting task for life scientists. In this study, we present a simple, fast, and convenient strategy for probe preparation: co&#8208;aggregation of hydrophobic molecules. We focused on tetrazine&#8212;a difficult&#8208;to&#8208;prepare yet useful functional unit that provides effective bioorthogonal reactivity and strong fluorogenicity. Simply mixing the tetrazine molecules and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens in water, co&#8208;aggregation is induced, and the emission of AIE luminogens is quenched. Subsequent click reaction bioorthogonally turns on the emission, identifying these coaggregates as fluorogenic probes. Thanks to this bioorthogonal fluorogenicity, we established a new time&#8208;gated fluorescence bioimaging technique to distinguish overlapping emission signals, enabling multi&#8208;organelle imaging with two same&#8208;color fluorophores. Our study showcases the potential of this co&#8208;aggregation method for the on&#8208;demand preparation of fluorescent probes as well as protocols and molecular design principles in this approach, offering an effective solution to evolving needs in life science research.

         <title>Transcytosis&#8208;Based Renal Tubular Reabsorption of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a smart surface mimic strategy for exogenous ultrasmall gold nanoparticles to construct protein mimics (P&#8722;AuNPs) and demonstrated that the P&#8722;AuNPs were identical to the endogenous filterable proteins not only in appearance but also in transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption. This surface&#8208;mimicking strategy can stimulate further investigation into many other endogenous metabolic pathways for exogenous substances.







Abstract
Transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of endogenous proteins is a well&#8208;known energy&#8208;saving pathway that prevents nutrient loss. However, utilization of this well&#8208;known reabsorption pathway for the delivery of exogenous nanodrugs remains a challenge. In this study, using the surface mimic strategy of a specific PEPT1/2&#8208;targeted Gly&#8722;Sar peptide as a ligand, renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (P&#8722;AuNPs) were developed as protein mimics to investigate the transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of exogenous substances. By regulating the influential factors (H+ content in tubular lumens and PEPT1/2 transporter counts in tubular cells) of Gly&#8722;Sar&#8208;mediated transcytosis, the specific and efficient interaction between P&#8722;AuNPs and renal tubular cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Efficient transcellular transportation significantly guided the reabsorption of P&#8722;AuNPs back into the bloodstream, which enhanced the blood concentration and bioavailability of nanoparticles, contributing to high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging.

         <title>Enhanced Charge Carrier Dynamics on Sb2Se3 Photocathodes for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photoelectrochemical ammonia production from NO3 reduction reaction can be achieved by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency of 88.01&#8201;% and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. It provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is recognized as a transportable carrier for renewable energy fuels. Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) offers a sustainable solution for nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater treatment by directly converting solar energy to ammonia. In this study, we demonstrate the highly selective PEC ammonia production from NO3RR by constructing a CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode. The constructed CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode achieves an ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) of 88.01&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;VRHE and an ammonia yield as high as 15.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3&#8197;VRHE with an excellent onset potential of 0.43&#8197;VRHE. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3 photocathode possesses high light absorption capacity, excellent carrier transfer capability, and high charge separation and transfer efficiencies. The photocathode can effectively adsorb the reactant NO3&#8722; and intermediate, and the CoCu co&#8208;catalyst increases the maximum Gibbs free energy difference between NO3RR and HER. Meanwhile, the Co species enhances the spin density of Cu, and increases the density of states near the Fermi level in pdos, which results in a high PEC NO3RR activity on CoCu/TiO2/Sb2Se3. This work provides a new avenue for the feasibility of efficient PEC ammonia synthesis from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>Consumer Grade Polyethylene Recycling via Hydrogenolysis on Ultrafine Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium particles of &#8764;1&#8197;nm supported on titania achieved via hydrogenolysis up to 80&#8201;% conversion of HDPE used in bottle caps into light alkanes at mild conditions and showed reusability. General selectivity trends were disclosed across HDPE types. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as reaction progresses, nuanced by HDPE type.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenolysis has the potential to convert high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), which comprises about 30&#8201;% of plastic waste, into valuable alkanes. Most investigations have focused on increasing activity for lab grade HDPEs displaying low molecular weight, with limited mechanistic understanding of the product distribution. No efficient catalyst is available for consumer grades due to their lower reactivity. This study targets HDPE used in bottle caps, a waste form generated globally at a rate of approximately one million units per hour. Ultrafine ruthenium particles (1&#8197;nm) supported on titania (anatase) achieved up to 80&#8201;% conversion into light alkanes (C1&#8722;C45) under mild conditions (498&#8197;K, 20&#8197;bar H2, 4&#8197;h) and were reused for three cycles. Small ruthenium nanoparticles were critical to achieving relevant conversions, as activity sharply decreased with particle size. Selectivity commonalities and peculiarities across HDPE grades were disclosed by a reaction modelling approach applied to products. Isomerization cedes to backbone scission as the reaction progresses. Within this trend, low molecular weight favor isomerization whilst high molecular weight favor cleavage. Commercial caps obeyed this trend with decreased activity, anticipating the influence of additives in realistic processing. This study demonstrates effective hydrogenolysis of consumer grade polyethylene and provides selectivity patterns for product control.

         <title>Synthetic Biology&#8208;based Construction of Unnatural Perylenequinones with Improved Photodynamic Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unnatural perylenequinone cercosporin A is obtained by reprogramming cercosporin assembly line in Cercospora, which displays low dark toxicity and high photostability and maintains great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it shows selective accumulation in cancer cells. Thus, this work provides a remarkable concept for preparing unnatural products with the desired functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies.







Abstract
The construction of structural complexity and diversity of natural products is crucial for drug discovery and development. To overcome high dark toxicity and poor photostability of natural photosensitizer perylenequinones (PQs) for photodynamic therapy, herein, we aim to introduce the structural complexity and diversity to biosynthesize the desired unnatural PQs in fungus Cercospora through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Thus, we first elucidate the intricate biosynthetic pathways of class B PQs and reveal how the branching enzymes create their structural complexity and diversity from a common ancestor. This enables the rational reprogramming of cercosporin biosynthetic pathway in Cercospora to generate diverse unnatural PQs without chemical modification. Among them, unnatural cercosporin A displays remarkably low dark toxicity and high photostability with retention of great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, it is found that, unlike cercosporin, unnatural cercosporin A could be selectively accumulated in cancer cells, providing potential targets for drug development. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for preparing unnatural products with customized functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies, thus facilitating drug discovery pipelines from nature.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion through Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological phase transition, mediated by oxygen vacancies, is discovered in free&#8208;standing Ni&#8208;Co oxides supported on graphene aerogel. This phase transition introduces NiCoO2/NiCo2O4 heterojunction in the surface region, thus improving the catalytic activity thanks to a strong internal electric field and gradient oxygen vacancies. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 and desorption of *CO intermediates, resulting in an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Weak adsorption of gas reactants and strong binding of intermediates present a significant challenge for most transition metal oxides, particularly in the realm of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we demonstrate that the adsorption can be fine&#8208;tuned by phase engineering of oxide catalysts. An oxygen vacancy mediated topological phase transition in Ni&#8208;Co oxide nanowires, supported on a hierarchical graphene aerogel (GA), is observed from a spinel phase to a rock&#8208;salt phase. Such in situ phase transition empowers the Ni&#8208;Co oxide catalyst with a strong internal electric field and the attainment of abundant oxygen vacancies. Among a series of catalysts, the in situ transformed spinel/rock&#8208;salt heterojunction supported on GA stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and selectivity, yielding an impressive CO production rate of 12.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 96.5&#8201;%. This remarkable performance is a result of the robust interfacial coupling between two topological phases that optimizes the electronic structures through directional charge transfer across interfaces. The phase transition process induces more Co2+ in octahedral site, which can effectively enhance the Co&#8208;O covalency. This synergistic effect balances the surface activation of CO2 molecules and desorption of reaction intermediates, thereby lowering the energetic barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Identification of Direct Anchoring Sites for Monoatomic Dispersion of Precious Metals (Pt, Pd, Ag) on CeO2 Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface of the reducible support (CeO2), rather than the defects on the surface, are the direct anchoring sites of active metals. Therefore, active metals (Ag, Pt and Pd, etc.) can be single&#8208;atom dispersed on the terminal hydroxyl&#8208;rich CeO2&#8722;NC support (CeO2 (100) surfaces).







Abstract
Monoatomic dispersion of precious metals on the surface of CeO2 nanocrystals is a highly practical approach for dramatically reducing the usage of precious metals while exploiting the unique properties of single&#8208;atom catalysts. However, the specific atomic sites for anchoring precious metal atoms on the CeO2 support and underlying chemical mechanism remain partially unknown. Herein, we show that the terminal hydroxyls on the (100) surface are the most stable sites for anchoring Ag atoms on CeO2, indicating that CeO2 nanocubes are the most efficient substrates to achieve monoatomic dispersion of Ag. Importantly, the newly identified chemical mechanism for single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom dispersion on CeO2 nanocubes appears to be generic and can thus be extended to other precious metals (Pt and Pd). In fact, our experiments also show that atomically dispersed Pt/Pd species exhibit morphology&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent CO selectivity in the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
mMB, as a novel self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecule enabling photon sensitization, chemical defect formation, and afterglow generation, possessed a NIR afterglow chemiluminescence with a higher brightness and a NIR fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic signal. By introducing a responsive unit on the phenothiazine ring, it was tailored for ultrasensitive imaging of biomarkers with a superior activation ratio, enabling in vivo versatile imaging with high SBRs.







Abstract
Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8208;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710&#8197;nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8208;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8208;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30&#8197;min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Ultrastrong Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Uranium&#8208;Organic Frameworks Leading to Inverse Luminescence Temperature Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consistent, crystalline, and oriented uranium&#8208;based MOF thin film was devised by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique. The materials exhibited a noticeable phonon&#8208;assisted temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and presented two unusual thermal&#8208;activated emission bands (&#8220;hot&#8208;band&#8221;). A single&#8208;metal ratiometric optical thermometer was designed relying on this uranium&#8208;based MOF thin films and it exhibited exceptional thermal sensitivity.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;phonon interactions, crucial in condensed matter, are rarely seen in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Detecting these interactions typically involves analyzing luminescence in lanthanide&#8208; or actinide&#8208;based compounds. Prior studies on Ln&#8208; and Ac&#8208;based MOFs at high temperatures revealed additional peaks, but these were too faint for thorough analysis. In our research, we fabricated a high&#8208;quality, crystalline uranium&#8208;based MOF (KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1) thin film using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. Under UV light, this film showed two distinct &#8220;hot bands,&#8221; indicating a strong electron&#8208;phonon interaction. At 77&#8197;K, these bands were absent, but at 300&#8197;K, a new emission band appeared with half the intensity of the main luminescence. Surprisingly, a second hot band emerged above 320&#8197;K, deviating from previous findings in rare&#8208;earth compounds. We conducted a detailed ab&#8208;initio analysis employing time&#8208;dependent density functional theory to understand this unusual behaviour and to identify the lattice vibration responsible for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The KIT&#8208;U&#8208;1 film's hot&#8208;band emission was then utilized to create a highly sensitive, single&#8208;compound optical thermometer. This underscores the potential of high&#8208;quality MOF thin films in exploiting the unique luminescence of lanthanides and actinides for advanced applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4&#8208;C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.







Abstract
Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs).

&lt;p&gt;A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4-C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reaction&#8208;Enabled Chloride Modification on CsPbI3 Quantum Dots for Pure Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 26&#8201;%</title>

Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with a carrier&#8208;confined structure of CsPbI3/PbClx are demonstrated via the nucleophilic reaction during colloidal synthesis. The modification of a PbClx surface outside the CsPbI3 QDs regulates the exciton recombination, enabling high&#8208;performance pure red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, and superior operation stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance pure red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an emission wavelength shorter than 650&#8197;nm are ideal for wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays, yet remain an unprecedented challenge to progress. Mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 emitter&#8208;based PeLEDs suffer spectral stability induced by halide phase segregation and CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) suffer from a compromise between emission wavelength and electroluminescence efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient pure red PeLEDs with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs. A nucleophilic reaction that releases chloride ions and manipulates the ligand equilibrium of the colloidal system is developed to synthesize the pure red emission QDs. The comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterizations evidence the formation of PbClx outside the CsPbI3 QDs, which regulates exciton recombination and prevents the exciton from dissociation induced by surface defects. In consequence, PeLEDs based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs with superior optoelectronic properties demonstrate stable electroluminescence spectra at high driving voltages, a record external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, optimal efficiency roll&#8208;off of 16.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and a half lifetime of 7.5&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs. This work provides new insight into constructing the carrier&#8208;confined structure on perovskite QDs for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Sulfonated Perylene as Three&#8208;in&#8208;One STING Agonist for Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study states that sulfonated perylene can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist that not only promotes the production of endogenous cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) but also inhibits its hydrolysis as well as achieves lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and hence presents an innovative platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has been considered as a powerful immunotherapy strategy. While promising, the clinical translation of CDNs is still overwhelmed by its limited biostability and the resulting systemic immunotoxicity. Being differentiating from current application of exogenous CDNs to address these challenges, we herein developed one perylene STING agonist PDIC&#8208;NS, which not only promotes the production of endogenous CDNs but also inhibits its hydrolysis. More significantly, PDIC&#8208;NS can well reach lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and thus mitigates the systemic immunotoxicity upon intravenous administration. As a result, PDIC&#8208;NS had realized remarkable in vivo antitumor activity, and backward verified on STING knock out mice. Overall, this study states that PDIC&#8208;NS can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecule STING agonist characterized by promoting the content and biostability of endogenous CDNs as well as possessing good tissue specificity, and hence presents an innovative strategy and platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;nanometer long iridium&#8208;cornered metallorectangle was obtained and used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of planar guests. This slit&#8208;shaped metallobox is able to form host&#8211;guest complexes with a variety of planar molecules, which slide from one side of the cavity to the other, with a large amplitude motion that was experimentally quantified.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.

         <title>Ground&#8208;State Orbital Descriptors for Accelerated Development of Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work built a machine learning&#8208;aided classifier for phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;p) based on ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors derived from &#960;&#8208;electron in the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), balancing screening efficiency and accuracy of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. With the aid of excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 RTP candidates were screened from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules.







Abstract
Organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are in high demand for optoelectronics and bioelectronics. Developing RTP materials highly relies on expert experience and costly excited&#8208;state calculations. It is a challenge to find a tool for effectively screening RTP materials. Herein we first establish ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors (&#960;FMOs) derived from the &#960;&#8208;electron component of the frontier molecular orbitals to characterize the RTP lifetime (&#964;p), achieving a balance in screening efficiency and accuracy. Using the &#960;FMOs, a data&#8208;driven machine learning model gains a high accuracy in classifying long &#964;p, filtering out 836 candidates with long&#8208;lived RTP from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules. With the aid of the excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 compounds are predicted with high RTP efficiency. Impressively, experiments further confirm the reliability of this workflow, opening a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance RTP materials for potential applications.

Herein we first establish ground-state orbital descriptors (&#960;&lt;sub&gt;FMOs&lt;/sub&gt;) derived from the &#960;-electron component of the frontier molecular orbitals to characterize the RTP lifetime (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving a balance in screening efficiency and accuracy. Using the &#960;&lt;sub&gt;FMOs&lt;/sub&gt;, a data-driven machine learning model gains a high accuracy in classifying long &#964;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, filtering out 836 candidates with long-lived RTP from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules. With the aid of the excited-state calculations, 287 compounds are predicted with high RTP efficiency. Impressively, experiments further confirm the reliability of this workflow, opening a novel avenue for designing high-performance RTP materials for potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a strategy of organic&#8208;air batteries which is assembled with organic material as anode directly instead of the traditional metal&#8208;air batteries. Organic N&#8208;heterocycle compounds (NHCC) were synthesized and used as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept anode materials, which exhibits a low redox potential of &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO. Coupling with a 4&#8197;M KOH+10&#8197;M KCF3SO3 electrolyte, the NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries exhibited a high voltage of 1.6&#8197;V and life time of 30,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0&#8197;M KOH+10.0&#8197;M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3&#8197;V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000&#8197;cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) was developed to achieve dense zinc deposition and broken side&#8208;reaction loops in the Zn//V2O5 system simultaneously.







Abstract
The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8722;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500&#8197;h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000&#8197;cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028&#8201;% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported a novel molecular strategy to optimize commercial hard carbon (HC). A disodium phthalate (DP) molecule with two Na+ is capable of efficiently replenishing the Na+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation. The as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (&#8776;7.4&#8197;nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8&#8201;%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.3&#8201;% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.

         <title>Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral&#8208;Inspired Method Integrating First&#8208;Principles High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking fresnoite&#8208;type solar&#8208;blind UV nonlinear material, Rb2SbFP2O7, with a shortened UV absorption edge, heightened birefringence, and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response, was successfully designed and synthesized through a mineral&#8208;inspired approach integrating first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering.







Abstract
Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid&#8208;state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often&#8208;overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba2TiOSi2O7. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb2TeOP2O7 and Rb2SbFP2O7. Notably, Rb2SbFP2O7 demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260&#8197;nm) and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.1&#215;KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546&#8197;nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba2TiOSi2O7 (0.005@546&#8197;nm).

     alt="Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral-Inspired Method Integrating First-Principles High-Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking fresnoite-type solar-blind UV nonlinear material, Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbFP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, with a shortened UV absorption edge, heightened birefringence, and a more robust second-harmonic generation response, was successfully designed and synthesized through a mineral-inspired approach integrating first-principles high-throughput screening and crystal engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid-state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first-principles high-throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often-overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiOSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeOP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbFP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbFP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260&#8197;nm) and a more robust second-harmonic generation response (5.1&#215;KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546&#8197;nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiOSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (0.005@546&#8197;nm). Our research has not only revitalized the potential of the fresnoite mineral for the development of new high-performance UV nonlinear optical materials but has also provided a clearly defined roadmap for the efficient exploration of novel structure-driven functional materials with targeted properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate Batteries for Wastewater Refining, Electricity Generation, and Production of Ammonia and Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

We demonstrate a novel multi&#8208;functional formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery, which simultaneously realizes wastewater purification, electricity generation and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3 and formate. This battery exhibits an open&#8208;circuit potential of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For simulated industrial wastewater, 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed and an electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated.







Abstract
As bulky pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater, nitrate and formaldehyde pose serious threats to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies including chemical and bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical methods, are generally high&#8208;cost, time&#8208;consuming, or energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report a novel formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery by pairing anodic formaldehyde oxidation with cathodic nitrate reduction, which simultaneously enables wastewater purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia and formate. As a result, the formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery remarkably exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the yield rates of 32.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ammonia and 889.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formate. In a large&#8208;scale formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery (25&#8197;cm2), 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed from simulated industrial wastewater and the electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated. Moreover, the design of such a multi&#8208;functional battery is universally applicable to the coupling of NO3&#8722; or NO2&#8722; reduction with various aldehyde oxidization, paving a new avenue for wastewater purification and chemical manufacturing.

         <title>For Zinc Metal Batteries, How Many Electrons go to Hydrogen Evolution? An Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry method for precise quantification of hydrogen evolution reactions during zinc electrodeposition. The results show that the magnitude of hydrogen evolution is positively correlated to applied current density.







Abstract
Despite the advantages of aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries (AZMB) like high specific capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 5,854&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), low redox potential (&#8722;0.76&#8197;V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), low cost, water compatibility, and safety, the development of practically relevant batteries is plagued by several issues like unwanted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion of Zn substrate (insulating ZnO, Zn(OH)2, Zn(SO4)x(OH)y, Zn(ClO4)x(OH)y etc. passivation layer), and dendrite growth. Controlling and suppressing HER activity strongly correlates with the long&#8208;term cyclability of AZMBs. Therefore, a precise quantitative technique is needed to monitor the real&#8208;time dynamics of hydrogen evolution during Zn electrodeposition. In this study, we quantify hydrogen evolution using in situ electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS). This methodology enables us to determine a correction factor for the faradaic efficiency of this system with unmatched precision. For instance, during the electrodeposition of zinc on a copper substrate at a current density of 1.5&#8197;mA/cm2 for 600&#8197;seconds, 0.3&#8201;% of the total charge is attributed to HER, while the rest contributes to zinc electrodeposition. At first glance, this may seem like a small fraction, but it can be detrimental to the long&#8208;term cycling performance of AZMBs. Furthermore, our results provide insights into the correlation between HER and the porous morphology of the electrodeposited zinc, unravelling the presence of trapped H2 and Zn corrosion during the charging process. Overall, this study sets a platform to accurately determine the faradaic efficiency of Zn electrodeposition and provides a powerful tool for evaluating electrolyte additives, salts, and electrode modifications aimed at enhancing long&#8208;term stability and suppressing the HER in aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to nanozymes mimicking specific metallocofactors without other supporting cofactors, a metal&#8211;organic framework incorporating multiple nanocofactors demonstrates the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The synergy of the atomic iron sites, linkers and zirconia nodes boosts electron transfer, providing insight into the construction of catalytic pockets at the atomic scale for a deep understanding of nanozyme catalysis.







Abstract
Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)2) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&#8722;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer&#8208;structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&#8722;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn2+ ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8722; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn
Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500&#8197;h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn
Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200&#8197;cycles at ~99.8&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5&#8201;%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn
Br2 battery (~5.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8208;2), cycling over 320&#8197;cycles with 95.3&#8201;% initial capacity retained.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a novel zinc salt (Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with an asymmetric structure anion group DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, to enable a high ionic conductivity and engender in situ formation of a robust layer-structured SEI layer via easy decomposition of the asymmetric DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This robust SEI layer can quickly transfer Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, restrain dendrite growth, and suppress over 90&#8201;% hydrogen production, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic additives with high-reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low-concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;)-based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite-free Zn anode.

         <title>Identification of Cu(111) as Superior Active Sites for Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3 with High Single&#8208;Pass Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visual demonstration of the s&#8208;p and d&#8208;p hybridization states between Cu and N atom in N&#8722;O during the adsorption and activation mechanism of NO molecules is brought. The &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* coordination bond&#8221; formed between N atom and Cu center is the essence of the interaction between the Cu center and NO molecule. The Cu3d electrons occupy the &#960;* orbitals in NO, eventually weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond.







Abstract
Opting for NO as an N source in electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis presents an intriguing approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges. However, blindly pursuing high NH3 synthesis rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE) while ignoring the NO conversion ratio could result in environmental problems. Herein, Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) surface is fabricated and exhibit a NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 yield rate of 371.89&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (flow cell) and the highest FE of 93.19&#177;1.99&#8201;% (H&#8208;type cell). The NO conversion ratio is increased to the current highest value of 63.74&#8201;% combined with the development of the flow cell. Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&#8722;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

A novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system is established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. Benefiting from the strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities of the Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 cathode, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery displays the highest round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.2&#8201;%) to date, superior rate capability, and stable cycle life of over 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32&#8197;V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (&#8776;500&#8197;h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.

We developed an innovative operando plasmon&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry technique for the sensitive detection of interfacial species during electrochemical reactions. This platform is established by plasmonic antennae electrically connected via monolayer graphene and exhibits a remarkable signal enhancement. The enhanced IR features enable the reconstruction of electrochemical curves and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
IR spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;IR) is a cutting&#8208;edge operando method for exploring electrochemical reaction mechanisms. However, detection of interfacial molecules is challenged by the limited sensitivity of existing EC&#8208;IR platforms due to the lack of high&#8208;enhancement substrates. Here, we propose an innovative plasmon&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;PEIRS) platform to overcome this sensitivity limitation. Plasmonic antennae with ultrahigh IR signal enhancement are electrically connected via monolayer graphene while preserving optical path integrity, serving as both the electrode and IR substrate. The [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; redox reaction and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are investigated on the EC&#8208;PEIRS platform with a remarkable signal enhancement. Notably, the enhanced IR signals enable a reconstruction of the electrochemical curve of the redox reactions and unveil the CO2RR mechanism. This study presents a promising technique for boosting the in&#8208;depth understanding of interfacial events across diverse applications.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature synthesis of crystalline Sb3N5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Sb3N5 has been synthesized from the high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature chemical reaction of antimony and nitrogen in a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The Cmc21 structure of Sb3N5, determined by single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, contains two types Sb atoms in octahedral and trigonal prismatic (square antiprismatic) coordination, respectively forming alternated double&#8208; and mono&#8208;layers stacked in the bc plane.







Abstract
A chemical reaction between Sb and N2 was induced under high&#8208;pressure (32&#8211;35&#8197;GPa) and high&#8208;temperature (1600&#8211;2200&#8197;K) conditions, generated by a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The reaction product was identified by single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at 35&#8197;GPa and room temperature as crystalline antimony nitride with Sb3N5 stoichiometry and structure belonging to orthorhombic space group Cmc21. Only Sb&#8722;N bonds are present in the covalent bonding framework, with two types of Sb atoms respectively forming SbN6 distorted octahedra and trigonal prisms and three types of N atoms forming NSb4 distorted tetrahedra and NSb3 trigonal pyramids. Taking into account two longer Sb&#8722;N distances, the SbN6 trigonal prisms can be depicted as SbN8 square antiprisms and the NSb3 trigonal pyramids as NSb4 distorted tetrahedra. The Sb3N5 structure can be described as an ordered stacking in the bc plane of bi&#8208; layers of SbN6 octahedra alternated to monolayers of SbN6 trigonal prisms (SbN8 square antiprisms). The discovery of Sb3N5 finally represents the long sought&#8208;after experimental evidence for Sb to form a crystalline nitride, providing new insights about fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and opening new perspectives for the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of pnictogen nitrides and the synthesis of an entire class of new materials.

         <title>Helitwistacenes&#8212;Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining helicenes with twistacenes, in which the extent of twisting can be tuned, has led to the new family of helitwistacenes. The combination of lateral and longitudinal helicity results in polarity&#8208;induced and twisting&#8208;induced sign inversion of both the electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals. This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.







Abstract
Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable polyimide 2D covalent organic framework (COF), which has abundant lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units within the 1D channels. The COF can serve as an intermediate layer to guide the uniform electrodeposition of lithium ion, leading to the formation of dense and smooth lithium deposition layer in a cylindrical morphology and steady lithium plating/stripping behaviors.







Abstract
The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8722;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which can be well retained up to 400&#8197;cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99&#8201;% at a charge of 0.3&#8197;C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91&#8201;% even after 150&#8197;cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Tip&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Induced Surface Microenvironments Regulation Boosts the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;like FeN4 structures on curved carbon surfaces are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The curved structure induced a strong local electric field and dense interfacial water layer, enhancing the kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The modulated electronic structures of Fe centers facilitate the ORR pathway transition from an associative to a dissociative process.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts with defined local structures and favorable surface microenvironments are significant for overcoming slow kinetics and accelerating O2 electroreduction. Here, enriched tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites (T&#8722;Fe SAC) on spherical carbon surfaces were developed to investigate the change in surface microenvironments and catalysis behavior. Finite element method (FEM) simulations, together with experiments, indicate the strong local electric field of the tip&#8208;like FeN4 and the more denser interfacial water layer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate the pathway transition on the tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites, promoting the dissociation of O&#8722;O bond via side&#8208;on adsorption model. The adsorbed OH* can be facilely released on the curved surface and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. The obtained T&#8722;Fe SAC nanoreactor exhibits excellent ORR activities (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability, exceeding those of flat FeN4 and Pt/C. This work clarified the in&#8208;depth insights into the origin of catalytic activity of tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites and held great promise in industrial catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and many other fields.

Comprehensive experimental characterizations demonstrated that 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal integrated the properties of high mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a strong excimer emission (PLQY: 47.4&#8201;%). More importantly, color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting transistors were also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4&#8201;%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLETs for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Pyrene&#8208;Based 1,4&#8208;Dithiins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral pyrene&#8208;based 1,4&#8208;dithiins with cisoid or transoid connectivity between their cyclopenta[e]pyrene units on the dithiin core was introduced and their chiroptical properties were studied. The presence of one or two cyclopenta[e]pyrene units at the dithiin moiety was found to lead to different chiroptical parameters.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds are very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism, with respect to the g values, depending on their connectivity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water resistant S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction is in situ designed. The unique H2O&#8208;resistant AlOOH surface layer is conducive to steering the active species to form the dominant intermediates including benzoic acid and benzaldehyde instead of toxic phenols. These intermediates greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier thus resulting an excellent toluene removal efficiency and a high mineralization rate.







Abstract
Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.

         <title>Modifying the Oxidative Potentials of Imines in a Dye Loaded Capsule for Photocatalytic Cyclization with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the confinement effect of the host&#8208;dye photocatalytic system to shift the redox potentials of substrate, the isomerization and thermodynamic activation of substrate were achieved, which were followed by a multiphoton excitation enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Modifying redox potential of substrates and intermediates to balance pairs of redox steps are important stages for multistep photosynthesis but faced marked challenges. Through co&#8208;clathration of iridium photosensitizer and imine substrate within one packet of a metal&#8208;organic capsule to shift the redox potentials of substrate, herein, we reported a multiphoton enzymatic strategy for the generation of heterocycles by intramolecular C&#8722;X hydrogen evolution cross&#8208;couplings. The cage facilitated a pre&#8208;equilibrium substrate&#8208;involving clathrate that cathodic shifts the oxidation potential of the substrate&#8208;dye&#8208;host ternary complex and configuration inversion of substrate via spatial constraints in the confined space. The new two photon excitation strategy enabled the precise control of the multistep electron transfer between each pair (photosensitizer, substrate and the capsule), endowing the catalytic system proceeding smoothly with an enzymatic fashion. Three kinds of 2&#8208;subsituted (&#8722;OH, &#8722;NH2, and &#8722;SH) imines and N&#8208;aryl enamines all give the corresponding cyclization products efficiently under visible light irradiation, demonstrating the promising of the microenvironment driven thermodynamic activation in the host&#8208;dye&#8208;substrate ternary for synergistic combination of multistep photocatalytic transformations.

A series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A structured small molecule acceptors (SMAs) with benzotriazole core&#8208;based fused ring were synthesized by introducing different N&#8208;side chains on the benzotriazole core.

Abstract
Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.

All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue-shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain-based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long-lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BZ-E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ-core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of highly&#8208;substituted alkyl vinyl ethers in a well&#8208;defined configuration is challenging. Now, a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) enabled by dual&#8208;functional Cu catalysis is reported. It also represents a novel ring&#8208;opening pattern involving the cleavage of the C1&#8722;C3 bond in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.

         <title>Selective Photoelectrochemical Oxidation of Glycerol to Glyceric Acid on (002) Facets Exposed WO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(002) Facets exposed WO3 nanosheets display excellent performance in selective photoelectrochemical oxidization of glycerol to glyceric acid, reaching 73&#8201;% glyceric acid selectivity and 32.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 glyceric acid production at 0.9&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5G illumination.







Abstract
Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value&#8208;added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a 73&#8201;% GLYA selectivity and a 39&#8201;% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.

         <title>In situ Light&#8208;Writable Orientation Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Film Enabled by Chalcones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), where anisotropy can be written by linearly polarized light based on the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction of chalcone mesogens, is accomplished. Importantly, the sophisticated topography changes are realized by implanting regionally distributed anisotropy into LCE sheets.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with intrinsic anisotropy. However, it is still challenging to in situ program the mesogen alignment to realize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) deformations with high&#8208;resolution patterned structures. This work presents a feasible strategy to program the anisotropy of LCEs by using chalcone mesogens that can undergo a photoinduced cycloaddition reaction under linear polarized light. It is shown that by controlling the polarization director and the irradiation region, patterned alignment distribution in a freestanding LCE film can be created, which leads to complex and reversible 3D shape&#8208;morphing behaviors. The work demonstrates an in situ light&#8208;writing method to achieve sophisticated topography changes in LCEs, which has potential applications in encryption, sensors, and beyond.

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;Halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs3Bi2Br9 into one&#8208;dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O2&#8722; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.







Abstract
Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidated that the kinetical pathway can be maintained by regulating the structural connectivity of the in situ induced electrochemical Li reservoir, which ensures efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway. The well&#8208;distributed electrochemical Li reservoirs can serve as nucleation sites to promote uniform Li deposition and then improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries effectively.







Abstract
Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 Coupling of Carbon&#8208;Centered Benzyl Radicals with (Me4N)SCF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent was developed to afford enantioenriched trifluoromethylthiolated molecules. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands for the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
In contrast with the well&#8208;established C(sp2)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling to forge the Ar&#8722;SCF3 bond, the corresponding enantioselective coupling of readily available alkyl electrophiles to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 bond has remained largely unexplored. We herein disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 coupling of a range of secondary/tertiary benzyl radicals with the easily available (Me4N)SCF3 reagent. The key to the success lies in the utilization of chiral phosphino&#8208;oxazoline&#8208;derived anionic N,N,P&#8208;ligands through tuning electronic and steric effects for the simultaneous control of the reaction initiation and enantioselectivity. This strategy can successfully realize two types of asymmetric radical reactions, including enantioconvergent C(sp3)&#8722;SCF3 cross&#8208;coupling of racemic benzyl halides and three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;carbotrifluoromethylthiolation of arylated alkenes under mild reaction conditions. It therefore provides a highly flexible platform for the rapid assembly of an array of enantioenriched SCF3&#8208;containing molecules of interest in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Tuning Shortwave&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;aggregates of Aromatic Ring&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic ring [b]&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPYs are modified with multiple methoxyl groups to regulate the molecular surface electrostatic potential which successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregates. Importantly, BDP&#8208;a exhibits controllable J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation behaviors with adjustable morphologies. Its self&#8208;assembled J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles could be used for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapies under ultralow laser power density.







Abstract
Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo&#8208;damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptivity. J&#8208;aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable J&#8208;aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregation (&#955;absmax: 968&#8197;nm, &#1013;: 2.96&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#955;emmax: 972&#8197;nm, &#934;FL: 6.2&#8201;%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F&#8208;127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the J&#8208;aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave&#8208;infrared J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9&#8201;% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice&#8208;tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (915&#8197;nm). This phototherapeutic nano&#8208;platform, which generates predictable J&#8208;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form J&#8208;/H&#8208;aggregates and selectable J&#8208;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor&#8208;treatment at ultralow laser power density.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for upcycling PET waste into high&#8208;valued chemicals. The distinct phase structures of ZrO2, with different acid sites, play a crucial role in regulating product selectivity. Specifically, 5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2, with weak acid sites, shows high selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of MMB, while 5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2, featuring strong acid sites, predominantly produces overhydrogenated PX







Abstract
Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.

Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (5&#8201;%Cu/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (5&#8201;%Cu/t-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) predominantly produces p-xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compared to t-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This weak acidity of m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality transfer from light to matter was explored by proceeding with the plasmon&#8208;driven chemical reaction involving chirally distributed hot electrons with achiral Au nanoparticles and circularly polarized light. The chiral light&#8208;matter interactions were unraveled by circular differential scattering spectroscopy at the single particle level and theoretical simulations.







Abstract
Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and numerous applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension regarding how chirality transfer occurs between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy, which is correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. The results presented here uncover fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction and have implications for the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.

         <title>Unraveling the &#8220;Gap&#8208;Filling&#8221; Mechanism of Multiple Charge Carriers in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid featuring ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing, superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure demonstrates highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries, where NH4+ and H+ can serve as &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; ions to improve the utilization rate of active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
The utilization rate of active sites in cathode materials for Zn&#8208;based batteries is a key factor determining the reversible capacities. However, a long&#8208;neglected issue of the strong electrostatic repulsions among divalent Zn2+ in hosts inevitably causes the squander of some active sites (i.e., gap sites). Herein, we address this conundrum by unraveling the &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; mechanism of multiple charge carriers in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. The tailored MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid features an ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing (2.34&#8197;nm), superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure, demonstrating highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in the 1&#8197;M ZnSO4+0.5&#8197;M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The NH4+ and H+ ions can act as gap fillers to fully utilize the active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to accelerate the Zn2+ diffusion. Thus, unprecedentedly high rate capability (439.5 and 104.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (8000 cycles) are achieved.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with fused negative curvature and helicity have been facilely synthesized by twofold heptagonal cyclization. In addition to intriguing features arising from the dynamic chiral skeleton, the molecular packing of these curved helicenes can be modulated by the periphery groups and the extension of the skeleton. This leads to the formation of crystals with 31 helices and also homochiral nanosheets upon exfoliation.







Abstract
We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4&#8197;nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30&#8197;&#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core&#8208;Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.







Abstract
The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4SbF6&#8722;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene.

     alt="Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core-Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core-expanded [10]annulene analog was synthesized and oxidized to its cationic states. These compounds exhibit notable structural flexibility, allowing for topological twisting. The dication displays a simultaneous presence of singly twisted and planar isomers within the crystal structure, distinguished by M&#246;bius aromaticity and H&#252;ckel antiaromaticity, respectively. The tetracation shows H&#252;ckel aromaticity and open shell diradical nature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo-&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylmethine derivative (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and its tetracation (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polar perovskite MhyPbBr3 (Mhy=methylhydrazine), combining the merits of the excellent charge transition and bulk photovoltage effect, realized a sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The work first reports the unprecedented radiation photovoltage and efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D classic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, shedding light on future practical applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy=methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47&#8197;V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metallo&#8208;cages that combine multiple photosensitizer modules synergistically have been constructed through a simple method using pyrylium&#8208;pyridinium salts and coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Compared with the modules, cages with a porphyrin core exhibit a significant enhancement in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging cancer treatment, requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salt PSs together through condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced by the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with two porphyrin cores shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interactions with lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 has excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this study will enable the development of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.

         <title>Dipole Coupling Accelerated H2O Dissociation by Magnesium&#8208;Based Intermetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the d&#8208;band center is widely cited to predict the catalytic activity, the other factors, such as Coulomb interaction, have little been considered to design a catalyst for H2O&#8208;associated reactions. Using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we demonstrate the impact of dipole coupling on the H2O adsorption and dissociation processes.







Abstract
The water (H2O) dissociation is critical for various H2O&#8208;associated reactions, including water gas shift, hydrogen evolution reaction and hydrolysis corrosion. While the d&#8208;band center concept offers a catalyst design guideline for H2O activation, it cannot be applied to intermetallic or main group elements&#8208;based systems because Coulomb interaction was not considered. Herein, using hydrolysis corrosion of Mg as an example, we illustrate the critical role of the dipole of the intermetallic catalysts for H2O dissociation. The H2O dissociation kinetics can be enhanced using MgxMey (Me=Co, Ni, Cu, Si and Al) as catalysts, and the hydrogen generation rate of Mg2Ni&#8208;loaded Mg reached 80&#8197;times as high as Ni&#8208;loaded Mg. The adsorbed H2O molecules strongly couple with the Mg&#8722;Me dipole of MgxMey, lowering the H2O dissociation barrier. The dipole&#8208;based H2O dissociation mechanism is applicable to non&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based systems, such as Mg2Si and Mg17Al12, offering a flexible catalyst design strategy for controllable H2O dissociation.

         <title>Phase Behavior of Charged Star Block Copolymers at Fluids Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) with a polystyrene (PS) core and a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona was investigated at the water/toluene interface. The morphology of the s&#8208;BCPs was hexagonal&#8208;packed nanoporous film with s&#8208;BCP comprising the matrix. The morphology of linear BCPs were found to be inverted, where hexagonally packed rigid spherical micelles of BCP formed multilayer.







Abstract
The phase behavior of block copolymers (BCPs) at the water&#8208;oil interface is influenced by the segmental interaction parameter (
) and chain architecture. We synthesized a series of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) having polystyrene (PS) as core and poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona. The interaction parameters of block&#8208;block (
PS&#8208;P2VP) and block&#8208;solvent (
P2VP&#8208;solvent) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized&#8208;P2VP (Q&#8208;P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s&#8208;BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q&#8208;P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d&#8208;spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s&#8208;BCPs. Large&#8208;scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze&#8208;drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal&#8208;packed rigid spherical micelles with Q&#8208;P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film with well&#8208;controlled pore structure.

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of meltable aluminum molecular rings with precise lattice doping of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) shows that the abundant, complex and strong hydrogen bonds between the clusters and the DESs components is responsible for the melting behavior. The hot&#8208;press method is used to prepare transparent bubble&#8208;free cluster&#8208;based glass films under autogenous pressure and study their fluorescence and nonlinear optical properties.







Abstract
Crystal&#8211;liquid&#8211;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.

         <title>H* Species Regulation by Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 for Efficient Nitrate Electro&#8208;reduction in Neutral Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn doped Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst was designed to promote the NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 by accelerating the H* generation from water dissociation and inhibiting the H* binding between each other for hydrogen evolution, which ensures the much enhanced FE (98.9%) and stability (500&#8197;h) for ammonia production.







Abstract
During the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) under neutral condition, the activation of H2O to generate H* and the inhibition of inter&#8208;H* species binding, are critically important but remain challenging for suppressing the non&#8208;desirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Mn&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 (named as Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2) has been synthesized by in situ reconstruction in the electrolyte, which is able to dissociate H2O molecules but inhibits the binding of H* species between each other owing to the increased interatomic spacing by the Mn&#8208;doping. The Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst offers a faradaic efficiency (FE) of as high as 98.9&#177;1.7% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an energy efficiency (EE) of 49.90&#177;1.03% for NH3 production by NO3&#8722;RR, which are among the highest of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, negligible degradation at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been found for at least 500&#8197;h, which is the longest catalytic durations ever reported. This work paves a novel approach for the design and synthesis of efficient NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>

The selective creation of Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structures using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208; hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) highlights its enhanced affinity for cytosine compared to the previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] (Cheld=chelidamic acid). The resulting assembly mimics a natural DNA double helix, with the [Pd(Aqa)(Cytosine)] units acting as metal&#8208;mediated base pairs and offers the potential for heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids.







Abstract
The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using the [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa=8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C=cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld=chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES) is developed to realize the direct synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), allowing structural transformation to be uncovered during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using in situ characterizations. The reconstructed MOF shows an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons, leading to outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential and good stability.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M=Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8722;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and good stability (144&#8197;h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.

         <title>Chemically Transformed Ag2Te Nanowires on Polyvinylidene Fluoride Membrane For Flexible Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible thermoelectric generator is prepared from chemically transformed Ag2Te nanowires, which are prepared from tellurium nanowires, for low power wearable and flexible electronic devices.







Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge. We are reporting a flexible thermoelectric module prepared from silver telluride (Ag2Te) nanowires (NWs), which are chemically transformed from uniquely synthesized and scalable tellurium (Te) NWs. Conducting Ag2Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~0.22&#8197;W/mK surpassing the bulk melt&#8208;grown Ag2Te ~1.23&#8197;W/mK at ~300&#8197;K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n&#8208;type) of Ag2Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (Voc) ~2.3&#8197;mV upon human touch and Voc ~18&#8197;mV at temperature gradient, &#916;T ~50&#8197;K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.

         <dc:description>
A new method to obtain hydrogel with a topologically cross&#8208;linked structure has been developed by Yuichi Ohya et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202317045). Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. A water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure was synthesized. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, and the extending polymer chains&#160;penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.

Developing effective catalysts for chemical recycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene with commercial grade stands out due to its inertness. In their Research Article (e202317526), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that 1&#8208;nm ruthenium particles supported on titania catalyze the hydrogenolysis to C1&#8211;C45 alkanes of plastic caps used in soft drinks. They quantify the contribution of mechanistic routes and identify deactivation pathways introduced by common additives.

Dipole coupling between catalysts and H2O molecules is utilized to control H2O adsorption and dissociation processes. In their Research Article (e202400119), Yangfan Lu, Qian Li, Fusheng Pan et&#8197;al. showed that the catalyst's dipole moment can be adjusted by modifying the electronegativity gap of utilized elements and realized a systematic control of H2O activation processes. These discoveries offer a catalyst design guideline for the H2O&#8208;associated reactions in addition to the widely cited d&#8208;band center concept.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Optimize the Properties of Organic Fluorophores for Imaging and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review has clarified the reasons for the insufficient properties of fluorophores, including short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, and summarizes the methods for optimizing these properties developed in recent years. The review will provide a theoretical guidance and helpful insights for the design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields. However, many available dyes suffer from insufficient performances, such as short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, restricting their application in advanced imaging technology and complex imaging. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been made to improve these performances of fluorophores. Starting with the luminescence principle of fluorophores, this review clarifies the mechanisms of the insufficient performance for traditional fluorophores to a certain extent, systematically summarizes the modified approaches of optimizing properties, highlights the typical applications of the improved fluorophores in imaging and sensing, and indicates existing problems and challenges in this area. This progress not only proves the significance of improving fluorophores properties, but also provide a theoretical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.

         <title>Multiphasic Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactors for Handling Gaseous Reagents in Organic Synthesis: Enhancing Efficiency and Safety in Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using highly reactive gases is appealing for efficient organic synthesis but leads to inherent safety and processing limitations. Embracing continuous&#8208;flow technologies helps mitigating those while improving the performance of the systems. Tailored catalyst incorporation opens doors to novel reaction pathways and process intensification. Optimized mass transfer in multiphasic mixtures is key to its success, especially when solids are present.







Abstract
The use of reactive gaseous reagents for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge due to safety and efficiency limitations. The implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors has resulted in rapid development of gas&#8208;handling technology because of several advantages such as increased interfacial area, improved mass&#8208; and heat transfer, and seamless scale&#8208;up. This technology enables shorter and more atom&#8208;economic synthesis routes for the production of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of literature from 2016 onwards in the development of gas&#8208;handling continuous&#8208;flow technology as well as the use of gases in functionalization of APIs.

         <title>Catalytic Protein Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic inhibitors (CIs) mediate some type of post&#8208;translational modification that inactivates the target protein. This can provide a substantial increase in potency relative to occupancy&#8208;driven inhibitors. This article reviews the development of this field, current applications in targeted protein degradation, and design considerations for non&#8208;degradative CIs.







Abstract
Many of the highest priority targets in a wide range of disease states are difficult&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. The development of reversible small molecule inhibitors for the active sites of these proteins with sufficient affinity and residence time on&#8208;target is an enormous challenge. This has engendered interest in strategies to increase the potency of a given protein inhibitor by routes other than further improvement in gross affinity. Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein.

     alt="Catalytic Protein Inhibitors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic inhibitors (CIs) mediate some type of post-translational modification that inactivates the target protein. This can provide a substantial increase in potency relative to occupancy-driven inhibitors. This article reviews the development of this field, current applications in targeted protein degradation, and design considerations for non-degradative CIs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the highest priority targets in a wide range of disease states are difficult-to-drug proteins. The development of reversible small molecule inhibitors for the active sites of these proteins with sufficient affinity and residence time on-target is an enormous challenge. This has engendered interest in strategies to increase the potency of a given protein inhibitor by routes other than further improvement in gross affinity. Amongst these, the development of catalytic protein inhibitors has garnered the most attention and investment, particularly with respect to protein degraders, which catalyze the destruction of the target protein. This article discusses the genesis of the burgeoning field of catalytic inhibitors, the current state of the art, and exciting future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pentazolate Anion: A Rare and Preferred Five&#8208;Membered Ligand for Constructing Pentasil&#8208;Zeolite Topology Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The penta&#8208;coordinated pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) can be viewed as an enlarged pentagon. Three zeolitic or zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks (MPFs) were assembled under different auxiliary ligands and solvent environments. They both feature pentagonal building units composed of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anions, implying the unique potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; for constructing pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies.







Abstract
As the fourth full&#8208;nitrogen structure, the pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) was highly coveted for decades. In 2017, the first air&#8208;stable non&#8208;metal pentazolate salt, (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl, was obtained, representing a milestone in this field. As the latest member of the azole family, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; is comprised of five nitrogen atoms. Although significant attention has been paid to the potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; as an energetic material, its poor thermostability hinders any practical application. However, the unique ring structure and multiple coordination capability of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; provide a platform for the fabrication of various structures, among which pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are the most intriguing. In addition, the introduction of structure&#8208;directing auxiliaries enables the self&#8208;assembly of diverse topological architectures, potentially imparting cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; with the potential to impact wide&#8208;ranging areas of coordination chemistry and topology. In this minireview, different pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies based on metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks are evaluated. To date, three zeolitic and zeolite&#8208;like topologies have been reported, namely the melanophlogite (MEP), chibaite (MTN), and unj topologies. The MEP topology consists of two nanocages, Na20N60 and Na24N60, whereas the MTN topology contains Na20N60 and Na28N80 nanocages. Furthermore, the unj topology features multiple homochiral channels consisting of two helical chains. Various possible strategies for obtaining additional pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are also discussed.

Two dimensional (2D) metastable&#8208;phase oxides, which combine the distinctive characteristics of metal oxides, 2D materials, and metastable&#8208;phase materials, have attracted significant attention. This Minireview predicts the occurrence and highlights the advantages, reliable syntheses, and catalytic applications of 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides.







Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, the development of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials has received considerable interest. Recently, as a newly emerging member of the 2D family, 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides that combine the unique advantages of metal oxides, 2D structures, and metastable&#8208;phase materials have shown enormous potential in various catalytic reactions. In this review, the potential of various 2D materials to form a metastable&#8208;phase is predicted. The advantages of 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides for advanced applications, reliable methods of synthesizing 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides, and the application of these oxides in different catalytic reactions are presented. Finally, the challenges associated with 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides and future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 Oligomerization in Cell Membrane Revealed by Photo&#8208;Activated Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from super&#8208;resolution microscopy: Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2), a widely used optogenetic tool, forms dimers, not higher oligomers, in human cell membranes. Disruption of inter&#8208;protein disulfide bonds leads to partial ChR2 monomerization, particularly in cells with lower ChR2 densities. This study enhances the understanding of ChR2 oligomerization and assists optogenetic tool design.







Abstract
Microbial rhodopsins are retinal membrane proteins that found a broad application in optogenetics. The oligomeric state of rhodopsins is important for their functionality and stability. Of particular interest is the oligomeric state in the cellular native membrane environment. Fluorescence microscopy provides powerful tools to determine the oligomeric state of membrane proteins directly in cells. Among these methods is quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (qPALM) allowing the investigation of molecular organization at the level of single protein clusters. Here, we apply qPALM to investigate the oligomeric state of the first and most used optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. ChR2 appeared predominantly as a dimer in the cell membrane and did not form higher oligomers. The disulfide bonds between Cys34 and Cys36 of adjacent ChR2 monomers were not required for dimer formation and mutations disrupting these bonds resulted in only partial monomerization of ChR2. The monomeric fraction increased when the total concentration of mutant ChR2 in the membrane was low. The dissociation constant was estimated for this partially monomerized mutant ChR2 as 2.2&#177;0.9 proteins/&#956;m2. Our findings are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of ChR2 activity as well as for improving existing and developing future optogenetic tools.

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto longest nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres with antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles embedded in the backbones have been synthesized. The position of the antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 rings remarkably affects the molecular orbital arrangement of the BN&#8208;nonacenes. BN&#8208;3 displays a favorable radiative transition and thus a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating a pair of antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN-isosteres via incorporating a pair of antiaromatic B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN-heteroacenes. The distance between the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rings affects the contribution of the charge-separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of &lt;b&gt;BN-3&lt;/b&gt; is greatly enhanced compared with &lt;b&gt;BN-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BN-2&lt;/b&gt;, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN-isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Topological Gels by Penetrating Polymerization Using a Molecular Net</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints. We synthesized a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure. When a water&#8208;soluble monomer was polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrated the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components.







Abstract
Topological gels possess structures that are cross&#8208;linked only via physical constraints; ideally, no attractive intermolecular interactions act between their components, which yields interesting physical properties. However, most reported previous topological gels were synthesized based on supramolecular interlocked structures such as polyrotaxane, for which attractive intermolecular interactions are essential. Here, we synthesize a water&#8208;soluble &#8220;molecular net&#8221; (MN) with a large molecular weight and three&#8208;dimensional network structure using poly(ethylene glycol). When a water&#8208;soluble monomer (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) is polymerized in the presence of the MNs, the extending polymer chains penetrates the MNs to form an ideal topological MN gel with no specific attractive interactions between its components. The MN gels show unique physical properties as well a significantly high degree of swelling and high extensibility due to slipping of the physical cross&#8208;linking. We postulate this method to yield a new paradigm in gel science with unprecedented physical properties.

         <title>An Organocopper(III) Fluoride Triggering C&#8722;CF3 Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocopper(III) fluoride, [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), has been isolated and authenticated. Despite its stability, 2 reacts with alkynylsilanes leading to industrially relevant trifluoromethylalkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3). Mechanistic investigations, including the trapping of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)] (4a), validates the operability of a CuI/CuIII redox shuttle in oxidative C&#8722;C couplings occurring through hitherto elusive organocopper(III) fluorides.







Abstract
Copper(III) fluorides are catalytically competent, yet elusive, intermediates in cross&#8208;coupling. The synthesis of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), the first stable (isolable) CuIII&#8722;F, was accomplished via chloride addition to [CuIII(CF3)3(py)] (1) yielding [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3Cl(py)] (1&#8901;Cl), followed by treatment with AgF. The CuIII halides 1&#8901;Cl and 2 were fully characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (Sc&#8208;XRD) and elemental analysis (EA). Complex 2 proved capable of forging C&#8722;CF3 bonds from silyl&#8208;capped alkynes. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies combining probes, theoretical calculations, trapping of intermediate 4a ([PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)]) and radical tests unveil the key role of the CuIII acetylides that undergo facile 2e&#8722; reductive elimination furnishing the trifluoromethylated alkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3), which are industrially relevant synthons in drug discovery, pharma and agrochemistry.

         <title>Polar X&#8722;H Bond (X=O, S, N) Activation at a Cage Silanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon anions (silanides) supported by a tridentate nitrogen ligand are shown to undergo oxidative addition of X&#8722;H bonds (X=O, S, N) under mild conditions to form pentacoordinate hydrosilicates.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent silicon compounds such as neutral silylenes display versatile reactivity for the activation of small molecules. In contrast, their anionic congeners silanides ([R3Si&#8722;]) have primarily been investigated for their nucleophilic reactivity. Here we show that incorporating a silanide center in a bicyclic cage structure allows for formal oxidative addition of polar element&#8208;hydrogen bonds (RX&#8722;H, R=aromatic residue, X=O, S, NH). The resulting hydrosilicates were isolated and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations support an ionic mechanism for RX&#8722;H bond activation. Finally, the reactivity of the RS&#8722;H bond adduct was further investigated, revealing that it behaves as a Lewis pair upon facile heterolytic cleavage of the Si&#8722;S bond.

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized through the two&#8208;step sequential oxidation of readily available imine&#8208;linked COFs, eliminating the requirement for a predesigned OH. This innovative method has high conversion efficiency, crystallinity preservation, and broad applicability, marking a significant advancement in expanding the library of benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8722;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8722;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8722;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8722;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8722;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8722;COFs into BO&#8722;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8722;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 11, March 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic polyoxovanadate cage, V30Nb12, has been successfully synthesized by introducing Nb to polyoxovanadates and the V30Nb12 cage is assembled by 12 {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, similar to fullerene C60.







Abstract
The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV/Vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8722;V30Nb12).

         <title>Discovery of selective and potent ATR degrader for exploration its kinase&#8208;independent functions in acute myeloid leukemia cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATR has emerged as a promising target for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Several potent ATR inhibitors are currently undergoing various stages of clinical trials, but none have yet received FDA approval due to unclear regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we discovered a potent and selective ATR degrader. Its kinase&#8208;independent regulatory functions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were elucidated using this proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule as a probe. The ATR degrader, 8i, exhibited significantly different cellular phenotypes compared to the ATR kinase inhibitor 1. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATR deletion led to breakdown in the nuclear envelope, causing genome instability and extensive DNA damage. This would increase the expression of p53 and triggered immediately p53&#8208;mediated apoptosis signaling pathway, which was earlier and more effective than ATR kinase inhibition. Based on these findings, the in vivo anti&#8208;proliferative effects of ATR degrader 8i were assessed using xenograft models. The degrader significantly inhibited the growth of AML cells in vivo, unlike the ATR inhibitor. These results suggest that the marked anti&#8208;AML activity is regulated by the kinase&#8208;independent functions of the ATR protein. Consequently, developing potent and selective ATR degraders could be a promising strategy for treating AML.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated Gold Nanoflares for High&#8208;Fidelity Phototheranostics: Reducing Side&#8208;Effects and Enhancing Cytotoxicity toward Target Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized with the Au&#8208;S bond, gold nanoflares have emerged as promising candidates for theranostics. However, the presence of intracellular abundantly biothiols compromises the conventional Au&#8208;S bond, leading to unintended release of cargoes and associated side&#8208;effects on non&#8208;target cells. Additionally, hypoxic microenvironment in diseased regions limits treatment efficacy, particularly in dynamic therapy. To address these challenges, high&#8208;fidelity photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals and side&#8208;effects caused by biothiol perturbation. Compared with conventional photodynamic gold nanoflares (AuNP PDNF), the Au@Pt PDNF was selectively activated by cancer biomarker and exhibited high&#8208;fidelity phototheranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the ultrathin Pt&#8208;shell catalysis was confirmed to generate oxygen that relieved hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced antitumor effect. This design might open a new venue to advance the theranostics performance and is adaptable to other theranostic nanomaterials by simply adding a Pt shell.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Superionic Conductors with Non&#8208;Close&#8208;Packed Anion Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide superionic conductors (SICs) are drawing significant research attention for their potential applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge in developing such SICs involves exploring and designing halide structural frameworks that enable rapid ion movement. In this work, we show that the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks shared by traditional halide ionic conductors face intrinsic limitations in fast ion conduction, regardless of structural regulation. Beyond the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks, we identify that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks have great potential to achieve superionic conductivity. Notably, we unravel that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed UCl3&#8208;type framework exhibits superionic conductivity for a diverse range of carrier ions, including Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+, which are validated through both ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. We elucidate that the remarkable ionic conductivity observed in the UCl3&#8208;type framework structure stems from its significantly more distorted sites and larger diffusion channels than its close&#8208;packed counterparts. By employing the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion framework as the key feature in high&#8208;throughput computational screening, we also identify the LiGaCl3 as a promising candidate for halide SICs. These discoveries provide crucial insights for the exploration and design of novel halide SICs.</dc:description>

These discoveries provide crucial insights for the exploration and design of novel halide SICs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective C4 Separation by Zeolite Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic zeolites have excellent molecular sieving properties, but they are difficult to process into macroscopic structures. In this work, we use metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass as substrates to engineer the interface with inorganic zeolites, and then assemble the discrete crystalline zeolite powders into monolithic structures. The zeolites are well dispersed and stabilized within the MOF glass matrix, and the monolith has satisfactory mechanical stabilities for membrane applications. We demonstrate the effective separation performance of the membrane for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) from other C4 hydrocarbons, which is a crucial and challenging separation in the chemical industry. The membrane achieves a high permeance of C4H6 (693.00 &#177; 21.83 GPU) and a high selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, isobutene, and isobutane (9.72, 9.94, 10.31, and 11.24, respectively). This strategy opens up new possibilities for developing advanced membrane materials for difficult hydrocarbon separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride and hydride transfer as keys to catalytic upcycling of polyethylene into liquid alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transforming polyolefin waste into liquid alkanes through tandem cracking&#8208;alkylation reactions catalyzed by Lewis&#8208;acid chlorides offers an efficient route for single&#8208;step plastic upcycling. Lewis acids in dichloromethane establish a polar environment that stabilizes carbenium ion intermediates and catalyzes hydride transfer, enabling breaking of polyethylene C&#8722;C bonds and forming C&#8722;C bonds in alkylation. Here, we show that efficient and selective deconstruction of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) to liquid alkanes is achieved with anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and gallium chloride (GaCl3). Already at 60 &#176;C, complete LDPE conversion was achieved, while maintaining the selectivity for gasoline&#8208;range liquid alkanes over 70%. AlCl3 showed an exceptional conversion rate of 5000 gLDPEmolcat&#8208;1h&#8208;1, surpassing other Lewis acid catalysts by two orders of magnitude.&#160;Through kinetic and mechanistic studies, we show that the rates of LDPE conversion do not correlate directly with the intrinsic strength of the Lewis acids or steric constraints that may limit the polymer to access the Lewis acid sites. Instead, the rates for the tandem processes of cracking and alkylation are primarily governed by the rates of initiation of carbenium ions and the subsequent intermolecular hydride transfer. Both jointly control the relative rates of cracking and alkylation, thereby determining the overall conversion and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ynamide and Azaalleneyl. Acid&#8208;Base Promoted Chelotropic and Spin&#8208;State Rearrangements in a Versatile Heterocumulene [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8211;.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce the heterocumulene ligand [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722; (Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl (C10H15), tBu = tert&#8208;butyl, (C4H9)), which can adopt two forms, the azaalleneyl and ynamide. This ligand platform can undergo a reversible chelotropic shift using Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry, which promotes an unprecedented spin&#8208;state change of the [VIII] ion. These unique scaffolds are prepared via addition of 1&#8208;adamantyl isonitrile (C&#8801;NAd) across the alkylidyne in complexes [(BDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf)] (A) (BDI&#8722; = ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH3)NAr), Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) and [(dBDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2)] (B) (dBDI2&#8722; = ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH2)NAr). Complex A reacts with C&#8801;NAd, to generate the high&#8208;spin [VIII] complex with a k1&#8208;N&#8208;ynamide ligand, [(BDI)V{k1&#8208;N&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}(OTf)] (1). Conversely, B reacts with C&#8801;NAd to generate a low&#8208;spin [VIII] diamagnetic complex having a chelated k2&#8208;C,N&#8208;azaalleneyl ligand, [(dBDI)V{k2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}] (2). Theoretical studies have been applied to better understand the mechanism of formation of 2 and the electronic reconfiguration upon structural rearrangement by the alteration of ligand denticity between 1 and 2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Versatile Establishment of Charge Storage in Polymer Solid Electrolyte with Enhanced Charge Transfer for LiF&#8208;Rich SEI Generation in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a porous organic polymer with "charge storage" properties was prepared and doped into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to study the effect of sufficient charge transfer on the decomposition of lithium salts. The results show in contrast to porphyrins, the unique structure of POF allows for charge transfer between each individual porphyrin. Therefore, during TFSI&#8208; decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI&#8208; can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C&#8208;F and forming the LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423 e&#8208;), POF provides 2.7 times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147 e&#8208;). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO&#8208;POF can be operated stably for more than 2700 h at 60 &#176;C. Even the Li//Li (45 &#956;m) symmetric cells are stable for more than 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;1. In addition, LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li batteries have excellent cycling performance at 2 C (80% capacity retention after 750 cycles). Even LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li (45 &#956;m) cells have excellent cycling performance at 1 C (96% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Even when the PEO&#8208;base is replaced with a PEG&#8208;base and a PVDF&#8208;base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved</dc:description>

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Single&#8208;Copper&#8208;Site Catalysts for Room&#8208;Temperature Benzene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crafting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that possess &#8220;just right&#8221; modulated electronic and geometric structures, granting accessible active sites for direct room&#8208;temperature benzene oxidation is a coveted objective. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge. Here, we introduce an innovative in&#8208;situ phosphorus&#8208;immitting strategy using a new phosphorus source (phosphorus nitride, P3N5) to construct the phosphorus&#8208;rich copper (Cu) SACs, designated as Cu/NPC. These catalysts feature locally protruding metal sites on a nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support (NPC). Rigorous analyses, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), validate the coordinated bonding of nitrogen and phosphorus with atomically dispersed Cu sites on NPC. Crucially, systematic first&#8208;principles calculations, coupled with the climbing image nudged&#8208;elastic&#8208;band (CI&#8208;NEB) method, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of the distorted Cu&#8208;N2P2 centers in Cu/NPC for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol production. Interestingly, Cu/NPC has shown more energetically favorable C&#8208;H bond activation compared to the benchmark Cu/NC SACs in the direct oxidation of benzene, resulting in outstanding benzene conversion (50.3%) and phenol selectivity (99.3%) at room temperature. Furthermore, Cu/NPC achieves a remarkable turnover frequency of 263 h&#8722;1 and mass&#8208;specific activity of 35.2 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol conversion catalysts to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#160;rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2 &#181;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6 mS and 81.6 mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1 V),&#160;are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1 kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000 seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Organogold(III) Complexes Enable High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X&#8208;ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, through adopting a through&#8208;space interaction motif to realize high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through&#8208;bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity&#8208;dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record&#8208;high scintillation light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&#8208;1 for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with &gt;16.0 line pairs mm&#8211;1 spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkoxycarbonyl Groups in Metalloesters Showing Oxocarbenium&#8208;like Structure and Alkylating Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;documented acylating reactivity, the alkylating reactivity of the alkoxycarbonyl group, as signified by its oxocarbenium&#8208;like resonance structure, remains almost&#160;unexplored. Herein, the first series of Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters exhibiting the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups were synthesized and characterized. In these deformed alkoxycarbonyl groups, the Ccarbonyl&#8211;Oalkoxyl bonds were contracted to 1.177(11) ~ 1.191(9) &#197; with the elongations of the Ccarbonyl=Ocarbonyl bonds to 1.368(13) ~ 1.441(9) &#197;. Meanwhile, the O&#8211;Calkyl bonds were also elongated to 1.522(11) ~ 1.607(15) &#197;, and were by far the longest O&#8211;Calkyl bonds reported for alkoxycarbonyl groups. As triggered by the long O&#8208;Calkyl distances, the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like methoxycarbonyl group towards a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism at ambient conditions was examined. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;etherifications of alcohols mediated by the Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters were investigated. The yields followed the trend ethanol &gt;&gt; n&#8208;propanol &gt;&gt; n&#8208;butanol &#8776; n&#8208;pentanol, that closely related to the structure features of the alkoxycarbonyl groups in corresponding metalloesters: while the ethoxycarbonyl group showed the reactive oxocarbenium&#8208;like framework, the n&#8208;propoxycarbonyl group displayed the dioxocarbenium&#8208;like skeleton with a shorter O&#8211;Calkyl bond; In comparison, the classical frameworks with unactivated alkyl moieties were observed for n&#8208;butoxycarbonyl and n&#8208;pentoxycarbonyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Cu Plates with Steady Fluid Fields for High&#8208;rate Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia and Efficient Zn&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas in a microfluid flow cell to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis, and could be extended to assemble efficient Zn&#8208;nitrate batteries.







Abstract
Nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising strategy for nitrogen utilization, while achieving high selectivity and durability at an industrial scale has remained challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99&#8201;%, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis for 120&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high yield rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the proposed strategy was successfully extended to the Zn&#8208;nitrate battery system, providing a power density of 12.09&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 FE of 85.4&#8201;%, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eNO3&#8722;RR catalysts. Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.

         <title>Descriptor&#8208;Based Volcano Relations Predict Single Atoms for Hydroxylamine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior hydroxylamine (NH2OH) selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proven to enhance NH2OH formation.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (Gad(*NHO)) as a performance descriptor. A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior NH2OH selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict a series of SACs and discover Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. These theoretical prediction results are also confirmed by experimental results, rationalizing our Gad(*NHO) descriptor. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proved to enhance NH2OH formation.

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalyst is presented and ATR&#8208;FTIR is used to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722;, a key intermediate in acidic electrolyte on its surface. It is shown that the increase of electrolyte pH results in a redshift of the peak position of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate, i.e., the adsorption strength of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate increases, which in turn affects the performance of CO2RR to direct HCOOH in acidic electrolyte.







Abstract
The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediatethat enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH=3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8&#8201;%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8722;178.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediate is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpolar pore environments with N/O active sites in a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) are generated for ethylene purification and propylene recovery. The material exhibits the good balance between excellent separation performance, facile scale synthesis, economic feasibility and high stability for applications.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3&#8197;hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.

         <title>In situ and Real&#8208;time Monitoring the Chemical and Thermal Evolution of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A buried flexible optical fiber in the pouch&#8208;type lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enable in situ and real&#8208;time temperature monitoring during charge/discharge process. Batteries with single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) cathode show a much lower temperature rise and alleviated phase transition at elevated temperature compared to polycrystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;PC) cathode, highlighting NCM&#8208;SC&#8242;s enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch&#8208;type LIBs with NCM&#8208;SC cathode to in situ study its real&#8208;time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an enhanced Li+ ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch&#8208;type battery. Meanwhile, solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM&#8208;SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock&#8208;salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of S&#8722;Si Reagents by Silylium Ions for Their Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Addition Across C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ&#8208;generated bissilylated sulfonium ion is the actual catalyst in highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective addition reactions of thiosilanes across the C&#8722;C multiple bonds of alkynes and allenes, respectively (see scheme). These thiosilylation reactions enable the direct installation of two orthogonal linchpins for further chemoselective functional&#8208;group manipulation.







Abstract
A regioselective silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;promoted thiosilylation of internal C&#8722;C triple bonds with control over the double bond geometry is described. Both a C(sp2)&#8722;S and a C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond are formed with a trans relationship in this two&#8208;component reaction of an alkyne and a thiosilane. The resulting orthogonally functionalized C&#8722;C double bond can be chemoselectively defunctionalized or further processed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions with the alkene configuration retained. The procedure is also applicable to the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiosilylation of terminal allenes to arrive at allylic thioethers containing a vinylsilane unit. These reactions involve the electrophilic activation of the S&#8722;Si reagent, both a silylated thiophenol and even alkylthiol derivative, by an in situ&#8208;generated carbocation intermediate. The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl&#8208; or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction are also reported.

The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl- or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X-ray diffraction are also reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#8216;aniono&#8217; helicates have been formed by the coordination of tetraphenylethene&#8208;decorated anion&#8208;binding ligand with phosphate ions. The triple helicates can be solution&#8208;processed with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix to generate functional thin films with multiple optical properties and used to recognize choline and its derivatives in water.







Abstract
Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in research areas such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have determined that an anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film by incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by the incorporation of the anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate show multiple optical properties, such as fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, the film has the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in a water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by the film represents the first example of utilizing &#8216;aniono&#8217;&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, graphite armor serves as a natural molecule sieve screening out bulky adversative molecules like O2 or CO but allowing H2 to diffuse along both the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane direction. This creates perfect chance for fabricating robust HOR electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342&#8197;nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.

         <title>Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how molecular vibrations influence the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of double helicenes DPC and DNH. It highlights how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, emphasizing the role of Herzberg&#8208;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.







Abstract
The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of S&#8208; and X&#8208;shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in&#8208;depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely DPC and DNH. Employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations utilizing the FC&#8208;HT1|VH model at the CAM&#8722;B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8211;Condon (FC), Herzberg&#8208;Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S1&#8208;to&#8208;S0 electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength&#8208;dependent dissymmetry (g) factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely&#8208;tunable CPL responses.

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Strained meso&#8208;meso&#8208;Linked Porphyrin Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding to a template bends a photonic wire consisting of 18 meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrins into a ring, allowing covalent cyclization by Glaser coupling, to yield a strained nanoring. The 18&#8208;legged template was synthesized efficiently via six&#8208;fold iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation. The nanoring was characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).







Abstract
Strained macrocycles display interesting properties, such as conformational rigidity, often resulting in enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation or enhanced affinity for non&#8208;covalent guest binding, yet they can be difficult to synthesize. Here we use computational modeling to design a template to direct the formation of an 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring with direct meso&#8208;meso bonds between the porphyrin units. Coupling of a linear 18&#8208;porphyrin oligomer in the presence of this template gives the target nanoring, together with an unexpected 36&#8208;porphyrin ring by&#8208;product. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the elliptical conformations and flexibility of these nanorings on a Au(111) surface.

         <title>Electrostatic Field in Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Driven C&#8208;F Bond Cleavage of Perfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and toxic to human health. It is demanding for high&#8208;efficient and green technologies to remove PFASs from water. In this study, a novel PFAS treatment technology was developed, utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (1~5 &#956;m) as the catalyst and a low frequency ultrasound (US, 40 kHz, 0.3 W/cm2) for activation. Remarkably, this system can induce near&#8208;complete defluorination for different structured PFASs. The underlying mechanism relies on contact electrification between PTFE and water, which induces cumulative electrons on PTFE surface, and creates a high surface voltage (tens of volts). Such high surface voltage can generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., O2&#8226;&#8211;, HO&#8226;, etc.) and a strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF of 109~1010 V/m). Consequently, the strong IEF significantly activates PFAS molecules and reduces the energy barrier of O2&#8226;&#8211; nucleophilic reaction. Simultaneously, the co&#8208;existence of surface electrons (PTFE*(e&#8722;)) and HO&#8226; enables synergetic reduction and oxidation of PFAS and its intermediates, leading to enhanced and thorough defluorination. The US/PTFE method shows compelling advantages of low energy consumption, zero chemical input, and few harmful intermediates. It offers a new and promising solution for effectively treating the PFAS&#8208;contaminated drinking water.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the property and amorphous structural was studied. Distorted metal nodes in amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks affect the electronic structure with downshifted conduction band (CB) potential, which facilitates the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process and O2 activation. Amorphous material displays a better photocatalytic activity of toluene oxidation than crystalline one (2.45&#8197;times).







Abstract
Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Oriented Quasi&#8208;Spherical CsPbBr3 Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven approach is employed to achieve the controlled synthesis of four types of CsPbBr3 crystals and successfully control the orientation of quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 structures. Synthesis parameters are optimized using high&#8208;throughput characterization combined with machine learning. Furthermore, the synthetic mechanism is determined. Oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, screened by using the data&#8208;driven approach, exhibit significantly improved optical properties.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of lead&#8208;halide perovskite crystals is challenging yet attractive because of the pivotal role played by the crystal structure and growth conditions in regulating their properties. This study introduces data&#8208;driven strategies for the controlled synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, alongside an investigation into the synthesis mechanism. High&#8208;throughput rapid characterization of absorption spectra and color under ultraviolet illumination was conducted using 23 possible ligands for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 crystals. The links between the absorption spectra slope (difference in the absorbance at 400&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm divided by a wavelength interval of 50&#8197;nm) and crystal size were determined through statistical analysis of more than 100 related publications. Big data analysis and machine learning were employed to investigate a total of 688 absorption spectra and 652 color values, revealing correlations between synthesis parameters and properties. Ex situ characterization confirmed successful synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 perovskites using polyvinylpyrrolidone and Acacia. Density functional theory calculations highlighted strong adsorption of Acacia on the (110) facet of CsPbBr3. Optical properties of the oriented quasi&#8208;spherical perovskites prepared with these data&#8208;driven strategies were significantly improved. This study demonstrates that data&#8208;driven controlled synthesis facilitates morphology&#8208;controlled perovskites with excellent optical properties.

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles, and Fe&#8722;CeO2 nanoparticles in an active multicomponent ensemble has been unraveled with the capacity to simultaneously enhance ORR activity (a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.948&#8197;V vs. RHE) and durability (negligible loss after 50k&#8197;cycles) in alkaline. Density functional theory and machine learning reveal the necessary electronic interactions (&#1013;d, Wf, &#956;B, Q) and geometric interactions (d and dFe&#8722;N) in a collective effect.







Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851&#8197;VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) were synthesized as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS production even than the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.

         <title>Aza[5]helicene&#8208;Derived Semiconducting Polymers for Improved Performance in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exploring Energetic and Morphological Influences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating copolymer of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, and phenoxazine, featured by matched energy levels, excellent film&#8208;forming properties, enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, was demonstrated for perovskite solar cells, which attain average initial efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, excellent 85&#8201;&#176;C thermal stability, and operational stability under the full sunlight.







Abstract
The strategic design of solution&#8208;processable semiconducting polymers possessing both matched energy levels and elevated glass transition temperatures is of urgent importance in the progression of thermally robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 25&#8201;%. In this work, we employed direct arylation polymerization to achieve the high&#8208;yield synthesis of three aza[5]helicene&#8208;derived copolymers with distinct HOMO energy levels and exceptional glass transition temperatures. Upon integration of these semiconducting polymers into formamidinium lead triiodide&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, marked disparities in photovoltaic parameters manifest, primarily stemming from variations in the electrical conductivity and film morphology of the hole transport layers. The p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E copolymer, featuring a main chain comprising alternating repeats of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, phenoxazine, and ethylenedioxythiophene, attains an initial average efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, markedly surpassing reference materials such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (23.0&#8201;%), PTAA (17.0&#8201;%), and P3HT (11.6&#8201;%). Notably, p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E exhibits a high cohesive energy density, resulting in enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, thereby conferring perovskite solar cells with exceptional 85&#8201;&#176;C tolerance and operational stability.

         <title>Harmonizing Plasmonic and Photonic Effects to Boost Photocatalytic H2 Production over 550&#8201;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
Plasmonic photonic crystal enables efficient hydrogen evolution from water by harmonizing competing photonic and plasmonic effects to effectively trap and concentrate light onto plasmonic catalysts. This design demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution at 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic catalyst by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other emerging high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with photonic crystals holds immense potential to enhance green hydrogen photosynthesis by amplifying localized electromagnetic field through generating surface plasmons and slow photons. Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor&#8208;based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO2 opal as a non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution, even without needing additional co&#8208;catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.
