         <title>Thiolation for Enhancing Photostability of Fluorophores at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a ~5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50 years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutants cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#183;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180 nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3 times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.058 at 532 nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Isomerization in Radical Copolymerization of Benzyl Vinyl Ether with Pentafluorophenylacrylate Leading to Degradable AAB Periodic Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study revealed benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows the peculiar isomerization propagation in radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying pentafluorophenyl group (PFA).&#160; The comonomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in electron density.&#160; However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving benzyl radical species prior to the propagation with BnVE.&#160; The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA.&#160; Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order of AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11 = 0.174 and r21 = 6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups via alcoholysis and aminolysis post&#8208;polymerization modifications. The unique isomerization in AAB sequence allowed the periodic introduction of benzyl ether structure in the backbone leading to efficient degradation under acid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on doping dyes or photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange via simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8208;guest complex presented effectively enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in dark in 2 hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30 s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of spiropyran to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction achieves a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle due to the intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8208;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the macrocyclic host CB[8] confined guest spiropyran supramolecular shuttle not only modulated reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption</dc:description>

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered&#160;Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral open&#8208;chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile (delta&#160;G activation&#160;(rac)&#160;= 26.6&#8208;28.0 kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline N&#8208;oxide system indicate that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6&#8208;diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by sigma&#8208;bond metathesis between the arene C&#8208;H bond and the Rh&#8208;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8208;C reductive elimination being enantio&#8208;determining and turnover&#8208;limiting. The DFT&#8208;established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies. Significantly, the coupled products of quinoline N&#8208;oxides undergo facile visible light&#8208;induced intramolecular oxygen&#8208;atom transfer, affording chiral epoxides with complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Olefination to Access Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes has been disclosed. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. The chirality of the resulted cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes have received increasing attention for drug discovery and catalyst design. However, the catalytically asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes has been a longstanding challenge. We describe the first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope, providing the planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The ansa chain length scope studies reveal that the chirality of the cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis. The C&#8722;H activation approach is also applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Uncovering Nitrosyl Reactivity at N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nitrosyl derivatives were prepared from redox chemistries of NHC nitric oxide radical ([NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901;). Under electrochemical conditions, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; underwent reversible one&#8208;electron oxidation to lead [NHC&#8722;NO]+ while the reduction led to [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; and was found irreversible. These reactivities were further studied and found to resemble those of transition metal nitrosyl complexes while differing from oxime radicals.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have garnered much attention due to their unique properties, such as strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities, as well as their transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity toward small molecules. In 2015, we discovered that NHCs can react with nitric oxide (NO) gas to form radical adducts that resemble transition metal nitrosyl complexes. To elucidate the analogy between NHC and transition metal NO adducts, here we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer chemistry of [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nitric oxide radical) compounds. We have accessed a suite of compounds, comprised of [NHC&#8722;NO]+, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722;, [NHC&#8722;NOH]0, and [NHC&#8722;NHOH]+ species. In particular, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; was isolated as potassium and lithium ion adducts. Most interestingly, a monomeric potassium [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; compound was isolated with the assistance of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, which is the first instance of a monomeric alkali N&#8208;oxyl compound to the best of our knowledge. Our results demonstrate that [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; exhibits redox behavior broadly similar to metal nitrosyl complexes, which opens up more possibilities for utilizing NHCs to build on the known reactivity of metal complexes.

A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acylation strategy. Starting from readily available acyl chlorides and &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;derived redox&#8208;active esters, the reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, easy scalability, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.







Abstract
A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a decarboxylative acylation strategy. Thus, when an acyl chloride and an &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;containing redox&#8208;active ester are exposed to a nickel catalyst, chiral ligand, and metal reductant, &#945;&#8208;amido ketones are produced in good yield and high ee. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, can be easily scaled up, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.

         <title>A Chiral Emissive Conjugated Macrocycle for High&#8208;Affinity and Highly Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric macrocycles was prepared using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol derivative as the building unit. The conjugated backbone results in the macrocycles having attractive chiral emissive properties, exceptional recognition affinity (up to 1010 M&#8722;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 18.7) in water.







Abstract
Accurately distinguishing between enantiomeric molecules is a fundamental challenge in the field of chemistry. However, there is still significant room for improvement in both the enantiomeric selectivity (KR(S)/KS(R)) and binding strength of most reported macrocyclic chiral receptors to meet the demands of practical application scenarios. Herein, we synthesized a water&#8208;soluble conjugated tubular host&#8212;namely, corral[4]BINOL&#8212;using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derivative as the repeating unit. The conjugated chiral backbone endows corral[4]BINOL with good fluorescent emission (QY=34&#8201;% ) and circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 1.4&#215;10&#8722;3) in water. Notably, corral[4]BINOL exhibits high recognition affinity up to 8.6&#215;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards achiral guests in water, and manifested excellent enantioselectivity up to 18.7 towards chiral substrates, both of which represent the highest values observed among chiral macrocycles in aqueous solution. The ultrastrong binding strength, outstanding enantioselectivity, and facile accessibility, together with the superior fluorescent and chiroptical properties, endow corral[4]BINOL with great potential for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synergistic Nitrogen Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic nitrogen binding site is constructed using adjacent open Cr(III) and F in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). It gives benchmark N2/O2 selectivity and the highest high&#8208;purity oxygen productivity reported to date.







Abstract
Porous materials with d3 electronic configuration open metal sites have been proved to be effective adsorbents for N2 capture and N2/O2 separation. However, the reported materials remain challenging to address the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we report a robust MOF, MIL&#8208;102Cr, that features two binding sites, can synergistically afford strong interactions for N2 capture. The synergistic adsorption site exhibits a benchmark Qst of 45.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for N2 among the Cr&#8208;based MOFs, a record&#8208;high volumetric N2 uptake (31.38&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3), and highest N2/O2 selectivity (13.11) at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar. Breakthrough experiments reveal that MIL&#8208;102Cr can efficiently capture N2 from a 79/21&#8197;N2/O2 mixture, providing a record 99.99&#8201;% pure O2 productivity of 0.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modelling studies revealed that a synergistic adsorption effect by open Cr(III) and fluorine sites was accountable for the strong interactions between the MOF and N2.

         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimide derivatives with excellent stereoselectivities: The reaction was found to exhibit an unusual &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction mode involving the &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon position of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode.







Abstract
A new phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines, in stark contrast to classic cycloaddition reactions, has been developed. This reaction delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimides with excellent stereoselectivities by a new &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction mode involving &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes. Moreover, the present &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction can also be carried out in a one&#8208;pot fashion and scaled up to the gram scale by using aryl aldehydes, without the need to isolate the aryl imines. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the possible mechanism.

         <title>21&#8208;Carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoid Dyads&#8212;An Azepine Unit as a Merging Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently linked selenacarbaporphyrinic dyads exhibit a unique open seashell architecture. These structures were formed via the [5+2] cycloaddition reaction, creating a unifying azepine motif.







Abstract
The oxidation of 10,15&#8208;diaryl&#8208;21&#8208;carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoids resulted in the creation of dyads. The dimerization process follows a [5+2] cycloaddition path with the formation of an azepine unit. The arrays display two direct bonds between the peripheral carbocyclic carbon atoms of one carbaselenaporphyrinic subunit and the central carbon and nitrogen atoms of the second subunit. This results in a unique canted arrangement of two carbaporphyrinoid planes resembling an open seashell&#8208;like motif.

         <title>Significant Strain Dissipation via Stiff&#8208;Tough Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Highly Stable Alloying Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that imparts high stiffness and toughness to a single SEI film was achieved for the first time, providing a novel avenue to amplify both the structural robustness and rate capacity of alloying anodes for lithium&#8208;ion storage.







Abstract
The pulverization of alloying anodes significantly restricts their use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This study presents a dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that incorporates finely dispersed Al nanoparticles within the LiPON matrix. This distinctive dual&#8208;phase structure imparts high stiffness and toughness to the integrated SEI film. In comparison to single&#8208;phase LiPON film, the optimized Al/LiPON dual&#8208;phase SEI film demonstrates a remarkable increase in fracture toughness by 317.8&#8201;%, while maintaining stiffness, achieved through the substantial dissipation of strain energy. Application of the dual&#8208;phase SEI film on an Al anode leads to a 450&#8201;% enhancement in cycling stability for lithium storage in dual&#8208;ion batteries. A similar enhancement in cycling stability for silicon anodes, which face severe volume expansion issues, is also observed, demonstrating the broad applicability of the dual&#8208;phase SEI design. Specifically, homogeneous Li&#8722;Al alloying has been observed in conventional LIBs, even when paired with a high mass loading LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode (7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The dual&#8208;phase SEI film design can also accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Li&#8208;ions through interface electronic structure regulation. This dual&#8208;phase design can integrate stiffness and toughness into a single SEI film, providing a pathway to enhance both the structural stability and rate capability of alloying anodes.

         <title>Diradicaloid Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons Achieved by Pentagon&#8208;Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system has led to the generation of open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped molecular carbons (BMCs). Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the two as&#8208;synthesized BMCs containing a pentagonal ring have local antiaromaticity, an internal quinoidal substructure and thus singlet diradical structures, as well as intriguing properties, such as very broad light absorption and superior photothermal capability.







Abstract
Molecular carbons (MCs) are molecular cutouts of carbon materials. Doping with heteroatoms and constructing open&#8208;shell structures are two powerful approaches to achieve unexpected and unique properties of MCs. Herein, we disclose a new strategy to design open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs), namely by pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system. We synthesized two diradicaloid BMC molecules that feature C24B and C38B &#960;&#8208;skeletons containing a pentagonal ring. A thorough investigation reveals that such pentagon&#8208;fusion not only leads to their local antiaromaticity, but also incorporates an internal quinoidal substructure and thereby induces open&#8208;shell singlet diradical states. Moreover, their fully fused structures enable efficient &#960; conjugation, which is expanded over the whole frameworks. Consequently, some intriguing physical properties are achieved, such as narrow energy gaps, very broad light absorptions, and superior photothermal capability, along with excellent photostability. Notably, the solid of the C38B molecule exhibits absorption that covers the range of 300&#8211;1200&#8197;nm and an efficiency of 93.5&#8201;% for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation, thus demonstrating the potential of diradicaloid BMCs as high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Discrete DNA Valences for Precisely Controlled Transport at the Subcellular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile in situ strategy to precisely control DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window and further demonstrated that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AuNPs show precise valence dependence.







Abstract
Ultrasmall luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with excellent capabilities to cross biological barriers offer great promise in designing intelligent model nanomedicines for investigating structure&#8211;property relationships at the subcellular level. However, the strict surface controllability of ultrasmall AuNPs is challenging because of their small size. Herein, we report a facile in situ method for precisely controlling DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent AuNPs with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window using a phosphorothioate&#8208;modified DNA aptamer, AS1411, as a template. The discrete DNA aptamer number of AS1411&#8208;functionalized AuNPs (AS1411&#8208;AuNPs, &#8776;1.8&#8197;nm) with emission at 1030&#8197;nm was controlled in one aptamer (V1), two aptamers (V2), and four aptamers (V4). It was then discovered that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AS1411&#8208;AuNPs were precisely dependent on valences. A slight increase in valence from V1 to V2 increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and resulted in higher nucleus accumulation, whereas a further increase in valence (e.g., V4) significantly increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and led to higher cytomembrane accumulation. These results provide a basis for the strict surface control of nanomedicines in the precise regulation of in vivo transport at the subcellular level and their translation into clinical practice in the future.

         <title>Dual Catalysis of Gold Nanoclusters: Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling by Cooperation of Superatomic Core and Molecularly Modified Staples
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters were found to show a dual catalysis toward photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions between aliphatic tertiary amines and terminal alkynes to produce propargylamine products. The dual catalysis was enabled by the cooperation of the superatomic core and staple moieties for the photooxidation of amines and the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have attracted significant attention as nano&#8208;catalysts, revealing a superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples as distinct structural units. Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate&#8208;protected [Au25(SR)18]&#8722; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized 1O2 generation by the Au13 superatomic core and catalytic carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation facilitated by Au2(SR)3 staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93&#8201;%. Mixed&#8208;ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalysis.

Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate-protected [Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation by the Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; superatomic core and catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation facilitated by Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross-dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93&#8201;%. Mixed-ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl-exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8722;C bond-forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl-exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand-protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo- and chemo-catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Tunable Phase Behavior and Intrinsic Fluorescence in Dynamically Interacting Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de&#8208;novo rational design of short peptide motifs that assemble into fluorescent condensates with sequence&#8208;dependent phase behavior is investigated. Integrating experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of sidechain solvation, n&#8208;&#960;* interactions, and hydrogen bonding are highlighted through systematic sequence variations on an identical peptide backbone scaffold.







Abstract
A conceptual framework towards understanding biological condensed phases is emerging, derived from biological, biomimetic, and synthetic sequences. However, de novo peptide condensate design remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of the structural and interactive complexity. We designed peptide modules based on a simple repeat motif composed of tripeptide spacers (GSG, SGS, GLG) interspersed with adhesive amino acids (R/H and Y). We show, using sequence editing and a combination of computation and experiment, that n&#8594;&#960;* interactions in GLG backbones are a dominant factor in providing sufficient backbone structure, which in turn regulates the water interface, collectively promoting liquid droplet formation. Moreover, these R(GLG)Y and H(GLG)Y condensates unexpectedly display sequence&#8208;dependent emission that is a consequence of their non&#8208;covalent network interactions, and readily observable by confocal microscopy.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give tetrahydrophenanthrosiloles via 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched by tuning the reaction conditions to give fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give highly fused tetrahydrophenanthrosilole derivatives via unprecedented 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched toward 4&#8208;membered ring&#8208;forming C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation by tuning the reaction conditions to give completely different products, fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives, from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.

         <title>Electric Field Enhanced Ammoxidation of Aldehydes Using Supported Fe Clusters Under Ambient Oxygen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammoxidation of aldehydes under ambient oxygen pressure by external electric field and supported Fe clusters is reported. This ammoxidation system presents high efficiency for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions, rendering it an attractive process for the synthesis of nitriles.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalytic ammoxidation provides an eco&#8208;friendly route for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitrile compounds, which are important precursors for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical applications. However, in general such a process requires high pressures of molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures to accelerate the oxygen reduction and imine dehydrogenation steps, which is highly risky in practical applications. Here, we report an electric field enhanced ammoxidation system using a supported Fe clusters catalyst (Fe/NC), which enables efficient synthesis of nitriles from the corresponding aldehydes under ambient air pressure at room temperature (RT). A synergistic effect between the external electric field and the Fe/NC catalyst promotes the ammonia activation and the dehydrogenation of the generated imine intermediates and avoids the unwanted backwards reaction to aldehydes. This electric field enhanced ammoxidation system presents high efficiency and selectivity for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions with high durability, rendering it an attractive process for the green synthesis of nitriles with fragile functional groups.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Polyhedral Building Blocks into Rhombic Dodecahedral Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the spatial distribution of ligands on polyoxometalates has led to subnanometer rhombic dodecahedral building blocks being obtained. The anisotropy of these sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks results in them self&#8208;assembling into rhombic dodecahedral assemblies, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of subnanometer (sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm) scale polyhedral building blocks can yield some superstructures with novel and interesting morphology as well as potential functionalities. However, achieving the self&#8208;assembly of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm polyhedral building blocks is still a great challenge. Herein, through encapsulating the titanium&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM, K7PTi2W10O40) with tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA+), we first synthesized a sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedral building block by further tailoring the spatial distribution of TBA+ on the POM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the eight TBA+ cations interacted with the POM cluster and formed the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedron. As a result of anisotropy, the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks have self&#8208;assembled into rhombic dodecahedral POM (RD&#8208;POM) assemblies at the microscale. Benefiting from the regular structure, Br&#8722; ions, and abundant active sites, the obtained RD&#8208;POM assemblies exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides without co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides a promising approach to tailor the symmetry and structure of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks by tuning the spatial distribution of ligands, which may shed light on the fabrication of superstructures with novel properties by self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Homoallylic Coupling: Synthesis of Chiral Branched 1,5&#8208;Dienes Featuring a Quaternary Stereogenic Center and Mechanistic Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allylic carbonates under Ni&#8208;catalysis provides access to unique 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring a quaternary stereogenic center under high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control. Mechanistic studies align well with a catalytic cycle based on a Ni(0)/Ni(II) couple with a crucial role for divalent Zn boosting the overall kinetics and selectivity while favoring a key bimetallic C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel&#8208;promoted by reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (rr &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 and with high chemo&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)&#8208;allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross&#8208;electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio- and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5-dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel-promoted by reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (&lt;i&gt;rr&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 and with high chemo- and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)-allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross-electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics on Electrosynthesis and Assembly of Conjugated Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report nanoarchitectonics of end&#8208;on conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated one&#8208;by&#8208;one electrochemical addition and assembly of bifunctional monomers with electroactive oxidation and reduction units under alternative positive and negative potentials. Rapid electrosynthesis can be potentially automated as an electrochemically assisted assembly or printing technique while reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability.







Abstract
In contrast to edge&#8208;on and face&#8208;on orientations, end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated polymers have the theoretical possibility of providing a macroscopic crystalline film. However, their fabrication is insurmountable due to sluggishly thermodynamic equilibrium states. Herein, we report the programmatic pathway to fabricate nanoarchitectonics on end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated simultaneous electrosynthesis and assembly. Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with bottom&#8208;up oriented electroactive molecules as a temple allows orientation, stacking, and reactive addition of monomers triggered by switching alternative redox reactions as well as crystallization of small molecules. Repeating the same reaction can repair the unreactive site on the SAM and dynamically and statistically ensure maximum iterative coverage with ideal linear coefficients between optical or electrical responses and iterative times. The resulting nanoarchitectonics on uniaxially assembled end&#8208;on polymers over centimeter&#8208;sized areas have a subnanometer&#8208;uniform morphology and exhibit ultrahigh modulus as well as an inorganic indium tin oxides and the highest conductance among conjugated molecular monolayers. Their memristive devices provide quantitative electrical and optical responses as a function of molecular length, bias, and iterative junctions. Precise processing of nanoarchitectonics as an electrically assisted assembly or printing technique can present sophisticated optoelectric functions and dimensional batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency for micro&#8208;sized organic materials and electronics.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Alkene&#8208;Alkyne Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedent palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes has been realized. A variety of chiral bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes were prepared in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, the products could undergo an uncommon iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, providing iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters.







Abstract
Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene compounds and derivatives exist in a number of natural products and bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, catalytic enantioselective protocols for the synthesis of these skeletons have not been disclosed. Herein we reported a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes, affording a library of enantionenriched bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (mostly &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the products could undergo an unusual iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, forming iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters. The enone and isolated olefin motifs embedded in the products provide useful handles for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of BiVO4 for Photochemical Sensing of H2S Gas at Ultra&#8208;low Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octadecahedron BiVO4, which was obtained by facet engineering, was employed as a photochemical sensing material for the selective detection of H2S at an ultralow concentration due to its larger proportion of (110) and (011) facets as well as the formation of the additional (111) facets. The insights into the interaction between H2S and BiVO4 under photoactivation were investigated.







Abstract
We report a photochemical bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) sensing material, which possesses a large proportion of (110) and (011) facets combined with the additional (111) facets, for the selective detection of ultra&#8208;low concentration hydrogen sulfide (H2S) driven by visible light. Specifically, the obtained octadecahedron BiVO4 (Octa&#8208;BiVO4) performs a high response value (67) and short response time (47.4&#8197;s) to 100&#8197;ppm H2S with good stability for nearly 100&#8197;days, as well as undisturbedness by moist air. With the combination of experimental and theoretical calculation results, the adsorption and carrier transfer behaviors of H2S molecules on the Octa&#8208;BiVO4 crystal surface are investigated. By adjusting the ratio of different crystal facets and controlling the facets with characteristic adsorption, we achieve improved anisotropic photoinduced carrier separation and high selectivity for a specific gas. Furthermore, this facial facet engineering can be extended to the synthesis of other sensing materials, offering huge opportunities for fundamental research and technological applications.

         <title>Embedding Hydrogen Atom Transfer Moieties in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With embedding of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are endowed with facile generation of alkyl radicals and improved light harvesting abilities. The developed COFs were examined as robust photocatalysts for C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for a wide range of relatively simple organic reactions, whereas their application in complex organic transformations, like site&#8208;selective functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds, is underexplored, which can be mainly attributed to the lack of highly active organophotocatalytic cores. Herein through bonding oxygen atoms at the N&#8208;terminus of quinolines in nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8722;COFs), we successfully realized the embedding of active hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton of COFs. This novel designed COF (NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O), serving as both an excellent photosensitizer and HAT catalyst, exhibited much higher efficiency in C&#8722;H functionalization than the corresponding NQ&#8722;COFE5. Specially, we evaluated the photocatalytic performance of NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O on ten different substrates, including quinolines, benzothiazole, and benzoxazole, all of which were transferred to desired products in moderate to high yields (up to 93&#8201;%). Furthermore, the as&#8208;synthesized NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O displayed excellent photostability and could be reused with negligible loss of activity for five catalytic cycles.

         <title>Fast Antioxidation Kinetics of Glutathione Intracellularly Monitored by a Dual&#8208;Wire Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid kinetics between the glutathione (GSH) system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) remain unclear. We developed a dual&#8208;wire nanosensor that can selectively and synchronously measure intracellular GSH and ROS with a high temporal resolution, and applied it to study resveratrol (RSV)&#8208;treated cancer cells. The GSH system is rapidly triggered by the ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale and works only for a few seconds with some residual ROS.







Abstract
The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual&#8208;wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale, but the elimination process is short&#8208;lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance&#8208;related physiological.

We developed a dual-wire nanosensor that can selectively and synchronously measure intracellular GSH and ROS with a high temporal resolution, and applied it to study resveratrol (RSV)-treated cancer cells. The GSH system is rapidly triggered by the ROS burst in a sub-second time scale and works only for a few seconds with some residual ROS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual-wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub-second time scale, but the elimination process is short-lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance-related physiological.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Free Exciton Emission in a Quasi&#8208;Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural dimensionality and electronic dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the type of excitonic emission in hybrid metal halides (HMHs). It is important but challenging to achieve free exciton (FE) emission in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) HMHs based on the control over the electronic dimensionality. In this work, a quasi&#8208;0D HMH (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 with localized electronic dimensionality is prepared as a prototype model. With increasing pressure onto (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4, the broad and weak self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission at ambient conditions is considerably enhanced before 3.6 GPa, which originates from more distorted [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units upon compression. Notably, a narrow FE emission in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 appears at 3.6 GPa, and then this FE emission is gradually strengthened up to 8.4 GPa. High pressure structural characterizations reveal that anisotropic contraction of (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 results in a noticeable reduction in the distance between adjacent [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units, as well as an obvious enhancement of crystal stiffness. Consequently, the electronic connectivity in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 is sufficiently promoted above 3.6 GPa, which is also supported with theoretical calculations. The elevation of electronic connectivity and enhanced stiffness together lead to pressure&#8208;induced FE emission and subsequent emission enhancement in quasi&#8208;0D (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39% and 20.95% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8208; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8210;H Heteroarylation enabled by an efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#181;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand&#8217;s benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry PdnL2n Nanocages through Coordination&#8208;Sphere Engineering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Often overlooked second coordination sphere effects are shown to be of significant importance in isomer selectivity with self&#8208;assembled, low&#8208;symmetry metal&#8208;organic cages. In some instances, these effects override primary structural factors that are often the only consideration when designing such systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are popular host architectures assembled from ligands and metal ions/nodes. Assembling structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry MOCs with anisotropic cavities can be limited by the formation of statistical isomer libraries. We set out to investigate the use of primary coordination&#8208;sphere engineering (CSE) to bias isomer selectivity within homo&#8208; and heteroleptic PdnL2n cages. Unexpected differences in selectivities between alternative donor groups led us to recognise the significant impact of the second coordination sphere on isomer stabilities. From this, molecular&#8208;level insight into the origins of selectivity between cis and trans diastereoisomers was gained, highlighting the importance of both host&#8211;guest and host&#8208;solvent interactions, in addition to ligand design. This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low&#8208;symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, shape&#8208;shifting MOCs.

This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low-symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli-responsive, shape-shifting MOCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Although long&#8208;lived triplet charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) state with high energy level has gained significant attention, the development of organic small molecules capable of achieving such states remains a major challenge. Herein, by using the through&#8208;space electronic coupling effect, we have developed a compound, namely NIC&#8208;DMAC, which has a long&#8208;lived 3CT state at the single&#8208;molecule level with a lifetime of 210 ms and a high energy level of up to 2.50 eV. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we have elucidated the photophysical processes of NIC&#8208;DMAC, which involves sequential transitions from the first singlet excited state (S1) that shows a 1CT character to the first triplet excited state (T1) that exhibits a local excited state feature (3LE), and then to the second triplet excited state (T2) that shows a 3CT character (i.e., S1 (1CT) &#8594;T1 (3LE) &#8594;T2 (3CT)). The long lifetime and high energy level of its 3CT state has enabled NIC&#8208;DMAC as an initiator for photocuring in double patterning applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of amorphously processable ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient amorphous UL&#8208;RTP remains a challenging task, especially with visible&#8208;light&#8208;activability and bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification in rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a 'four birds with one stone' characteristics in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light with the aid of enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01 s and efficiency up to 35.4% upon a 450 nm excitation) in flexible films using the unique multi&#8208;esterified Coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and flashlight activated afterglow information encryption information technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Phosphor with High Efficiency and Long Lifetime in Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Through Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Triplet Exciton Formation for Photolithography Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, purely organic compounds showing ambient phosphorescence with high efficiency (&#934;P) and ultra&#8208;long lifetime (&#964;P) are quite rare and often need to be achieved in hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hosts. This severely limits their applications. Here, we provide a solution to this issue by constructing an ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyad whose D moiety has not only a long&#8208;lived T1 state to achieve a long &#964;P, but also a Tn state that is close to the S1 state of the dyad to trigger effective spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The rationality of this strategy was validated by a new phosphor OF&#8208;BCz that is able to show a &#964;P of 1.92 s and a &#934;P of 30% even in a less rigid matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Excitingly, OF&#8208;BCz exhibited its potential as both a photocuring initiator and an in situ quality indicator, allowing for the visual detection of defects in photolithographic patterning.</dc:description>

         <title>Defects&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Anchoring on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to improve the photocatalytic activity in N2 fixation to produce ammonia, herein, we proposed a photochemical strategy to fabricate defects, and further deposition of Ru single atoms onto UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) framework. Electron&#8208;metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) were built between Ru single atoms and the support via a covalently bonding. EMSI were capable of accelerating charge transfer between Ru SAs and UiO&#8208;66, which was favorable for highly&#8208;efficiently photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic production rate of ammonia improved from 4.57 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 to 16.28 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with the fabrication of defects onto UiO&#8208;66, and further to 53.28 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with Ru&#8208;single atoms loading. From the DFT results, it was found that d&#8208;orbital electrons of Ru were donated to N2 &#960;&#8727;&#8208;antibonding orbital, facilitating the activation of the N&#8801;N triple bond. A hybrid distal&#8208;alternating reaction pathway was probably occurred for the photocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (single Ru sites decorated onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66), and the first step of hydrogenation of N2 was the reaction determination step. This work shed a light on improving the photocatalytic activity via feasibly anchoring single atoms on MOF, and provided more evidences to understand the reaction mechanism in photocatalytic reduction of N2.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, the exposure of highly&#8208;active nitrogen cation sites has been accomplished by photo&#8208;driven quasi&#8208;topological transformation of a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF), which contributes to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis during the 2&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. The exposed nitrogen cation sites with photo&#8208;enhanced Lewis acidity not only act as the electron&#8208;transfer motor to adjust the inherent charge distribution, powering continuous and stable charge separation, and broadening visible&#8208;light adsorption, but also providing a large number of active sites for O2 adsorption. The optimal catalyst shows a high H2O2 production rate of 11965&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, better than most of the previously reported COF photocatalysts. This work provides new insights for designing photo&#8208;switchable nitrogen cation sites as catalytic centers toward efficient solar to chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Intramolecular Olefin Oxyamination to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrene&#8208;mediated asymmetric intramolecular olefin difunctionalization is introduced, in which the nitrene intermediate adds in an unprecedented exocyclic fashion and the nucleophile in an endocyclic fashion. This atom&#8208;economic strategy affords chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities and provides access to versatile chiral building blocks.







Abstract
Attaching a nitrene precursor to an intramolecular nucleophile allows for a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular oxyamination of alkenes in which the nucleophile adds in an endocyclic position and the amine in an exocyclic fashion. Using chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalysts, chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones containing a quaternary carbon in &#947;&#8208;position are provided in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations support the possibility of both a singlet (concerted oxyamination of the alkene) and triplet pathway (stepwise oxyamination) for the formation of the predominant stereoisomer. &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones are versatile chiral building blocks and can be converted to other heterocycles such as &#948;&#8208;lactams, 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, and tetrahydrofurans.

         <title>Irreparable Interphase Chemistry Degradation Induced by Temperature Pulse in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sudden operating temperature change (T pulse) results in a faster capacity fade of graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (Gr|NMC811) pouch full cells. Comprehensive post&#8208;mortem analyses unveil that the T pulse mainly causes a deterioration of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture and chemistry, which in turn accelerates anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase degradation due to aggregated chemical crossover from the cathode during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
While it is widely recognized that the operating temperature significantly affects the energy density and cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the consequence of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry to sudden environmental temperature changes remains inadequately understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of a temperature pulse (T pulse) on the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) pouch full cells. By utilizing advanced characterization tools, such as time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, we reveal that the T pulse can lead to an irreversible degradation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry and architecture. Despite negligible immediate impacts on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anode, aggregated cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover gradually degrades the SEI by catalyzing electrolyte reduction decomposition and inducing metallic dead Li formation because of insufficient cathode passivation after the T pulse. Consequently, pouch cells subjected to the T pulse show an inferior cycle stability to those free of the T pulse. This work unveils the effects of sudden temperature changes on the interphase chemistry and cell performance, emphasizing the importance of a proper temperature management in assessing performance.

         <title>Engineering Fluorine&#8208;rich Double Protective Layer on Zn Anode for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer on the Zn anode is in situ built by the cross&#8208;linking and decomposition of tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) electrolyte additive, which can not only balance space electric field and control the Zn2+ ion flux to achieve the compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes but also block the direct contact of active water and the Zn anode to suppress side reactions, leading to high&#8208;performance AZIBs.







Abstract
The high thermodynamic instability and side reactions of Zn&#8208;metal anode (ZMA), especially at high current densities, greatly impede the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer strategy is proposed to obtain the high reversibility of AZIBs through the introduction of a versatile tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) additive in aqueous electrolyte. TDFND molecule with large adsorption energy (&#8722;1.51&#8197;eV) preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode surface to form a Zn(OR)2&#8722; (R=&#8722;CH2&#8722;(CF2)7&#8722;CH2&#8722;) cross&#8208;linking complex network, which balances space electric field and controls the Zn2+ ion flux, thus enabling the uniform and compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes. Meanwhile, TDFND with low Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 0.10&#8197;eV) energy level is priorly decomposed to regulate the interfacial chemistry of ZMA by building a ZnF2&#8208;rich solid electrode/electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. It is found that a 14&#8197;nm&#8208;thick SEI layer delivers excellent structural integrity to suppress parasitic reactions by blocking the direct contact of active water and ZMA. Consequently, the Zn electrode exhibits a superior cycling life over 430&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a 68&#8197;mAh pouch cell delivers 80.3&#8201;% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.

         <title>Guiding Zn Uniform Deposition with Polymer Additives for Long&#8208;lasting and Highly Utilized Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the interactions between zwitterionic polymer additive and Zn anode can construct an in situ formed uniform protective layer on Zn metal to resist side reactions and guide the Zn even deposition and nucleation along 002 plane, thus rendering the symmetrical Zn//Zn battery and Zn full devices with great performance at high Zn utilization.







Abstract
The parasitic side reaction on Zn anode is the key issue which hinders the development of aqueous Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems on power&#8208;grid applications. Here, a polymer additive (PMCNA) engineered by copolymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) was employed to regulate the Zn deposition environment for satisfying side reaction inhibition performance during long&#8208;term cycling with high Zn utilization. The PMCNA can preferentially adsorb on Zn metal surface to form a uniform protective layer for effective water molecule repelling and side reaction resistance. In addition, the PMCNA can guide Zn nucleation and deposition along 002 plane for further side reaction and dendrite suppression. Consequently, the PMCNA additive can enable the Zn//Zn battery with an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 90.0&#8201;% for over 420&#8197;h, the Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitor with long cycling lifespan, and the Zn//PANI battery with Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% at low N/P ratio of 2.6.

         <title>Adapting Synthetic Models of Heme/Cu Sites to Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex is synthesized by hanging a CoII ion over a Co corrole unit. This bioinspired complex realizes the four&#8208;electron electrocatalytic O2 reduction with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which represents an outstanding activity for molecular electrocatalysts. By mimicking the function of the CuI ion in biological heme/Cu sites, the hanging CoII ion provides an electron to improve O2 binding and activation.







Abstract
In nature, cytochrome c oxidases catalyze the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which CuI is used to assist O2 activation. Because of the thermodynamic barrier to generate CuI, synthetic Fe&#8208;porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex 1&#8208;Co for energy&#8208;efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a CoII ion over Co corrole, 1&#8208;Co realizes electrocatalytic 4e&#8722; ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably, 1&#8208;Co outperforms Co corrole hanged with CuII or ZnII. We revealed that the hanging CoII ion can provide an electron to improve O2 binding thermodynamically and dynamically, a function represented by the biological CuI ion of the heme/Cu site. This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second&#8208;sphere redox&#8208;active metal ion in promoting O2 binding and activation.

This bioinspired complex realizes the four-electron electrocatalytic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with a half-wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which represents an outstanding activity for molecular electrocatalysts. By mimicking the function of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ion in biological heme/Cu sites, the hanging Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion provides an electron to improve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and activation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidases catalyze the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is used to assist O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Because of the thermodynamic barrier to generate Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;, synthetic Fe-porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co-corrole/Co complex &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; for energy-efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion over Co corrole, &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; realizes electrocatalytic 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole-based electrocatalysts. Notably, &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; outperforms Co corrole hanged with Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; or Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. We revealed that the hanging Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion can provide an electron to improve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding thermodynamically and dynamically, a function represented by the biological Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ion of the heme/Cu site. This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second-sphere redox-active metal ion in promoting O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Synergy between Fe and Mo Sites in the Nitrate Reduction Reaction on a Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic MXene Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active sites of the nitrate reductase enzymes, Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe, is studied here and found to display unique performances in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia, outperforming its monometallic counterpart Mo2CTx. In situ XAS and DFT calculations reveal that this difference in reactivity results from the vacancy&#8208;formation&#8208;promoting effect of Fe sites in Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe.







Abstract
Mo&#8208; and Fe&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the reduction of nitrate and nitrite ions in nature. Inspired by this activity, we study here the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) catalyzed by an Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide of the MXene family, viz., Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe (Tx are oxo, hydroxy and fluoro surface termination groups). Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe contains isolated Fe sites in Mo positions of the host MXene (Mo2CTx) and features a Faradaic efficiency (FE) and an NH3 yield rate of 41&#8201;% and 3.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, respectively, for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH4+ in acidic media and 70&#8201;% and 12.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 in neutral media. Regardless of the media, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe outperforms monometallic Mo2CTx owing to a more facile reductive defunctionalization of Tx groups, as evidenced by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Mo K&#8208;edge). After surface reduction, a Tx vacancy site binds a nitrate ion that subsequently fills the vacancy site with O* via oxygen transfer. Density function theory calculations provide further evidence that Fe sites promote the formation of surface O vacancies, which are identified as active sites and that function in NO3RR in close analogy to the prevailing mechanism of the natural Mo&#8208;based nitrate reductase enzymes.

         <title>Spatial Distribution of Nitrogen Binding Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Selective Ethane Adsorption and One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;Organic framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, which incorporates benzimidazole into MOF&#8208;808, features two dispersed nitrogen atoms. It demonstrates remarkable performance in the one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures. The strategically positioned active sites create an optimal geometry, facilitating the efficient entrapment of ethane molecules through the formation of multiple robust C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures containing ethane (C2H6) and acetylene (C2H2) is an industrially important yet challenging process. In this work, we present a site&#8208;engineering strategy aimed at manipulating the spatial distribution of binding sites within a confined pore space. We realized successfully by incorporating nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, such as indole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Ind), benzimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Bzz), and indazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Izo), into the robust MOF&#8208;808 platform via post&#8208;synthetic modification. The resulting functionalized materials, namely MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Ind, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, and MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Izo, demonstrated significantly improved selectivity for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz with two uniformly distributed nitrogen binding sites gave the optimal geometry for selective ethane trapping through multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds, leading to the highest C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 combined selectivities among known MOFs. Column breakthrough experiments validated its ability to purify C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures in a single step.

         <title>Localized Anion&#8208;Cation Aggregated Aqueous Electrolytes with Accelerated Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous electrolytes using Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and THF as the diluent are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of Zn&#8208;metal batteries. THF promotes the anion&#8208;cation aggregation and disrupts H&#8208;bond network, resulting in ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and facilitating the desolvation process at low temperatures.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, rich material resources and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolytes hinders low&#8208;temperature operation of the batteries. Here, aqueous localized anion&#8208;cation aggregated electrolytes composed of Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the diluent, are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of the Zn anode. THF promotes the inclusion of BF4&#8722; in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, facilitating the formation of ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. THF also affects the hydrogen bonding between neighboring H2O molecules, effectively lowering the freezing point. Therefore, the full cells of Zn||polyaniline (PANI) exhibit an ultralong cycle life of 8000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the pouch cells display a high capacity retention of 86.2&#8201;% after 500 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which demonstrates the great prospect of such electrolytes in cold regions. This work provides new insights for the design of low&#8208;temperature aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol in Water on ZnO&#8208;Supported CuAu Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation using green hydrogen is currently a well&#8208;established goal for controlling global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We show that CO2 can be selectively reduced to methanol in liquid&#8208;water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, whose structure and electronic properties were elucidated using electron microscopy, 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray absorption, and ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies.







Abstract
Optimizing processes and materials for the valorization of CO2 to hydrogen carriers or platform chemicals is a key step for mitigating global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We report here on the hydrogenation of CO2 in water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, based on &#8804;7&#8197;mol&#8201;% Au. CuxAuy/ZnO catalysts were characterized using 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (Au LIII&#8208; and Cu K&#8208;edges), and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron (APXP) spectroscopic methods together with X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. At 200&#8201;&#176;C, the conversion of CO2 showed a significant increase by 34&#8197;times (from 0.1 to 3.4&#8201;%) upon increasing Cu93Au7 loading from 1 to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%, while maintaining methanol selectivity at 100&#8201;%. Limited CO selectivity (4&#8211;6&#8201;%) was observed upon increasing temperature up to 240&#8201;&#176;C but associated with a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in CO2 conversion. Based on APXPS during CO2 hydrogenation in an H2O&#8208;rich mixture, Cu segregates preferentially to the surface in a mainly metallic state, while slightly charged Au submerges deeper into the subsurface region. These results and detailed structural analyses are topics of the present contribution.

         <title>Exploitation of Catalytic Dyads by Short Peptide&#8208;Based Nanotubes for Enantioselective Covalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide&#8208;based amyloid nanotubes were able to demonstrate enantioselective covalent catalysis by exploiting chiral binding pockets with multiple solvent exposed residues. To achieve this, lysine was used for reversible imine formation, leucine for hydrophobic binding surface, and imidazole for the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrates.







Abstract
Extant enzymes with precisely arranged multiple residues in their three&#8208;dimensional binding pockets are capable of exhibiting remarkable stereoselectivity towards a racemic mixture of substrates. However, how early protein folds that possibly featured short peptide fragments facilitated enantioselective catalytic transformations important for the emergence of homochirality still remains an intriguing open question. Herein, enantioselective hydrolysis was shown by short peptide&#8208;based nanotubes that could exploit multiple solvent&#8208;exposed residues to create chiral binding grooves to covalently interact and subsequently hydrolyse one enantiomer preferentially from a racemic pool. Single or double&#8208;site chiral mutations led to opposite but diminished and even complete loss of enantioselectivities, suggesting the critical roles of the binding enthalpies from the precise localization of the active site residues, despite the short sequence lengths. This work underpins the enantioselective catalytic prowess of short peptide&#8208;based folds and argues their possible role in the emergence of homochiral chemical inventory.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Metallacycle for Orthogonal Multimode Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of multimode photopatterning systems based on supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) is considerably attractive in supramolecular chemistry and materials science, because SCCs can serve as promising platforms for the incorporation of multiple functional building blocks. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle that is constructed via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. By exploiting its fascinating liquid crystal feature, bright emission properties, and facile photocyclization capability, a unique system with spatially&#8208;controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) is built through the introduction of a photochromic spiropyran derivative, which enables us to realize the first example of a liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle for orthogonal photopatterning in three&#8208;modes, namely holography, fluorescence and photochromism.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8208;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+ = [CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+ = Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90%~100%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.</dc:description>

Efficient strategies for heterocyclic ring expansion to access heterocycles containing a fluoroalkyl quaternary carbon center through fluoroalkyl carbene insertion are highly desirable because of their broad applications in medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a general strategy for the dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion of azoles using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as fluoroalkyl carbene precursors, resulting in ring&#8208;expanded heterocycles in excellent yields and good functional group compatibility. The broad generality of this methodology in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically interesting bioactive molecules and versatile transformations of the products has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes' thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8211;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8211;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from non&#8208;specific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, meanwhile encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. As a result, our approach constructed a cascade reaction system, leveraging enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8211;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in catalytic performance compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Component Arene Difunctionalization: Merger of C(sp3)/(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem three&#8208;component C&#8722;H bond addition involving the activation of an inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been developed. The process enables the direct regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized arenes with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722; and C(sp2)&#8722;C(arene) bonds from readily available precursors. The sulfoximine plays a key role in this double functionalization of 2&#8208;iodo benzoic acids as masked bifunctional reagents.







Abstract
A tandem three&#8208;component C&#8722;H bond addition involving the activation of an inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is reported. The process enables the direct regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized arenes with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722; and C(sp2)&#8722;C(arene) bonds. 2&#8208;Iodobenzoic acid derivatives behave as masked bifunctional reagent (BFR) and react with 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;methyl sulfoximine (MPyS) protected aliphatic acids bearing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted groups, and alkenes to produce &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;alkenyl amide derivatives in a single operation. The transformation involves Pd(II)/Pd(IV) and Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalytic systems. Detailed mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal the formation of large T&#8208;shaped palladacycles and the onset of a 1,2&#8208;palladium migration via decarboxylation.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated Au(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8208;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt; 4 ppb, &lt; 1 s, and &lt; 5 s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Robust yet Deconstructable and Chemically Recyclable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;Like Materials Based on Si&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional silyl ether (BSE)&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials have been synthesized under mild polymerization and hydrogenation conditions. Both the concentration of BSEs in the polymer chain and the silicon steric bulk can be tuned to yield materials with HDPE&#8208;like thermomechanical properties. The materials undergo two distinct deconstruction pathways and can be recycled without compromising their mechanical strength.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced synthetic polymer. By installing chemically cleavable bonds into the backbone of PE, it is possible to produce chemically deconstructable PE derivatives; to date, however, such designs have primarily relied on carbonyl&#8208; and olefin&#8208;related functional groups. Bifunctional silyl ethers (BSEs; SiR2(OR&#8242;2)) could expand the functional scope of PE mimics as they possess strong Si&#8722;O bonds and facile chemical tunability. Here, we report BSE&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials synthesized through a one&#8208;pot catalytic ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and hydrogenation sequence. The crystallinity of these materials can be adjusted by varying the BSE concentration or the steric bulk of the Si&#8208;substituents, providing handles to control thermomechanical properties. Two methods for chemical recycling of HDPE mimics are introduced, including a circular approach that leverages acid&#8208;catalyzed Si&#8722;O bond exchange with 1&#8208;propanol. Additionally, despite the fact that the starting HDPE mimics were synthesized by chain&#8208;growth polymerization (ROMP), we show that it is possible to recover the molar mass and dispersity of recycled HDPE products using step&#8208;growth Si&#8722;O bond formation or exchange, generating high molecular weight recycled HDPE products with mechanical properties similar to commercial HDPE.

         <title>Triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl Sites for Superior Photocatalytic Molecular Oxygen Activation and NO Oxidation of BiOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites can selectively promote one&#8208;electron molecular oxygen activation to superoxide radicals for enhanced NO photooxidation of BiOCl, producing NO3&#8722; with a strong bidentate adsorption configuration to avoid unfavorable photolysis.







Abstract
BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO2 emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites on a Cl&#8208;terminated, (001) facet&#8208;exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one&#8208;electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO3&#8722; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis. By simultaneously tuning intermediates and products, the Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl&#8208;landen BiOCl achieved &gt;90&#8201;% NO conversion to favorable NO3&#8722; of high selectivity (&gt;97&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;min under visible light, with the undesired NO2 concentration below 20&#8197;ppb. Both the activity and the selectivity of Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites surpass those of BiOCl surface sites (38&#8201;% NO conversion, 67&#8201;% NO3&#8722; selectivity) or control O&#8722;Ag1&#8722;O sites on a benchmark photocatalyst P25 (67&#8201;% NO conversion and 87&#8201;% NO3&#8722; selectivity). This study develops new single&#8208;atom sites for the performance enhancement of semiconductor photocatalysts, and also provides a facile pathway to manipulate the reactive oxygen species production for efficient pollutant removal.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report the first ultrasoundresponsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on singlecomponent sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, the sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8208;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8208;C bond cleavage as the key step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often results from light&#8208;induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light stimuli. Utilizing light as a trigger for the manipulation of biomolecular structure and function offers numerous advantages compared to other stimuli, such as chemical or electrical treatments, due to its non&#8208;invasive nature. Consequently, light proves particularly advantageous in cellular and tissue applications. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the design principles of different classes of photochromes, synthetic strategies, critical analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8208;property relationships. The applications of photochromic nucleic acid derivatives encompass diverse domains, ranging from the precise photoregulation of gene expression to the controlled modulation of the three&#8208;dimensional structures of oligonucleotides and the development of DNA&#8208;based fluorescence modulators. Moreover, we present a future perspective on potential modifications and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjustable Plane Curvature of Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Outstanding Dielectric, Electret, and High&#8208;Temperature Processing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid development of integrated circuits towards miniaturization and complexity, there is an urgent need for materials with low dielectric constant/loss and high processing temperatures to effectively prevent signal delay and crosstalk. With high porosity, thermal stability, and easy structural modulation, covalent organic frameworks have great potential in the field of low dielectric materials. However, the optimization of dielectric properties by modulating the conjugated/plane curvature structure of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has rarely been reported. Accordingly, we herein innovatively prepare COF films with adjustable planar curvature, hence possessing ultralow dielectric constant (1.9 at 1 kHz), ultralow dielectric loss at 1 kHz (0.0029 at room temperature, 0.0052 at 200 &#176;C), high thermal decomposition temperature (5% weight loss temperature, 473 &#176;C) and good hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 105.3&#176;). Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the resulting COF film enables high surface potential (~320 V) for one week, attributing to its intrinsic high porosity, thus presenting great potential in electret applications. Accordingly, this innovative work provides a readily available and scalable idea to prepare materials with comprehensively excellent dielectric and electret properties as well as high processing temperatures simultaneously for advanced electronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Photoswitching of Diphosphene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically and thermally reversible photoisomerization of &#951;2&#8208; to &#951;1&#8208;diphosphene complexes is described. The origins of this remarkable photochromic behavior lie in the S1 excited state, as elucidated by theoretical studies. The findings underscore the potential of previously overlooked transition metal diphosphene complexes, revealing their promising photochromic properties and distinctive photoswitching behavior.







Abstract
Although diphosphene transition metal complexes are known to undergo E to Z isomerization upon irradiation with UV light, their potential for photoswitching has remained poorly explored. In this study, we present diphosphene complexes capable of reversible photoisomerizations through haptotropic rearrangements. The compounds [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Mo(CO)2][OTf] (3&#8201;a[OTf]), [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Fe(CO)][OTf] (3&#8201;b[OTf]), and [(2&#8208;&#954;2P)Fe(CO)4][OTf] (4[OTf]) were prepared using the triflate salt [(LC)P=P(Dipp)][OTf] (2[OTf) as a precursor (LC=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl, OTf=triflate). Upon exposure to blue or UV light (&#955;=400&#8197;nm, 470&#8197;nm), the initially red&#8208;colored &#951;2&#8208;diphosphene complexes 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] readily undergo isomerization to form blue&#8208;colored &#951;1&#8208;complexes [(2&#8208;&#954;1P,&#954;6C)M(CO)n][OTf] (5&#8201;a,b[OTf]; a: M=Mo, n=2; b: M=Fe, n=1). This haptotropic rearrangement is reversible, and the (&#954;2P,&#954;6C)&#8208;coordination mode gradually reverts back upon dissolution in coordinating solvents or more rapidly upon exposure to yellow or red irradiation (&#955;=590&#8197;nm, 630&#8197;nm). The electronic reasons for the reversible visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoswitching observed for 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] are elucidated by DFT calculations. These calculations indicate that the photochromic isomerization originates from the S1 excited state and proceeds through a conical intersection.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host have been prepared and used to stain living cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging for the first time. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells indicate the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.







Abstract
Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic host has been synthesised. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic visualization of single thiophene probes was performed to recognize single framework Al T&#8208;sites with atomic resolution, and reveal the bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonding behaviors of single thiophenes at confined acid T&#8208;sites in zeolites.







Abstract
The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Organelle Corrects Microenvironment Interference for Accurate Intratumoral Glucose Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle is reported by immobilizing enzymes within porous coordination polymers. The acid&#8208;digested bi&#8208;enzyme cascade core shows boosted catalytic efficiency for sensitive signal transduction, while the stable shell integrating catalase not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic state to maximize glucose oxidation, enabling accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.







Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.

Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 immobilized glucose oxidase-horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase-directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid-digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is in situ decomposed to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene can be photopolymerized in dispersion using visible light and an optimized photo&#8208;initiating system, overcoming light scattering by the growing objects. Stable latexes with particle diameters up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m were obtained using poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer. This represents a fourfold increase in the largest particle size ever reached by a photochemical process in a dispersed medium.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350&#8197;nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.

         <title>Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described the first example of crystalline materials in which bulky iptycene derivatives (triptycene and pentiptycene) exhibit rotational dynamics in the solid state. It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave NHC ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable further design of systems in which large and complicated molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.







Abstract
Molecular motion in the solid state is typically precluded by the highly dense environment, and only molecules with a limited range of sizes show such dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the solid&#8208;state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 219&#8197;&#197;3) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid&#8208;state molecular rotors (9.5&#8197;&#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 361&#8197;&#197;3; rotational diameter: 13.0&#8197;&#197;) surpasses this record. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state 2H spin&#8208;echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three&#8208;fold rotation, while temperature&#8208;dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of biaryl monophosphines has been successfully accomplished with exceptional efficacy and remarkable functional group tolerance. Importantly, this transformation was achieved without the need for external photosensitizers, by synergistically combining visible light photoredox catalysis and P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation. Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

         <title>2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly symmetric 2D plasmonic molecules were assembled through hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (donor and acceptor). Polymer interaction and solvation were found to compete with each other during the colloidal self&#8208;assembly process, which can be used to precisely control the coordination number. The nanostructures rearrange themselves from 3D to 2D when being cast onto a substrate.







Abstract
The use of macromolecular design features to regulate non&#8208;covalent bonding on the nanoscale is a young and emerging fabrication strategy for advanced nanostructures. For the first time, we describe a self&#8208;assembly method to create a series of 2D plasmonic molecules (PMs) using hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor). Due to the nature of hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, we found that polymer interaction and solvation compete with each other during the self&#8208;assembly process, which turns out to be the most important condition for controlling the coordination number of PMs. We have conducted an extensive study on the solvent effect, which has helped us to design and fabricate a series of precise PMs with high symmetry.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo&#8208;functionalized hosts with different rigid skeletons were successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;controlled distances of the recognition sites within the hydrophobic cavities enable the highly selective recognition of structurally similar guests. This approach presents a viable solution for achieving the precise recognition of specific guests in aqueous environments through adjustments in the distance of recognition sites.







Abstract
Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity&#8212;especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates&#8212;with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy involving the combination of different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance between recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for the highly selective recognition of hydrogen&#8208;bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity through hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on the binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.

A library of Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared by a practical strategy to probe the impact of Ser phosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern was found to play a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but did not significant affect sequence specificity. The insight gained on the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation sheds light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15&#8201;% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated analogues at Ser2/Ser11 as well as fluorescently labeled variants through native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in the DNA&#8208;binding activity of Max. Furthermore, in vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with the DNA sequence specificity of Max. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max&#8242;s phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst
</title>

         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO2 as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on&#8208;line setup showed the high valence state of IrIV worked as active species.







Abstract
For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO2 and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO2&#8208;formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. During charging&#8208;discharging, in situ fluorescence X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy based on an online setup indicated that the active species was in a high valence state of IrIV.

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Activity And Stability of Single&#8208; And Di&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the O2 Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A computational screening method to identify single&#8208; and di&#8208;atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction with metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces is presented. We have performed a three&#8208;step screening study to explore the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability of the catalysts using first&#8208;principles simulations.







Abstract
Efficient and inexpensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we designed a computational catalyst&#8208;screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces for the ORR. Based on formation&#8208;energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and fifteen di&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates, MnMn, FeFe, CoCo, and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells

IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto-inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin-derived covalent activity-based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;) as a small molecule pan-DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non-toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. &lt;b&gt;IMP-2373&lt;/b&gt; thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease-relevant phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and excellent stability maintained even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented three&#8208;component reaction building on palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkylative cyclization between an aminoenyne, an aldehyde and a boronic acid or diphenylsilane is developed. This provides a facile access to multisubstituted exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5 to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in a regioselective and stereodivergent fashion.







Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delocalized isoelectronic heterojunction catalyst (DIHC) is constructed by substituting isoelectronic S for O to further complement the heterojunction theory. With the formation of the more catalytic sites in the DIHC, the catalytic behaviors at the heterojunction interface are regulated to realize the continuous capture&#8212;adsorption&#8212;catalysis of Li2Sn, thus improving the sulfur reaction kinetics and performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV/Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17&#8197;days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Coupling Promoting Directional Photosynthesis of Nitrate from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;plasmon coupling structure (Bi/CsxWO3) generates a localized electromagnetic field enhancement to improve the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers, which facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes, thereby boosting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules into nitrates under mild conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis, particularly plasmon&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, offers a green and sustainable approach for direct nitrogen oxidation into nitrate under ambient conditions. However, the unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency caused by the limited localized electromagnetic field enhancement and short hot carrier lifetime of traditional plasmonic catalysts is a stumbling block to the large&#8208;scale application of plasmon photocatalytic technology. Herein, we design and demonstrate the dual&#8208;plasmonic heterojunction (Bi/CsxWO3) achieves efficient and selective photocatalytic N2 oxidation. The yield of NO3&#8722; over Bi/CsxWO3 (694.32&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) are 2.4&#8197;times that over CsxWO3 (292.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation. The surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8901;OH and the activation of N2. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO3&#8722;, which achieves the overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Na/Cl2 Batteries Through Improved Electron and Ion Transport by Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Na/Cl2 battery with an ultrahigh rate capability (16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) has been realized using a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which enables efficient Na+ and electron transport and promoted Cl2 adsorption and conversion. It provides a new paradigm to solve the dilemma between energy density and power density in energy storage devices.







Abstract
Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na+ and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 250&#8197;cycles, respectively. This study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing a BET surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <title>Super&#8208;fast Charging Biohybrid Batteries through a Power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity Process by Combining Microbial Electrochemistry and CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the cutting&#8208;edge advancements in microbial electrochemistry and CO2 electrolysis, a revolutionary biohybrid battery is developed. This biohybrid battery stands out for its remarkable super&#8208;fast charging and long&#8208;duration discharging capabilities. Moreover, the recovered bioelectricity from this battery can be utilized to assess water biotoxicity.







Abstract
Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super&#8208;fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim&#8208;catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3&#8208;minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25&#8208;hour discharging phase. In the power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164&#8197;hours under Gas Stand&#8208;By model, by storing N2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand&#8208;by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.

Moreover, the recovered bioelectricity from this battery can be utilized to assess water biotoxicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, a super-fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyser with a slim-catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3-minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25-hour discharging phase. In the power-to-formate-to-bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164&#8197;hours under Gas Stand-By model, by storing N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas in the extraction chamber during stand-by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus&lt;/i&gt; was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvating power describes the strength of ion&#8208;dipole interaction, which is not necessarily related to the coordination number. The solvation structure originates from the competition between ion&#8208;ion interaction and ion&#8208;dipole interaction. With the similar strength of ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, more anions enter the solvation sheath and form a stable electrode interface.







Abstract
The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that the anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li+ provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed&#8208;solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd nanoparticles were fixed in the SnOx&#8208;containing zeolite, exhibiting superior performance in directly producing hydrogen peroxide rather than water from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation of the O&#8722;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8722;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts and further motivates the use of oxidation&#8208;resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction can effectively reinforce sodium metal anodes (SMAs). The synergistic collaboration between inorganic and organic components in SEI leverages their respective strengths, contributing to dendrite&#8208;free SMAs and prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8722;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anode during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8722;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000&#8197;hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8&#8197;mV at a high current density of 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8722;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>

Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Cephalotanin B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessing an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is a structurally unusual member of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids, natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological properties.

Abstract
Cephalotaxus diterpenoids are attractive natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological features. As a structurally unusual member, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B possesses an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B based on a divergent asymmetric Michael addition reaction, a novel Pauson&#8211;Khand/deacyloxylation process discovered in the development of a second&#8208;generation stereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction protocol, and an epoxide&#8208;opening/elimination/dual&#8208;lactonization cascade to construct the challenging propeller&#8208;shaped A&#8211;B&#8211;C ring system as key transformations.

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>

A protocol for activated bioorthogonal fluorescence labeling and imaging of 4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in plants is developed.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60 and C70 Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAC&#8208;2 (Br substituted) instead of PAC&#8208;3 (CH3 substituted) exhibit fullerene encapsulation, and selective capture of C70 in various carbon soot. The induced chiroptical properties of C60 and C70 by R/S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and new mirror&#8208;symmetry CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes.







Abstract
Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8211;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catenanes have been shown to be capable of anion transport across a lipid bilayer. The catenanes convergently encapsulate Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; via halogen and hydrogen bonding motifs, markedly enhancing the binding affinity and membrane transport efficiency for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; relative to constituent macrocycles. The catenanes also showed exceptional transport selectivity for chloride over OH&#8722; and oxoanion NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components.

&lt;p&gt;Catenanes have been shown to be capable of anion transport across a lipid bilayer. The catenanes convergently encapsulate Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; via halogen and hydrogen bonding motifs, markedly enhancing the binding affinity and membrane transport efficiency for Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; relative to constituent macrocycles. The catenanes also showed exceptional transport selectivity for chloride over OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and oxoanion NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template-directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all-neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous-organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes additionally displayed an anti-Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma-hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustained Hydrogen Spillover on Pt/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy: Dynamic Insights into Gas&#8208;Induced Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>

Collisions between H2 and adsorbed H atoms at the Pt site play a pivotal role in promoting hydrogen spillover, underscoring the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates in elucidating chemical processes under a gas atmosphere.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen&#8208;involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic&#8208;scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine&#8208;learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H2 dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H2 and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Phomactin Platelet Activating Factor Antagonist Requires a Two&#8208;Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of diverse phomactins in nature only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA catalyzes the conversion of GGPP into phomactatriene, while PhmC, in a sequential manner, orchestrates the oxidation of multiple sites within phomactatriene. This finely coordinated enzymatic cascade ultimately results in the production of a fascinating array of structurally diverse phomactins.







Abstract
Phomactin diterpenoids possess a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton with multiple oxidative modifications, and are good platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF) antagonists that can inhibit PAF&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we identified the gene cluster (phm) responsible for the biosynthesis of phomactins from a marine fungus, Phoma sp. ATCC 74077. Despite the complexity of their structures, phomactin biosynthesis only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA was found to catalyze the formation of the phomactatriene, while PhmC sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of multiple sites, leading to the generation of structurally diverse phomactins. The rearrangement mechanism of the diterpene scaffold was investigated through isotope labeling experiments. Additionally, we obtained the crystal complex of PhmA with its substrate analogue FGGPP and elucidated the novel metal&#8208;ion&#8208;binding mode and enzymatic mechanism of PhmA through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. This study provides the first insight into the biosynthesis of phomactins, laying the foundation for the efficient production of phomactin natural products using synthetic biology approaches.

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrowband blue emitter with low&#8208;lying the highest occupied molecular orbital level was developed by decorating the multiple resonance core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which suppresses hole trapping effect for facilitating hole transport and avoiding exciton quenching. The optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence device simultaneously obtains record high external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 16.6&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40&#8197;eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20&#8197;eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6&#8197;nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;Alkylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles via Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed enabled by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. The reaction provides the N&#8208;alkyl indoles with a newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. N&#8208;Alkyl indoles with newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom are produced in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Importantly, both &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl diazoacetates are tolerated, which is extremely rare in asymmetric X&#8722;H (X=N, O, S et&#8197;al.) and C&#8722;H insertion reactions. With this method, only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of rhodium catalyst and 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral phosphoric acid are required to complete the conversion as well as achieve the high enantioselectivity. Computational studies reveal the cooperative relay of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid, and the origin of the chemo and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;Regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a sonosensitizer by using superlattices for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with sonication&#8208;triggered drug release. Introducing Fe(III) through coordinated interactions and changing the Fe(III) content can efficiently enhance and modulate the band gap and improve the outcomes of SDT. Benefiting from the use of Fe(III) as a contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;guided and synergistic therapy can be realized.







Abstract
Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable band gaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesized, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8722;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realize the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the band gap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitizers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customized treatments.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent (&#8722;NO2) strategy is reported to construct J&#8208;type aggregates with boosted NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type movement via increased electrostatic repulsion as well as facilitate intermolecular tight stacking by hydrogen bond. This method can be used to manipulate different kinds of organic fluorophores to obtain enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state.







Abstract
Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8722;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065&#8197;nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21&#8201;% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8722;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Entropy Confinement Promotes Hydrogenolysis Activity for Polyethylene Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamically unstable adsorption of macromolecular chains on the catalyst surface poses a challenge to the chemical recycling of waste plastics. This work provides an approach that involves the implementation of a space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy to mitigate the conformational entropy of the macromolecular chains, ultimately leading to the stabilization of the transition state and a substantial enhancement in catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling that catalyzes waste plastics back to high&#8208;purity chemicals holds great promise in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization. One of the main challenges in this process is the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the high intrinsic entropy of polymer chains, which makes their adsorption on catalysts unfavorable and the transition state unstable. Here, we overcome this challenge by inducing the catalytic reaction inside mesoporous channels, which possess a strong confined ability to polymer chains, allowing for stabilization of the transition state. This approach involves the synthesis of p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalysts, in which Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the channels of an SBA&#8208;15 support, using a precise impregnation method. The unique design of the p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalyst has demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic performance for the conversion of polyethylene into high&#8208;value liquid fuels, particularly diesel. The catalyst achieved a high solid conversion rate of 1106&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 230&#8201;&#176;C. Comparatively, this catalytic activity is 4.9&#8197;times higher than that of a control catalyst, Ru/SiO2, and 14.0&#8197;times higher than that of a commercial catalyst, Ru/C, at 240&#8201;&#176;C. This remarkable catalytic activity opens up immense opportunities for the chemical upcycling of waste plastics.

Here we have developed Lateral Flow Assays that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. With these analytical platforms we have demonstrated the rapid, sensitive and quantitative detection of several targets including small molecules, antibodies and proteins.







Abstract
Here we develop Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. We have rationally re&#8208;engineered tile&#8208;based DNA tubular structures that can act as scaffolds and can be decorated with recognition elements of different nature (i.e. antigens, aptamers or proteins) and with orthogonal fluorescent dyes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we have developed sandwich and competitive multiplex lateral flow platforms for the detection of several targets, ranging from small molecules (digoxigenin, Dig and dinitrophenol, DNP), to antibodies (Anti&#8208;Dig, Anti&#8208;DNP and Anti&#8208;MUC1/EGFR bispecific antibodies) and proteins (thrombin). Coupling the advantages of functional DNA&#8208;based scaffolds together with the simplicity of LFAs, our approach offers the opportunity to detect a wide range of targets with nanomolar sensitivity and high specificity.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Antibiotic Resistance Genes through 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d Gradient Orbital Coupling Mediated Fenton&#8208;Like Redox Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective gradient 4f&#8211;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to rapidly generate more radical and nonradical (&#8901;OH, SO4.&#8722;, and 1O2), and enabling excellent degradation activity of antibiotic resistance genes.







Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8722;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce&#8197;4f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Co&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15&#8197;minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k=1.24&#8197;min&#8722;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co&#8197;3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4&#8201;%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10&#8197;hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom was precisely synthesized and exhibited better catalytic performance for silane oxidation with H2O. DFT calculations revealed that different mechanisms were observed for DACs and SACs where H2O was dissociated into H* and OH* species by the CuCo&#8208;DAC while the H2O acted as a nucleophile by Cu/Co&#8208;SAC.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DAC), which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;SAC) and Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;SAC). Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic assemblies based on pillararene&#8208;strutted covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles). The pillararenes in the assemblies play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, thus providing valuable insights into the construction of multifunctional porous materials with innovative and designable functions.







Abstract
Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) through competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems can be isolated in yields ranging from 70&#8201;% to 93&#8201;% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines underwent stereochemical editing at position C6 leading to the formation of products with a defined configuration which was retained in consecutive reactions. Spectroscopic evidence was collected corroborating a hydrogen atom transfer to the photocatalyst as the pivotal step of the process.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74&#8201;% to quantitative yield, 71&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.

A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5-diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst allows efficient total water splitting without scavengers by concurrently enriching electron density at the point&#8208;of&#8208;use for enhanced catalysis and delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF for oxygen evolution. Notably, our multifunctional interface boosts hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold when compared to emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers.







Abstract
The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation of the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO with the Faradaic efficiencies for C2+ products was established through combined reactivity and spectroscopic investigations. The CO binding energy is a relevant but incomplete descriptor for the selectivity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2RR. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (CuCO2) and the further reduction of CO (CuCO) is identified as another key descriptor.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies (
) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of 
 with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on 
 is observed on OD&#8722;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor.

         <title>Super&#8208;Oxidizing Covalent Triazine Framework Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a class of extended porous organic network with tunable redox properties. A CTF with high oxidizing property is reported here that can selectively generate hydrogen peroxide by stepwise oxidation of water, detailing the mechanism both experimentally and theoretically. This is the first example of a beyond&#8208;carbon metal&#8208;free catalyst showing better performance than most contemporary electrode materials.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428&#8197;&#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0&#8197;V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes using a palladium/copper/lithium ternary system was developed for the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This ternary system afforded the allylic and benzylic substituted fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities in a stereodivergent manner (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr)







Abstract
Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8722;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8722;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline polymers. Herein we report the room temperature and scalable synthesis of two isostructural COFs, modulated by the introduction of fluorine atoms, obtaining an extended framework with record number of F per pore. The substitution produces a dramatical increase of selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis, with a response comparable to other noble electrocatalysts.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062&#8197;V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757&#8197;s&#8722;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.

The unprecedented covalent three dimensionally patterned graphene heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made organophenyl bridging layer, and three metal oxide films (ZnO, Al2O3, and CuO) were constructed. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured nano&#8208;ensembles are generated via a 2D&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive. Here, we report the first realization of unprecedented 3D&#8208;patterned graphene nano&#8208;ensembles composed of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made structured organophenyl layer, and three metal oxide films, providing the first example of such a hybrid nano&#8208;architecture. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured quinary hybrids are generated via a two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process, involving an initial lateral molecular programming of the graphene lattice via lithography&#8208;assisted 2D functionalization and a subsequent stepwise molecular assembly in these regions in the z&#8208;direction. Our breakthrough lays the foundation for the construction of emerging 3D&#8208;patterned graphene heterostructures.

         <title>Stability and Crystallinity of Sodium Poly(Heptazine Imide) in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with high crystallinity were synthesized, by enhancing contact of melamine and NaCl via dissolution&#8208;evaporation and ball&#8208;milling joint treatment, and exhibit high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from water splitting, but, unconventionally, remarkable photochemical instability owing to gradual Na+ loss, which, interestingly, can be retarded by the common ion effect.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420&#8197;nm reaching 41.5&#8201;%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.

Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox ligand enabled the construction of diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition&#8208;metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram&#8208;scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.

&lt;p&gt;Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate-dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electron of the transition-metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5-H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram-scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu-catalyzed remote substitution process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Cover: 2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic molecules &#160;are constructed by hydrogen bond interaction between a donor&#8211;acceptor pair of polymer&#8208;grafted gold nanoparticles. As demonstrated in the Research Article (e202309798) by Yingying Cai and Philipp Vana, the weak yet multidentate hydrogen bonding allows a structural rearrangement from 3D to 2D when cast onto a substrate. Precise control of the coordination number is enabled by fine&#8208;tuning the interparticle interaction.

         <dc:description>
A library of synthetic full&#8208;length Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared to investigate the impact of Ser phosphorylation, as reported by Ariel Afek, Muhammad Jbara et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310913). Comprehensive DNA binding analysis and high&#8208;throughput screening revealed that the phosphorylation pattern plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but does not affect sequence specificity. The insights gained into the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation shed light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.

Anti&#8208;Stokes fluorescence lifetime imaging in living cells was demonstrated by Rachel C. Evans et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202308602). This was achieved through the design of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle probes based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells suggest that the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309694). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable the further design of systems in which large and complex molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing organic materials can absorb externally provided nutrient compounds to modify their sizes, shapes, structures, and properties. This Minireview describes the concept of these materials and their recent progress, including the self&#8208;growing strategies, mass transport mechanisms in growth, simulation models, and potential applications. It provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of this emerging new field.







Abstract
The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms can continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this Minireview, we summarize these materials in terms of six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are grouped into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms. We then explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical for controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterwards, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various applications, including tuning bulk properties, creating textured surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, and others. These examples are then summed up. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts, a judicious combination of ion&#8208;pair elements with peptide scaffolds that bear multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors, have captivated considerable attention for their unprecedented performance in a plethora of enantioselective transformations, in many cases enabling never&#8208;before&#8208;seen patterns of reactivity and selectivity. In this context, we provide a succinct overview of recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[n]arenes are unique cylindrical macrocycles in which the planar chirality of their &#960;&#8208;units can be inverted through unit flipping but prefers to be aligned. This Minireview describes how these features have led to the development of chiroptical molecules, dynamic chirality alignment phenomena in tubular assemblies of pillar[n]arenes, and environment&#8208;responsive chiral outputs in diastereomeric systems with additional chiral sources.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can we realize thermodynamically unfavored chemical processes? The operating principles of molecular machines&#8212;ratchet mechanisms&#8212;can help answer this. This tutorial Review provides an overview that balances experimental examples with rationalizations, while detaching from directional motion. A unifying picture is offered for chemical&#8208;, light&#8208;, and redox&#8208;driven systems, highlighting connections with active transport and bioenergetics, among others.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type&#8212;rather than the application domain or energy source&#8212;we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.

         <title>Constructing Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>

The solid electrolyte interphase plays an important role for the stability of zinc anodes. This Review summarizes the construction methods, formation mechanisms, composition and electrochemical performance of SEIs, thus providing guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.







Abstract
Problems of zinc anode including dendrite and hydrogen evolution seriously degrade the performance of zinc batteries. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which plays a key role in achieving high reversibility of lithium anode in aprotic organic solvent, is also beneficial to performance improvement of zinc anode in aqueous electrolyte. However, various studies about interphase for zinc electrode is quite fragmented, and lack of deep understanding on root causes or general design rules for SEI construction. And water molecules with high reactivity brings serious challenge to the effective SEI construction. Here, we reviewed the brief development history of zinc batteries firstly, then summarized the approaches to construct SEI in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms behind approaches are systematically analyzed, together with discussion on the SEI components and evaluation on electrochemical performance of zinc anode with various types of SEI. Meanwhile, the challenge between lab and industrialization are also discussed.

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening

Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;harvesting ability of a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) has been used to amplify the emission of an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye through an electron&#8208;exchange&#8208;based energy transfer to afford a fluorescence sensor that can detect aqueous per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at &#956;g/L levels. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS diminishes the efficiency of the energy transfer and leads to a ratiometric fluorescence response.







Abstract
The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron&#8208;exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.

         <title>Controlling the Assembly of Cellulose&#8208;Based Oligosaccharides through Sequence Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides were designed to generate carbohydrate assemblies with tunable shapes and properties. Rod&#8208; or square&#8208;like crystalline materials as well as supramolecular hydrogels were obtained following systematic modifications of the glycan primary sequences. Synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based materials could offer new tools to material scientists and supramolecular chemists.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace water monitoring in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed. A charge labelled electrophile functions as a mass tag to specifically capture water from the mixture. Dynamic monitoring of water content in levitated droplets and in chemical reaction mixtures facilitates mechanistic investigations of processes involving water.







Abstract
This study uses a rapid tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace&#8208;water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge&#8208;labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass&#8208;measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.

         <title>Stabilization Of The CN35&#8722; Anion In Recoverable High&#8208;pressure Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) Oxoguanidinates</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of recoverable Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The first stabilization of CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine&#8212;was achieved.







Abstract
A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8722; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony guanidinate SbCN3 was produced in a high&#8208;pressure&#8208;high&#8208;temperature synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The compound can be produced from elements as well as via a reaction between antimony and cyanuric triazide. This study demonstrates a straightforward route to novel nitridocarbonates. SbCN3 is a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg=2.20&#8197;eV as shown by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8722; and NCN2&#8722; carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8211;38&#8197;GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8722;, marking a fundamental milestone in carbonitride chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value of 2.20&#8197;eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene of thienothiophene core fused with two hexabenzocoronene units exhibits excellent performance as an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. The isomer (PP and MM) with more interlayer distance exhibited a high lithium storage capability compared to the other isomer and racemic mixture. Helical nanographene anodes display excellent rate capability, superior long&#8208;term cycling performance, and recyclability.







Abstract
Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000&#8197;cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500&#8197;cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of dienes and enynes is reported. This mild protocol harnesses visible light to enhance the hydricity of PdH species, enabling a chemoselectivity switch of the hydropalladation step. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.

This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron-rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH-catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro-fused tricyclic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six&#8208;electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three&#8208;phase conversion (TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton&#8208;dependent reaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.







Abstract
The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy change), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex situ and in situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the weakly acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first parent metallocene dication is reported. Nickelocene was twice deelectronated, i.e. single&#8208;electron oxidized, by [NO]+ in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The [NiCp2]+ and [NiCp2]2+ cations were isolated as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salts and were fully characterized by NMR, CV and XRD analysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8901;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (Cp = C5H5; RF=C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave quasi reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8594;1) and +1.17&#8197;V (1&#8594;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8197;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6&#8197;ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8901;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Chelating Aziridines and Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) from Pyridyl&#8208;Tethered Robust Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80&#8201;&#176;C but unprecedentedly result N&#8722;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC=cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60&#8201;&#176;C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cationic boron&#8208;containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring&#8208;contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring&#8208;expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B2N3C pentafulvene derivative.







Abstract
N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8722;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property.

     alt="Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cationic boron-containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring-contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring-expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C pentafulvene derivative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Ring contraction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with an N-heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as 1,4-hydrogen shift affords a carbene-stabilized azadiboriridine &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. Abstraction of the &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;B&lt;sub&gt;3mem&lt;/sub&gt; hydride in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X-ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N three-membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, the latter of which possesses a cationic B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with a diazo compound produces a cationic B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C pentafulvene derivative &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bayesian optimization has been successfully employed to accelerate discovery of the high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres for catalytic CH4 combustion. The target T50 could reach a minimum after only two iterations, and the workload can be greatly reduced from thousands to as few as 18&#8197;experiments.







Abstract
Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio (the Pt/Pd mole ratio ranges from 1/2.33&#8211;1/9.09, and Ce/Zr from 1/0.22&#8211;1/0.35), which directly results in a lower conversion temperature (T50 approaching to 330&#8201;&#176;C) than ones reported hitherto. Consequently, the best sample obtained could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18&#8197;experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems, for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8722;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reaction of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines was developed, which allows to achieve a kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines representing a straightforward route to construct C&#8722;B axial chirality. Two kinds of C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines are then readily diversified into a range of chiral intermediates, as well as transformed into potential chiral ligand.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules, scale&#8208;up reaction, and applications.

The fast H3O+ insertion/extraction reaction of the diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF hydronium&#8208;ion battery with superior performances.







Abstract
Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), attractive energy density (182.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (31.2&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Zheng Lab (UHN, Toronto, Canada), the CEPOF BioPhotonics Lab (USP, S&#227;o Carlos, Brazil), and the BiOPI Lab (UC Chile, Santiago, Chile). They recently published an article on an Indocyanine Green (ICG) nanoemulsion in which 100&#8201;% dimerization and J&#8208;aggregation occurs spontaneously afford a nanostructured shell of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG). This material demonstrates superior photothermal conversion efficiency, photostability, and structure stability over ICG, giving an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform for photoacoustic imaging and effective photothermal therapy. &#8220;Nanostructure&#8208;Driven Indocyanine Green Dimerization Generates Ultra&#8208;Stable Phototheranostics Nanoparticles&#8221;, N.

         <title>Reconstitution of the Final Steps in the Biosynthesis of Valanimycin Reveals the Origin of Its Characteristic Azoxy Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Valanimycin is an azoxy&#8208;containing natural product isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456&#8208;hF10. While the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been partially characterized, how the azoxy group is constructed remains obscure. Herein, the membrane protein VlmO and the putative hydrazine synthetase ForJ from the formycin biosynthetic pathway are demonstrated to catalyze N&#8722;N bond formation converting O&#8208;(l&#8208;seryl)&#8208;isobutyl hydroxylamine to N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;l&#8208;serine. Subsequent installation of the azoxy group is shown to be catalyzed by the non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme VlmB in a reaction where the N&#8722;N single bond in the VlmO/ForJ product is oxidized by four electrons to yield the azoxy group. The catalytic cycle of VlmB appears to begin with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex in VlmB, which is supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. This work also identifies N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;d&#8208;serine as an alternative substrate for VlmB leading to two azoxy regioisomers. The reactions catalyzed by the kinase VlmJ and the lyase VlmK during the final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis are established as well. The biosynthesis of valanimycin is thus fully reconstituted in vitro using the enzymes VlmO/ForJ, VlmB, VlmJ and VlmK. Importantly, the VlmB catalyzed reaction represents the first example of enzyme catalyzed azoxy formation and is expected to proceed via an atypical mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanocores Initiated Construction of Smart DNA&#8208;Polymer Microgels with Programmable and Regulable Functions and Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Locomotion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their sequence&#8208;directed functions and excellent biocompatibility,&#160;smart DNA microgels have attracted considerable research interest, and the combination of DNA microgels with functional nanostructures can further expand their applications in biosensing and biomedicine. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) exhibiting both fluidic and metallic properties hold great promise for the development of smart soft materials; in particular, LM particles upon sonication can mediate radical&#8208;initiated polymerization reactions, thus allowing the combination of LMs and polymeric matrix to construct &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; materials. Herein, by forming active surfaces under sonication, LM nanoparticles (LM NPs) initiated localized radical polymerization reactions allow the combination of functional DNA units and different polymeric backbones to yield multifunctional core/shell microgels. The localized polymerization reaction allows fine control of the microgel compositions, and smart DNA microgels with tunable catalytic activities can be constructed. Moreover, due to the excellent photothermal effect of LM NPs, the resulting temperature gradient between microgels and surrounding solution upon NIR light irradiation can drive the oriented locomotion of the microgels, and remote control of the activity of these smart microgels can be achieved. These microgels may hold promise for various applications, such as the development of in vivo and in vitro biosensing and drug delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Polyarenes by Catalytic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient synthetic method, involving a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling, for polycyclic aromatic compounds containing seven&#8208;membered rings. A variety of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons were synthesized. In addition, a one&#8208;pot synthetic method comprising Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization was developed. Furthermore, it was possible to construct two seven&#8208;membered rings simultaneously.







Abstract
Nanocarbons incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal aromatic rings &#8208; such as five&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings &#8208; have various intriguing physical properties such as curved structures, unique one&#8208;dimensional packing, and promising magnetic, optical, and conductivity properties. Herein, we report an efficient synthetic approach to polycyclic aromatics containing seven&#8208;membered rings via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Ar&#8722;H/Ar&#8722;Br coupling. In addition to all&#8208;hydrocarbon scaffolds, heteroatom&#8208;embedded heptagon&#8208;containing polyarenes can be efficiently constructed with this method. Rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered ring formations also afford complex heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons from readily available arylacetylenes and biphenyl boronic acids. Detailed mechanistic analysis by DFT calculations showed the feasibility of seven&#8208;membered ring formation by a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism. This reaction can serve as a template for the synthesis of a wide range of seven&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons.

         <title>A Homochiral Fulgide Organic Ferroelectric Crystal with Photoinduced Molecular Orbital Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral organic fulgide ferroelectric crystal was synthesized that showed a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals between its open&#8208;ring and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior is significantly distinct from the thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics and enables reversible switching of ferroelectric domains by optical manipulation.







Abstract
Thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics has been extensively studied for manipulation of the ferroelectricity. However, photoinduced molecular orbital breaking, which is promising for optical control of ferroelectric polarization, has been rarely explored. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized a homochiral fulgide organic ferroelectric crystal (E)&#8208;(R)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylidene&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylmethylene)dihydro&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (1), which exhibits both ferroelectricity and photoisomerization. Significantly, 1 shows a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals from the 3&#8197;&#960; molecular orbitals in the open&#8208;ring isomer to 2&#8197;&#960; and 1&#8197;&#963; molecular orbitals in the closed&#8208;ring isomer, which enables reversible ferroelectric domain switching by optical manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization in homochiral ferroelectric crystal by photoinduced breaking of molecular orbitals.

     alt="A Homochiral Fulgide Organic Ferroelectric Crystal with Photoinduced Molecular Orbital Breaking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A homochiral organic fulgide ferroelectric crystal was synthesized that showed a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals between its open-ring and closed-ring isomers. This behavior is significantly distinct from the thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics and enables reversible switching of ferroelectric domains by optical manipulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics has been extensively studied for manipulation of the ferroelectricity. However, photoinduced molecular orbital breaking, which is promising for optical control of ferroelectric polarization, has been rarely explored. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized a homochiral fulgide organic ferroelectric crystal (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-3-methyl-3-cyclohexylidene-4-(diphenylmethylene)dihydro-2,5-furandione (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibits both ferroelectricity and photoisomerization. Significantly, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals from the 3&#8197;&#960; molecular orbitals in the open-ring isomer to 2&#8197;&#960; and 1&#8197;&#963; molecular orbitals in the closed-ring isomer, which enables reversible ferroelectric domain switching by optical manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization in homochiral ferroelectric crystal by photoinduced breaking of molecular orbitals. This finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics for optical manipulation of ferroelectricity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Rotors: Fluorescent Sensors for Microviscosity and Conformation of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we describe recent advances in the development of fluorescence&#8208;based viscosity sensors, termed Molecular Rotors, and discuss how these dyes can be exploited to quantify the microviscosity of biological environment, probe lipid membranes and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures and track dynamic processes, including protein aggregation.







Abstract
The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptides ADP&#8208;Ribosylated at Histidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the preparation of ribofuranosylated Fmoc&#8208;histidine building blocks via a Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation. These building blocks were used in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, followed by on&#8208;resin pyrophosphate construction and deprotection to access peptides containing N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine. The N&#8208;glycosidic linkage proved stable to the treatment with aqueous acid and base and resistant to (ADP&#8208;ribosyl)hydrolases.







Abstract
The transfer of an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose moiety to a nucleophilic side chain by consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is referred to as ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which allows for the spatiotemporal regulation of vital processes such as apoptosis and DNA repair. Recent mass&#8208;spectrometry based analyses of the &#8220;ADP&#8208;ribosylome&#8221; have identified histidine as ADP&#8208;ribose acceptor site. In order to study this modification, a fully synthetic strategy towards &#945;&#8208;configured N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed. Ribofuranosylated histidine building blocks were obtained via Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation and the building blocks were integrated into an ADP&#8208;ribosylome derived peptide sequence using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. On&#8208;resin installation of the ADP moiety was achieved using phosphoramidite chemistry, and global deprotection provided the desired ADP&#8208;ribosylated oligopeptides. The stability under various chemical conditions and resistance against (ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase&#8208;mediated degradation has been investigated to reveal that the constructs are stable under various chemical conditions and non&#8208;degradable by any of the known ADP&#8208;ribosylhydrolases.

         <dc:description>
Strategies to prepare 2&#8208;azanorbornanes by photochemical strain&#8208;release formal cycloadditions is presented. The method involves the combination of azahousanes or housanes with alkenes or imines, respectively. The 2&#8208;azanorbornanes have defined exit vectors and represent new building blocks to enable drug development. The synthetic utilty of the products is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Rigid bicycles are becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical industry because they allow for expansion to new and unique chemical spaces. This work describes a new strategy to construct 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, which can act as rigid piperidine/pyrrolidine scaffolds with well&#8208;defined exit vectors. To achieve the synthesis of 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, new strain&#8208;release reagent, azahousane, is introduced along with its photosensitized strain&#8208;release formal cycloaddition with alkenes. Furthermore, new reactivity between a housane and an imine is disclosed. Both strategies lead to various substituted 2&#8208;azanorbornanes with good selectivities.

         <title>Clean Synthetic Strategies to Biologically Active Molecules from Lignin: A Green Path to Drug Discovery
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable strategies inspired by the innate structural features of lignin were developed for the synthesis of diverse biologically active compounds, including tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, dopamine and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. The synthetic approach enabled the rapid assessment of relevant biological activities through in vitro and in vivo studies and computational similarity searches, with multiple promising hits identified.







Abstract
Deriving active pharmaceutical agents from renewable resources is crucial to increasing the economic feasibility of modern biorefineries and promises to alleviate critical supply&#8208;chain dependencies in pharma manufacturing. Our multidisciplinary approach combines research in lignin&#8208;first biorefining, sustainable catalysis, and alternative solvents with bioactivity screening, an in vivo efficacy study, and a structural&#8208;similarity search. The resulting sustainable path to novel anti&#8208;infective, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anticancer molecules enabled the rapid identification of frontrunners for key therapeutic indications, including an anti&#8208;infective against the priority pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae with efficacy in vivo and promising plasma and metabolic stability. Our catalytic methods provided straightforward access, inspired by the innate structural features of lignin, to synthetically challenging biologically active molecules with the core structure of dopamine, namely, tetrahydroisoquinolines, quinazolinones, 3&#8208;arylindoles and the natural product tetrahydropapaveroline. Our diverse array of atom&#8208;economic transformations produces only harmless side products and uses benign reaction media, such as tunable deep eutectic solvents for modulating reactivity in challenging cyclization steps.

         <title>Surface Termination on Unstable Methylammonium&#8208;based Perovskite Using a Steric Barrier for Improved Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface termination can passivate perovskite films and avoid the degradation of low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterojunctions, but it's difficult to realize surface termination to hybrid perovskites due to the fast cation exchange. Here, a benzyltrimethylammonium cation with rational designed steric barrier can effectively surface terminate methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with a wide processing window and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Compared to widely adopted low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterostructure, functional organic cation based surface termination on perovskite can not only realize advantage of defect passivation but also prevent potential disadvantage of the heterostructure induced intercalation into 3D perovskite. However, it is still very challenging to controllably construct surface termination on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite because the functional organic cations&#8217; substitution reaction is easy to form LD/3D heterostructure. Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5&#8208;dimensional perovskite of BTA4Pb3I10 by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10&#8197;minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI3 films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 shows better passivation effect than BTA4Pb3I10&#8208;MAPbI3 heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (11.52&#8197;cm2) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI3 based ones.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to widely adopted low-dimensional/three-dimensional (LD/3D) heterostructure, functional organic cation based surface termination on perovskite can not only realize advantage of defect passivation but also prevent potential disadvantage of the heterostructure induced intercalation into 3D perovskite. However, it is still very challenging to controllably construct surface termination on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite because the functional organic cations&#8217; substitution reaction is easy to form LD/3D heterostructure. Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5-dimensional perovskite of BTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10&#8197;minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI-MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows better passivation effect than BTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and mini-module (11.52&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;Based Gene Editing System for Efficient Gene Therapy in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely developed as the smart drug delivery systems. Herein, a DNA origami with precisely organized PAM&#8208;rich region on its surface has been constructed to efficiently recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization for targeted gene editing of tumor&#8208;associated gene. This DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system has achieved a pronounced gene therapy in vivo.







Abstract
DNA nanostructures have played an important role in the development of novel drug delivery systems. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for efficient gene therapy in vivo. In our design, a PAM&#8208;rich region precisely organized on the surface of DNA origami can easily recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization. After loading the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, the DNA origami can be further rolled up by the locking strands with a disulfide bond. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, the cargo&#8208;loaded DNA origami can realize the targeted delivery and effective endosomal escape. After reduction by GSH, the opened DNA origami can release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex by RNase H cleavage to achieve a pronounced gene editing of a tumor&#8208;associated gene for gene therapy in vivo. This rationally developed DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system presents a new avenue for the development of gene therapy.

         <title>A Mechanistic Understanding of the Distinct Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity of Multifunctional P450s by Structural Comparison of IkaD and CftA Complexed with Common Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structures of the homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA complexed with the natural substrate ikarugamycin reveal that their regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity are controlled by the distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA, which differentiate the substrate orientation and cause distinct binding patterns with the polar moieties of substrates. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket of IkaD can alter the regioselectivity.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and chemoselective C&#8722;H activation at multi&#8208;positions of a single molecule is fascinating but chemically challenging. The homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA catalyze multiple C&#8722;H oxidations on the same polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PoTeM) ikarugamycin, with distinct regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Herein we provide mechanistic understanding of their functional differences by solving crystal structures of IkaD and CftA in complex with ikarugamycin and unnatural substrates. Distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA are found to differentiate the orientation of PoTeM substrates, by causing different binding patterns with polar moieties to determine site selection, oxidation order, and chemoselectivity. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket altered the regioselectivity of IkaD, indicating that substrate re&#8208;orientation by mutating residues distal to the oxidation site could serve as an important method in future engineering of P450 enzymes.

         <title>Aluminum(III) Cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArMes2]+: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in FLP&#8208;Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Rare examples of three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations of the form [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and their etherate analogues [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;are presented. The Lewis&#8208;acidity of the cations was evaluated theoretically and experimentally to be very high. These cationic Lewis&#8208;acids form a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP) upon addition of the phosphine PCy3, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.







Abstract
The three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations ligated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (NHC=IMeMe 4, IiPrMe 5, IiPr 6, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) were prepared via hydride abstraction of the alanes (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe 1, IiPrMe 2, IiPr 3) using [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; in toluene as hydride acceptor. If this reaction was performed in diethyl ether, the corresponding four&#8208;coordinate aluminum etherate cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+ [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 7&#8211;9 (NHC=IMeMe 7, IiPrMe 8, IiPr 9) were isolated. According to a theoretical and experimental assessment of the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+ cation is the acidity larger than that of B(C6F5)3 and of similar magnitude as reported for Al(C6F5)3. The reaction of [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 4 with the sterically less demanding, basic phosphine PMe3 afforded a mixed NHC/phosphine stabilized cation [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(PMe3)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 10. Equimolar mixtures of 4 and the sterically more demanding PCy3 gave a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP), i.e., [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;/PCy3 FLP&#8208;11, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Arrhenius Na&#8208;ion Conductivity in Na3OBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poorly crystalline impurities consisting of Na2O, Na2O2, and NaOH were detected in Na3OBr antiperovskite synthesised with commercially available Na2O. These impurities form a eutectic mixture which melts at around 250&#8201;&#176;C, reducing the activation energy for Na+ conduction from 0.47&#8197;eV to 0.43&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The sodium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (NaRAPs) with composition Na3OB (B=Br, Cl, I, BH4, etc.) are a family of materials that has recently attracted great interest for application as solid electrolytes in sodium metal batteries. Non&#8208;Arrhenius ionic conductivities have been reported for these materials, the origin of which is poorly understood. In this work, we combined temperature&#8208;resolved bulk and local characterisation methods to gain an insight into the origin of this unusual behaviour using Na3OBr as a model system. We first excluded crystallographic disorder on the anion sites as the cause of the change in activation energy; then identified the presence of a poorly crystalline impurities, not detectable by XRD, and elucidated their effect on ionic conductivity. These findings improve understanding of the processing&#8208;structure&#8208;properties relationships pertaining to NaRAPs and highlight the need to determine these relationships in other materials systems, which will accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes.

         <title>1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptane as a Bioisostere of Piperidine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine ring resulted in a patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.







Abstract
1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. The key synthesis step was thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between endocyclic alkenes and the Graf isocyanate, ClO2S&#8722;NCO, to give spirocyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. Reduction of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring with alane produced 1&#8208;azaspiro[3.3]heptanes. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine fragment resulted in a new patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.

         <title>Non&#8208;native Intramolecular Radical Cyclization Catalyzed by a B12&#8208;Dependent Enzyme
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B12&#8208;dependent enzyme, CarH*, was engineered that can efficiently catalyze the radical cyclization of halide substrates containing a pendant olefin or alkyne, enabling the synthesis of a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated lactams. Additionally, CarH* displayed an intriguing ability to mediate reductive dearomative spirocyclization of substrates with aromatic acceptors to generate spirobicycles, featuring uncommon 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene selectivity.







Abstract
Despite the unique reactivity of vitamin B12 and its derivatives, B12&#8208;dependent enzymes remain underutilized in biocatalysis. In this study, we repurposed the B12&#8208;dependent transcription factor CarH to enable non&#8208;native radical cyclization reactions. An engineered variant of this enzyme, CarH*, catalyzes the formation &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams through either redox&#8208;neutral or reductive ring closure with marked enhancement of reactivity and selectivity relative to the free B12 cofactor. CarH* also catalyzes an unusual spirocyclization by dearomatization of pendant arenes to produce bicyclic 1,3&#8208;diene products instead of 1,4&#8208;dienes provided by existing methods. These results and associated mechanistic studies highlight the importance of protein scaffolds for controlling the reactivity of B12 and expanding the synthetic utility of B12&#8208;dependent enzymes.

         <title>Chemical Proteomic Discovery of Isotype&#8208;Selective Covalent Inhibitors of the RNA Methyltransferase NSUN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based protein profiling identifies azetidine acrylamides that covalently inhibit the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 through targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine. The azetidine acrylamides show high isotype selectivity and perturb NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions and the 5&#8208;methylcytosine (m5C) content of RNA in cancer cells.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine (m5C) is an RNA modification prevalent on tRNAs, where it can protect tRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage to maintain protein synthesis. The NSUN family (NSUN1&#8208;7 in humans) of RNA methyltransferases are capable of installing the methyl group onto the C5 position of cytosines in RNA. NSUNs are implicated in a wide range of (patho)physiological processes, but selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of these enzymes are lacking. Here, we use cysteine&#8208;directed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) to discover azetidine acrylamides that act as stereoselective covalent inhibitors of human NSUN2. Despite targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine in the NSUN family, the NSUN2 inhibitors show negligible cross&#8208;reactivity with other human NSUNs and exhibit good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. We verify that the azetidine acrylamides inhibit the catalytic activity of recombinant NSUN2, but not NSUN6, and demonstrate that these compounds stereoselectively disrupt NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions in cancer cells, leading to a global reduction in tRNA m5C content. Our findings thus highlight the potential to create isotype&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of NSUN2 with covalent chemistry targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Assembly of DNA Origami into Dissipative Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We build hierarchical DNA origami fibrils using protonated DNA strands. By employing a small molecule that releases protons during irradiation, our system is activated by light and is assembled under dissipative conditions. Generating no waste, our fibrils can be built and demolished multiple times, underscoring the utility of pH&#8208;responsive, non&#8208;canonical DNA motifs for out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assembly.







Abstract
Hierarchical DNA nanostructures offer programmable functions at scale, but making these structures dynamic, while keeping individual components intact, is challenging. Here we show that the DNA A&#8208;motif&#8212;protonated, self&#8208;complementary poly(adenine) sequences&#8212;can propagate DNA origami into one&#8208;dimensional, micron&#8208;length fibrils. When coupled to a small molecule pH regulator, visible light can activate the hierarchical assembly of our DNA origami into dissipative fibrils. This system is recyclable and does not require DNA modification. By employing a modular and waste&#8208;free strategy to assemble and disassemble hierarchical structures built from DNA origami, we offer a facile and accessible route to developing well&#8208;defined, dynamic, and large DNA assemblies with temporal control. As a general tool, we envision that coupling the A&#8208;motif to cycles of dissipative protonation will allow the transient construction of diverse DNA nanostructures, finding broad applications in dynamic and non&#8208;equilibrium nanotechnology.

A strategy of tailoring dynamic covalent bonds with a low rotational energy barrier was proposed to fabricate phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinked recyclable thermosets and their composites, simultaneously overcoming the trade&#8208;off between recycling efficiency and comprehensive properties in current covalent adaptable materials and offering a guidance for the rational design of sustainable thermosetting polymers for versatile applications.







Abstract
Although a variety of dynamic covalent bonds have been successfully used in the development of diverse sustainable thermosetting polymers and their composites, solving the trade&#8208;off between recovery efficiency and comprehensive properties is still a major challenge. Herein, a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy of lower rotational energy barrier (Er) phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloadditions was proposed for easily recyclable carbon fiber (CF)&#8208;reinforced epoxy resins (EPs) composites. In such a strategy, the phosphate spacer with lower Er accelerated the segmental mobility and dynamic DA exchange reaction for network rearrangement to achieve high&#8208;efficiency repairing, reprocessing of the EPs matrix and its composites and rapid nondestructive recycling of CF; meanwhile, incorporating phosphorus&#8208;based units especially reduced their fire hazards. The resulting materials simultaneously showed excellent thermal/mechanical properties, superb fire safety and facile recyclability, realizing the concept of recycling for high&#8208;performance thermosetting polymers and composites. This strategy is of great significance for understanding and enriching the molecular connotation of DA chemistry, making it potentially applicable to the design and development of a wide range of dynamic covalent adaptable materials toward practical cutting&#8208;edge&#8208;tech applications.

         <title>A Colorimetric Biosensing Platform with Aptamers, Rolling Circle Amplification and Urease&#8208;Mediated Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensitive and simple&#8208;to&#8208;use colorimetric sensors are highly desirable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic applications. Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification and the high efficiency of a urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. By using aptamers for target recognition, this platform can be adapted for a wide range of sensing applications.







Abstract
Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and the high efficiency of a simple urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. The presence of a target triggers the RCA reaction, and urease&#8208;labelled DNA can hybridize to the biotinylated RCA products and be immobilized onto streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads. The urease&#8208;laden beads are then used to hydrolyze urea, leading to an increase in pH that can be detected by a simple litmus test. We show this sensing platform can be easily integrated with aptamers for sensing diverse targets via the detection of human thrombin and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) utilizing structure&#8208;switching aptamers as well as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva using a spike&#8208;binding trimeric DNA aptamer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this colorimetric sensing platform can be integrated into a simple paper&#8208;based device for sensing applications.

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Block Copolymers: New Scission Site due to Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry can lead to the degradation of the properties of covalent macromolecules. In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size&#8208;exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non&#8208;random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end&#8208;to&#8208;end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain&#8208;centered.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A that exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Alkylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides with Conjugated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of unactivated alkyl chlorides under mild and sustainable conditions are rare compared to those of alkyl bromides or iodides. As a result, synthetic methods capable of modifying the vast chemical space of chloroalkane reagents, wastes, and materials are limited. We report the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive addition of unactivated alkyl chlorides to conjugated alkenes. Co&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkyl chlorides is performed under electroreductive conditions, and the resulting reactions constitute formal alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond formation. In addition to developing an operationally simple methodology, detailed mechanistic studies provide insights into the elementary steps of a proposed catalytic cycle. In particular, we propose a switch in the mechanism of C&#8208;Cl bond activation from nucleophilic substitution to halogen atom abstraction, which is critical for efficiently generating alkyl radicals. These mechanistic insights were leveraged in designing ligands that enable couplings of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Growth of Merocyanine Dye J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>J&#8208;aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip&#8208;stack packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one&#8208;dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co&#8208;facially stacked MCs with H&#8208;type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J&#8208;aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off&#8208;pathway nanoparticle showing H&#8208;type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J&#8208;type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self&#8208;assembly mechanism by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure. As an additional feature we demonstrate how the size of the nanosheets can be controlled by seeded living supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Direct Transfer of the (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)FeII(CN)(CO)2 Complex&#8208;B from HydG to HydE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen. Their prowess stems from the intricate H&#8208;cluster, combining a [Fe4S4] center with a binuclear iron center ([2Fe]H). In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand. The synthesis of this active site involves a unique multiprotein assembly, featuring radical SAM proteins HydG and HydE. HydG initiates the transformation of L&#8208;tyrosine into cyanide and carbon monoxide to generate complex&#8208;B, which is subsequently transferred to HydE to continue the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#8208;subcluster. Due to its instability, complex&#8208;B isolation for structural or spectroscopic characterization has been elusive this far. Nevertheless, the use of a biomimetic compound of complex&#8208;B allowed circumventing the need for the HydG protein during in vitro functional investigations, implying a similar structure for complex&#8208;B. Here, we used the HydE protein as a nanocage to encapsulate and stabilize the complex&#8208;B product generated by HydG. Using X&#8208;ray crystallography, we successfully determined its structure at 1.3 &#197; resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that complex&#8208;B is directly transferred from HydG to HydE, thus not being released into the solution post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting a transient interaction between the two proteins.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FeFe]-hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen. Their prowess stems from the intricate H-cluster, combining a [Fe4S4] center with a binuclear iron center ([2Fe]H). In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand. The synthesis of this active site involves a unique multiprotein assembly, featuring radical SAM proteins HydG and HydE. HydG initiates the transformation of L-tyrosine into cyanide and carbon monoxide to generate complex-B, which is subsequently transferred to HydE to continue the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H-subcluster. Due to its instability, complex-B isolation for structural or spectroscopic characterization has been elusive this far.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Polymerization Landscape by Lipid Mesophase Soft Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft nanoconfinement allows increasing chemical reactivity in nature and has therefore generated considerable interest in transferring this universal feature to artificial biological systems. Yet, little is known about the underlying principles of soft nanoconfinement responsible for the enhancement of biochemical reactions. Here we demonstrate how enzymatic polymerization can be expanded, optimized, and engineered when run under soft nanoconfinement mediated by lipidic mesophases. By systematically varying the water content in the mesophase and thus the diameter of the confined water nanochannels, we show higher efficiency, turnover rate, and polymerization degrees compared to the bulk aqueous solution, all controlled by soft nanoconfinement effects. Furthermore, we exploit the unique properties of unfreezing soft nanoconfined water to perform the first enzymatic polymerization at &#8722;&#65279;20 &#176;C in pure aqueous media. These results underpin lipidic mesophases as a versatile host system for chemical reactions and promote them as an original and unexplored platform for enzymatic polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism Elucidates Molecular Interactions in Aggregated Chiral Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral materials formed by aggregated organic compounds play a fundamental role in chiral optoelectronics, photo&#8208; and spin&#8208;tronics. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the molecular interactions involved remains an open problem. Here we introduce magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) as a new tool to elucidate molecular interactions and structural parameters of a supramolecular system. A detailed analysis of MCD together with electronic circular dichroism spectra combined to ab initio calculations unveils essential information on the geometry and energy levels of a self&#8208;assembled thin film made of a carbazole di&#8208;bithiophene chiral molecule. This approach can be extended to a generality of chiral organic materials and can help rationalizing the fundamental interactions leading to supramolecular order. This in turn could enable a better understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships, resulting in a more efficient material design.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Tetramers for Efficient Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been emerging as a new type of very promising microporous materials for gas separation and purification, but few HOFs structures constructed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers have been explored in this field. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46) afforded by hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers with 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamond networks, which shows excellent chemical and thermal stability. What's more, activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 exhibits the highest xenon (Xe) uptake of 2.51 mmol g&#8208;1 and xenon/krypton (Kr) selectivity of 19.9 at the ambient condition among the reported HOFs up to date. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirmed the excellent Xe/Kr separation of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a, showing high Kr productivity (110 mL g&#8208;1) and Xe uptake (1.29 mmol g&#8208;1), as well as good recyclability. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the molecular simulations revealed that the abundant accessible aromatic and pyrazole rings in the pore channels of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a can provide the multiple strong C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Xe interactions with Xe atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8211;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;member ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 1 0&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8208;6= selectivity up to 85% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88% in C2&#8208;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt; 4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt; 3) ratios. The high C3&#8208;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8208;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fast&#160;Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer&#160;Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy&#160;Strategy&#160;for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid,&#160;and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP&#160;and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8208;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt&#8217;s decomposition, enabling rapid Na+&#160;transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S cm&#8722;1) and tNa+&#160;(0.79) at 25 &#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability&#160;and stability (200 cycles, 99.2%, 0.5 C) with a good safety performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces are promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces are promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi-step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect-derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P-vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P-terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P-terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p-Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d-Rh2P). The P-vacancies enable the exposure of sub-surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P-sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d-Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p-Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d-Rh2P and p-Rh2P catalystic surfaces. As expected, the P-vacancy-enriched d-Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3 times mass activity that of p-Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Enantioselective and Helix&#8208;Sense Controlled Living Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of enantiomeric photoswitchable Pd(II) catalysts, alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LR&#8208;azo and alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LS&#8208;azo, were prepared via the coordination of alkyne&#8208;Pd(II) and azobenzene&#8208;modified phosphine ligands LR&#8208;azo and LS&#8208;azo. Owing to the cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LR&#8208;azo and alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LS&#8208;azo exhibited different polymerization activities, helix&#8208;sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different light wavelengths. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A&#8208;1 could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LR&#8208;azo under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right&#8208;handed helical poly&#8208;A&#8208;1m(LR&#8208;azo), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A&#8208;1 almost could not be initiated under 420 nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LR&#8208;azo exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1, respectively. D&#8208;1 was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D&#8208;1/L&#8208;1 rate ratio of 70, yielding single right&#8208;handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420 nm light using alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LR&#8208;azo, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L&#8208;1/D&#8208;1 was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne&#8208;Pd(II)/LS&#8208;azo showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH 4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH 10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcitation of Distinct Divalent Palladium Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Amination Under Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of metal complexes that function as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst remains a challenging research topic. So far, progress has been shown in Pd0 excited&#8208;state transition metal catalysis for the construction of C&#8211;C bonds where the oxidative addition of alkyl/aryl halides to zero&#8208;valent palladium (Pd0) is achievable at room temperature. In contrast, the analogous process with divalent palladium (PdII) is uphill and endothermic. For the first time, we report that divalent PdII can act as a light&#8208;absorbing species that undergoes double excitation to realize C&#8211;N cross&#8208;couplings under air atmosphere. Differently substituted aryl halides can be applied in the mild, and selective cross&#8208;coupling amination using Pd(OAc)2 as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst at room temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) studies supported by mechanistic investigations provide insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Discorhabdin V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discorhabdin natural products are a large subset of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids with a myriad of biological activities. Despite garnering much synthetic attention, few members have thus far been completed, particularly those featuring a bridging carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond that is found in numerous discorhabdins, including discorhabdin V. Here we report the first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V. To access the pyrroloiminoquinone we developed a convergent N&#8208;alkylation/oxidative aminocyclization/bromination cascade that joins two key components, which are both made on multigram scale. An intramolecular Heck reaction then forms the quaternary carbon center in an intermediate containing the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bridge, and a reductive N,O&#8208;acetal cyclization sequence introduces the final piperidine ring. Furthermore, we have established the relative stereochemistry of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V through experimental NOESY data and DP4 NMR probability calculations. The absolute configuration of the natural product has also been determined via circular dichroism and the use of an amino acid&#8208;derived chiral starting material. Our work represents one of only two reports of a total synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdin and paves the way for future biological evaluation of such compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single chiral emitter can induce the reversal of the cholesteric helix direction at a macroscopic level through a concentration&#8208;dependent effect at the molecular scale. This exceptional capacity endows the system with the extraordinary ability to seamlessly toggle the sign of circularly polarized luminescence, thus bestowing unparalleled mastery over the upconversion/downshift processes associated with the donor and acceptor moieties. &#8220;A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization (Duan and Zhao).&#8221;







Abstract
The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (R&#8208;PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of R&#8208;PCP from 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% to 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% inverted the helix of LCs from left&#8208;handed to right&#8208;handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral&#8208;chiral and chiral&#8208;achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion.

&lt;p&gt;A single chiral emitter can induce the reversal of the cholesteric helix direction at a macroscopic level through a concentration-dependent effect at the molecular scale. This exceptional capacity endows the system with the extraordinary ability to seamlessly toggle the sign of circularly polarized luminescence, thus bestowing unparalleled mastery over the upconversion/downshift processes associated with the donor and acceptor moieties. &#8220;A Single-Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization (Duan and Zhao).&#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-PCP from 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% to 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% inverted the helix of LCs from left-handed to right-handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral-chiral and chiral-achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion. Due to the strong helical twisting power, 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-PCP drove the photonic band gap (PBG) of chiral LCs to match up with their emission range, leading to an inversion of the CPL again with a high dissymmetry factor (&#8776;1.2). Directly adjusting the PBG using chiral emitters is seldom achieved in cholesteric LCs. On this basis, an achiral sensitizer PtTPBP was assembled into the helical superstructure. The generation of triplet-triplet annihilation-induced upconverted CPL from &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-PCP and the downshifting CPL from PtTPBP with opposite rotation was achieved in a single chiral LC system by tuning the position of the PBG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Significant Roles of Surface Hydrides in Enhancing the Performance of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrides into the lattice of BaTiO3 can notably enhance the methanol yield over a supported Cu catalyst in CO2 hydrogenation due to the direct participation of surface hydrides in the reaction and the modified electronic property of the interfacial sites in the Cu/ BaTiO2.8H0.2 catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the anionic site of catalyst supports can impact reaction pathways by creating active sites on the support or influencing metal&#8208;support interactions when using supported metal nanoparticles. This study focuses on CO2 hydrogenation over supported Cu nanoparticles, revealing a 3&#8208;fold increase in methanol yield when replacing oxygen anions with hydrides in the perovskite support (Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 yields ~146&#8197;mg/h/gCu vs. Cu/BaTiO3 yields ~50&#8197;mg/h/gCu). The contrast suggests that significant roles are played by the support hydrides in the reaction. Temperature programmed reaction and isotopic labelling studies indicate that BaTiO2.8H0.2 surface hydride species follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation, promoting methanol production. High&#8208;pressure steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) studies suggest that Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 possesses both a higher density and more active and selective sites for methanol production compared to Cu/BaTiO3. An operando high&#8208;pressure diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8208;SSITKA study shows that formate species are the major surface intermediates over both catalysts, and the subsequent hydrogenation steps of formate are likely rate&#8208;limiting. However, the catalytic reactivity of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 towards the formate species is much higher than Cu/BaTiO3, likely due to the altered electronic structure of interface Cu sites by the hydrides in the support as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Glutathione Mediates Control of Dual Differential Bio&#8208;orthogonal Labelling of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical modification at precise sites within biomolecules is essential to assist in understanding their function. The incorporation of bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups provides a strategy for selective tagging, however cross&#8208;reactivity is problematic when dual modification is required. Glutathione (GSH) is used to control the reactivity of ynamine and cyclooctyne reagents in sequential (3+2) cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Traditional approaches to bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction discovery have focused on developing reagent pairs that react with each other faster than they are metabolically degraded. Glutathione (GSH) is typically responsible for the deactivation of most bio&#8208;orthogonal reagents. Here we demonstrate that GSH promotes a Cu&#8208;catalysed (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between an ynamine and an azide. We show that GSH acts as a redox modulator to control the Cu oxidation state in these cycloadditions. Rate enhancement of this reaction is specific for ynamine substrates and is tuneable by the Cu:GSH ratio. This unique GSH&#8208;mediated reactivity gradient is then utilised in the dual sequential bio&#8208;orthogonal labelling of peptides and oligonucleotides via two distinct chemoselective (3+2) cycloadditions.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Arylations of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalytic system has been developed for selective (hetero)arylation, alkenylation and alkynylation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. The high functional group compatibility and application to the synthesis of cyclic peptides either by cyclization or stapling demonstrate the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Here we report a simple electrochemical route towards the synthesis of S&#8208;arylated peptides by a site selective coupling of peptides with aryl halides under base free conditions. This approach demonstrates the power of electrochemistry to access both highly complex peptide conjugates and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Parallel Planar Heterojunction Strategy Enables Sb2S3 Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 8&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy boosts the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;%, by integrating the distinctive structures of Sb2S3 layer and the duplexity of CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation. The PPHJ device consists of the conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low&#8208;cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32&#8201;% that is the highest amongst Sb2S3 devices. The Sb2S3&#8208;based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb2S3&#8208;based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH3NH3PbI3&#8208;based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb2S3 device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb2S3 absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well&#8208;crystallized/oriented CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the facile preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging the Sample Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93 &#177; 0.17 nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both electron beam (e&#8208;beam) irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., for the ethanol oxidation reaction). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Incargranine A&#160;Enabled by Bifunctional Iminophosphorane and Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;incargranine A, in nine steps. This was enabled by an enantioselective intramolecular organocatalysed desymmetrising Michael addition of a malonamate ester to a linked dienone substrate that established pivotal stereocentres in excellent enantio&#8208; and complete diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, a key hemiaminal intermediate was accessed by developing an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation, and the scope of this transformation was explored to produce a range of bicyclic hemiaminal motifs. Once installed, the hemiaminal motif was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade to access the natural product directly in a single step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>S&#8208;adenosylmethionine dependent methyltransferases are involved in countless biological processes, including signal transduction, epigenetics, natural product biosynthesis or detoxification. Only a hand full of carboxylate methyltransferases have evolved to participate in amide bond formation. In this report we show that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed F&#8208;methylation of carboxylate substrates produces F&#8208;methyl esters that readily react with N&#8208; or S&#8208;nucleophiles under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the synthesis of small amides, hydroxamates and thioesters, to site&#8208;specific protein modification and native chemical ligation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery&#8217;s lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Produced Light and Its Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules due to their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4 &#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4 &#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4 &#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby yielding a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 at ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for feasible C3H4 removal from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Gating of Selective Bacterial Membrane Interaction and Enhanced Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible biointerfaces are essential for on&#8208;demand molecular recognition to regulate stimuli responsive bioactivity such as specific interactions with cell membrane. The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells.&#160;Herein, we introduce a 2D&#8208;MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene&#160;that interacts selectively with either Gram&#8208;positive or Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a light&#8208;gated fashion. The&#160;trans conformation (trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) selectively kills Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive strain. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 selectively binds with bacterial membrane of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria than&#160;trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2. In case of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 and generate intracellular ROS&#160;to kill the bacteria. While the trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram&#8208;negative bacterial cells, cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H&#8208;bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo&#8208;controlled Gram&#8208;selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain&#8208;specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration,&#160;0.65 ug/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.</dc:description>

The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells.&#160;Herein, we introduce a 2D-MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene&#160;that interacts selectively with either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria in a light-gated fashion. The&#160;trans conformation (trans-Azo-MoS2) selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis-Azo-MoS2) under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strain. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis-Azo-MoS2 selectively binds with bacterial membrane of Gram-positive bacteria than&#160;trans-Azo-MoS2. In case of Gram-negative bacteria, trans-Azo-MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis-Azo-MoS2 and generate intracellular ROS&#160;to kill the bacteria. While the trans-Azo-MoS2exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram-negative bacterial cells, cis-Azo-MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram-positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo-controlled Gram-selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain-specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration,&#160;0.65 ug/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation of Ketones with 2&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric allylation of ketones under proton&#8208;transfer conditions is a challenging issue due to the limited pronucleophiles and the electrophilic inertness of ketones. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines work as synthetic equivalents of propanals. Upon the acidic workup, a formal asymmetric &#946;&#8208;addition of propanals to ketones is achieved. An investigation on KIE effect indicates that the deprotonation of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines is the rate&#8208;determining step, which generates nucleophilic allyl copper(I) species. Finally, the synthetic utility of the present method is demonstrated by the asymmetric syntheses of (R)&#8208;boivinianin A and (R)&#8208;gossonorol.</dc:description>

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8211;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8211;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8211;N4 into Mn&#8211;N3C and further into Mn&#8211;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8211;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8211;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8211;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99 V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59 s&#8211;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8209;like lectin&#8208;15 (Sigelc&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells/tumor infiltrating myeloid cells and mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Sigelc&#8208;15 protein/Sigelc&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the CO2 Conversion at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Nanoscale Visualization Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) battery technology presents a promising opportunity for carbon capture and energy storage. Despite tremendous efforts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the complex electrode/electrolyte/CO2 triple&#8208;phase interfacial processes remain poorly understood, in particular at the nanoscale. Here, using in situ atomic force microscopy and laser confocal microscopy&#8211;differential interference contrast microscopy, we directly observed the CO2 conversion processes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, and further revealed a laser&#8208;tuned reaction pathway based on real&#8208;time observations at the nanoscale. A bi&#8208;component composite of Li2CO3/C deposits as micron&#8208;sized clusters during discharge, obeying a 3D progressive growth model, and following a 3D decomposition pathway during the recharge. When the cell operates under laser irradiation, densely packed Li2CO3/C flakes deposit whose nucleation and growth processes deviate from the classical models. They predominantly decompose at the bottom interface, causing irreversible capacity degradation. In situ Raman shows that the laser promotes the formation of poorly soluble intermediates, which in turn affects growth/decomposition pathways of Li2CO3/C and the cell performance. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and the laser&#8208;tuned CO2 conversion reactions, which can inspire strategies of monitoring and controlling the multistep and multiphase interfacial reactions in advanced electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8208;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8208;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI-COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI-COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs-based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs-based energy storage materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiky Artificial Peroxidases with V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe Pair Sites for Combating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the sharp rise of antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens worldwide, it is of enormous importance to create new strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria . Here, we create an iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase (POD) with V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for combating methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized "capture and killing" bifunction from the spiky  morphology and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The V&#8208;Fe2O3 can reach nearly 100% bacterial inhibition over a long period by efficiently oxidizing the lipid membrane. Our wound disinfection results identify that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can not only efficiently eliminate MRSA and their biofilm but also accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity. This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8211;O&#8211;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.</dc:description>
