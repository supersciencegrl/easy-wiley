         <title>Fe, N&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Redistribution in NiCo Spinel on Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon for Bi&#8208;functional Oxygen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an interfacial electron&#160;redistribution is proposed to boost the activity of carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4&#160;catalyst toward oxygen conversion via Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy. Fe&#8208;doping into octahedron induces a redistribution of electrons between Co and Ni atoms on NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon. The increased electron density of Co promotes the coordination of water&#160;to Co sites and further&#160;dissociation. The generation of proton from water improves the overall activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The increased electron density of Ni facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies. The Ni&#8208;VO&#8208;Fe structure accelerates the deprotonation of *OOH to improve the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). N&#8208;doping modulates&#160;the electron density of carbon to form active sites for the adsorption and protonation of oxygen species. Fir wood&#8208;derived&#160;carbon endows&#160;catalyst with an integral structure to enable outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon&#160;express&#160;high half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.86 V in ORR and low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in OER. The zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) assembled with&#160;the as&#8208;prepared catalyst&#160;achieve long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 2000 cycles) with peak power density (180 mW&#8239;cm&#8208;2). Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy drives the catalysis&#160;of biomass&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based catalysts to the highest level for the oxygen conversion in ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Approaches to Fundamental Studies in Soft&#8208;Matter Physics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stretching a segment of a polymer beyond its contour length makes its (primarily backbone) bonds more dissociatively labile, which enables polymer mechanochemistry. Integrating some backbone bonds into suitably designed molecular moieties yields mechanistically and kinetically diverse chemistry, which is becoming increasingly exploitable. Examples include, most prominently, attempts to improve mechanical properties of bulk polymers, as well as prospective applications in drug delivery and synthesis. This review aims to highlight an emerging effort to apply the concepts and experimental tools of mechanochemistry to fundamental physical questions in soft matter. A succinct summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;knowledge of the field, with emphasis on foundational concepts and generalizable observations, is followed by analysis of 3 recent examples of mechanochemistry yielding molecular&#8208;level details of elastomer failure, macromolecular chain dynamics in elongational flows and kinetic allostery. We conclude with reasons to assume that the highlighted approaches are generalizable to a broader range of physical problems than considered to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials have been developed by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into a melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer by solution polymerization. Their afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively. Moreover, the resulting polymer films showed a color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow and outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances.







Abstract
In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively, under ambient conditions. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color could be linearly tuned between yellow and blue by adjusting the temperature, and it could still emit an intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68&#8197;s at 440&#8197;K. Moreover, the films showed a bright and stable white afterglow at 370&#8197;K with a lifetime of 2.80&#8197;s and maintained an excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150&#8197;days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting was also demonstrated.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Base Cascades in Zeotype Single Crystal for Sugar Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystal indium&#8208;containing zeolite catalyst with both Lewis acid and base sites intelligently participated in the isomerization of very high concentrations of glucose (33&#8201;%) to fructose in methanol, yielding 54.9&#8201;% fructose and recovering 93.9&#8201;% total sugar following tandem hydrolysis.







Abstract
The chemically catalyzed production of fructose syrup from high concentrations of glucose is crucial for the food industry and biorefining. In this work, a single crystal catalyst was synthesized via protective desilication of zeolite while incorporating indium. Glucose was isomerized in methanol at concentrations as high as 33&#8197;wt&#8201;% before being hydrolyzed with water. The final fructose production was 54.9&#8201;%, with 89.1&#8201;% selectivity and 93.3&#8201;% sugar recovery, the highest isomerization rate at the highest concentration ever reported. Indium was present in the single&#8208;crystal catalyst as oxide nanoparticles and boundary framework atoms, and it achieved intelligent cooperation in the production of fructose syrup in methanol by catalyzing isomerization and selective glycosidation, minimizing degradation due to fructose accumulation and eliminating side reactions. This study contributed to the advancement of the industrial practice of chemically catalyzed glucose isomerization.

         <title>P450&#8208;Modified Multicyclic Cyclophane&#8208;Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified 1,057 putative P450&#8208;modified RiPP gene clusters classified into 11 different clades. Gene clusters from Class&#8197;3 and 9, which encode multiple aromatic amino acids, were selected for heterologous expreesion. A total of 11 P450&#8208;modified multicyclic peptides were successfully characterized, with some containing unusual cyclophane linkers, demonstrating the powerful catalytic capabilities of P450 enzymes.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with cyclophane linkers are an attractive compound type owing to the fine&#8208;tuned rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450&#8208;modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11&#8197;classes. Focusing on two classes of P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring&#8208;forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane&#8208;containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.

         <title>Wavelength Selective Photocontrol of Hybrid Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran Photoswitches with Overlapping Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel photoswitch azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads which are connected in meta or para position. While in the meta&#8208;analogue the two switching units behaves orthogonally according to the meta&#8208;rule, we exploited the red&#8208;shift in the p&#8208;substituted compound to obtain decoupled switching moieties. These insights provide the basis for the development of new multichromic switches for information and energy storage or other applications.







Abstract
Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8208;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta&#8208;pattern. In the para&#8208;compound the spiro&#8208;connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red&#8208;shifted absorption. The azobenzene and the spiropyran can thus be addressed and switched independently by light of appropriate wavelength. Through the different connectivity patterns two different orthogonally photoswitchable systems have been obtained which are promising candidates for complex applications of light control.

         <title>Ambient Catalytic Spinning of Polyethylene Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently immobilized single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst inside nano&#8208;channels of the anodized Al2O3 membrane enables direct catalytic&#8208;spinning of multifilament PE nanofibers near room temperature. Confinement in the nano&#8208;pores has a positive influence on ethylene extrusion polymerization, namely on the chain&#8208;growth and chain&#8208;walking process&#8211;producing high&#8208;performance microstructures and morphologies.







Abstract
A novel single&#8208;atom Ni(II) catalyst (Ni&#8208;OH) is covalently immobilized onto the nano&#8208;channels of mesoporous Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA)&#8208;15 particles and isotropic Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) membrane for confined&#8208;space ethylene extrusion polymerization. The presence of surface&#8208;tethered Ni complexes (Ni@SBA&#8208;15 and Ni@AAO) is confirmed by the inductively coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the catalytic spinning process, the produced PE materials exhibit very homogeneous fibrous morphology at nanoscale (diameter: ~50&#8197;nm). The synthesized PE nanofibers extrude in a highly oriented manner from the nano&#8208;reactors at ambient temperature. Remarkably high Mw (1.62&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1), melting point (124&#8201;&#176;C), and crystallinity (41.8&#8201;%) are observed among PE samples thanks to the confined&#8208;space polymerization. The chain&#8208;walking behavior of surface tethered Ni catalysts is greatly limited by the confinement inside the nano&#8208;channels, leading to the formation of very low&#8208;branched PE materials (13.6/1000&#8197;C). Due to fixed supported catalytic topology and room temperature, the filaments are expected to be free of entanglement. This work signifies an important step towards the realization of a continuous mild catalytic&#8208;spinning (CATSPIN) process, where the polymer is directly synthesized into fiber shape at negligible chain branching and elegantly avoiding common limitations like thermal degradation or molecular entanglement.

         <title>Photoactivatable Engineering of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Inducible DNAzyme Probe for In Situ Imaging of Nuclear Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;switch DNAzyme system based on nuclear&#8208;localized CRISPR/Cas9 and 470&#8197;nm light activation is reported. The system enabled the in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of metal ions in the cell nucleus.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three&#8208;stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20&#8208;base&#8208;pair (20&#8208;bp) recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;inducible imaging of nuclear Zn2+ is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR&#8208;DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was demonstrated by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn2+ in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new analytical methods for nuclear metal&#8208;associated biology.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially controlled TiO2 surface decoration with Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self&#8208;organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt&#8208;TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co&#8208;catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCPP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6&#215;105&#8197;atoms&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state are maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.

&lt;p&gt;Spatially controlled TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface decoration with Pt single-atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self-organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt-TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co-catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron donation modulation rules are proposed to elucidate the formation mechanism and stability principle of LiNO3 as the single salt for electrolytes of nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. High donor&#8208;number solvents with strong electron&#8208;donation ability dissolve LiNO3 while low donor&#8208;number solvents with weak electron&#8208;donation ability regulate the AI&#8208;ISC structure to stabilize the electrolyte. The LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte enables remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance by improving the solvent reduction tolerance.







Abstract
LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200&#8197;cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Solid State Machinery of Multiple Dynamic Elements in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexible framework sliding governs the overall dynamical machinery. Moving elements, bicyclopentane, bipyridyls and azo groups, rotate with modulated dynamics in response to chemical stimuli such as I2 vapors and pressurized CO2 diffused into a pillared MOF.







Abstract
Engineering coordinated rotational motion in porous architectures enables the fabrication of molecular machines in solids. A flexible two&#8208;fold interpenetrated pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework precisely organizes fast mobile elements such as bicyclopentane (BCP) (107&#8197;Hz regime at 85&#8197;K), two distinct pyridyl rotors and E&#8208;azo group involved in pedal&#8208;like motion. Reciprocal sliding of the two sub&#8208;networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine&#8208;vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston&#8208;like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra&#8208;fast dynamics (107&#8197;Hz) at temperatures as low as 44&#8197;K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo&#8208;group in a crank&#8208;like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor&#8208;structure interplay.

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
Interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes are fabricated through electrophoresis. Reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation, endowing zinc ion capacitors with ultra&#8208;high stability.







Abstract
The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3&#8197;GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged. Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95&#8201;% after 20000&#8197;cycles at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production is synthesized through multi&#8208;component reactions. Continuous H2O2 production, photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.

&lt;p&gt;A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly-efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is synthesized through multi-component reactions. Continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, photo-self-Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water-mediated and catalyst-free multi-component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large-scale production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency of the photo-self-Fenton system using in situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo-Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large-scale continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalytic production and water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Deuterium Isotopes on Pt(II) Complexes and Their Impact on Organic NIR Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed general guidelines for the effect of deuterium isotopes on the NIR emission efficiency of Pt(II) complexes and common organic NIR emitters. Also, in this study the NIR OLED based on deuterated Pt(II) complex DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitter attains 796&#8197;nm electroluminescence with EQEmax of 16.6&#8201;% and radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which sets new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Insight into effect of deuterium isotopes on organic near&#8208;IR (NIR) emitters was explored by the use of self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) complexes H&#8208;3&#8208;f and HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, and their deuterated analogues D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, respectively (Scheme&#8197;2). In vacuum deposited thin film, albeit having nearly identical emission spectral feature maximized at ~810&#8197;nm, H&#8208;3&#8208;f and D&#8208;3&#8208;f exhibit remarkable difference in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 29&#8201;% and 50&#8201;%, respectively. Distinction in PLQY is also observed for HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (800&#8197;nm, 50&#8201;%) and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (798&#8197;nm, 67&#8201;%). We then elucidated the theoretical differences in the impact on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence between Pt(II) complexes and organic small molecules upon deuteration. The results establish a general guideline for the deuteration on NIR emission efficiency. From a perspective of practical application, NIR OLEDs based on D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitters attain EQEmax of 15.5&#8201;% (radiance 31,287&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 16.6&#8201;% (radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) at 764&#8197;nm and 796&#8197;nm, respectively, both of which set new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous All&#8208;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed by matching the S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples with rational electrode potential difference. The aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high specific capacity and discharge voltage, contributing to an enhanced energy density.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising energy storage devices because of their high safety and low cost. However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion&#8208;inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge&#8208;carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two&#8208;electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer, from electrons of a gold nanocluster core to reductive Ru (II) active center in the hybrid layer, is presented to overcome the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species. The proposed nanoplatform&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy leads to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs currently dominate the field of chemotherapeutic agents; however, achieving the controlled activation of metal prodrugs remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a universal strategy for the radiation&#8208;triggered activation of metal prodrugs via nanosurface energy transfer (NSET). The core&#8211;shell nanoplatform (Ru&#8208;GNC) is composed of gold nanoclusters (GNC) and ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;containing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid coatings. Upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, chemotherapeutic Ru (II) complexes were released in a controlled manner through a unique NSET process involving the transfer of photoelectron energy from the radiation&#8208;excited Ru&#8208;GNCs to the Ru&#8208;containing hybrid layer. In contrast to the traditional radiation&#8208;triggered activation of prodrugs, such an NSET&#8208;based system ensures that the reactive species in the tumor microenvironment are present in sufficient quantity and are not easily quenched. Additionally, ultrasmall Ru&#8208;GNCs preferably target mitochondria and profoundly disrupt the respiratory chain upon irradiation, leading to radiosensitization by generating abundant reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ru&#8208;GNC&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy induces immunogenic cell death, resulting in significant therapeutic outcomes when combined with the programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) checkpoint blockade. This NSET strategy represents a breakthrough in designing radiation&#8208;triggered nanoplatforms for metal&#8208;prodrug&#8208;mediated cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.

         <dc:description>
Here, a near surface high&#8208;entropy zone was fabricated into single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. This synergistic effect can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding and formation of intragranular nanocracks.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials for their high reversible capacity, but they suffer from fast structural degradation during cycling. Here, we report the Ce/Gd incorporated single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode materials with significantly enhanced cycling stability. The Gd ions are adequately incorporated in SC&#8208;NCM while Ce ions are prone to aggregate in the outer surface, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;entropy zone in the near&#8208;surface of SC&#8208;NCM, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 (LCGO) shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. The high&#8208;entropy zone can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution and prevent the formation of oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, it leads to a greatly improved H2&#8208;H3 phase transformation reversibility and mitigated stress/strain caused by Li&#8208;ion extraction/insertion during (de)lithiation process. The synergetic effects of reduced oxygen vacancies concentration and mitigated stress/strain can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding as well as the formation of intragranular nanocracks. Consequently, Ce/Gd incorporated SC&#8208;NCM (SC&#8208;NCM@CG2) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 219.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups has been reported. TBAF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O exhibits high compatibility, allowing for easy incorporation of fluoride into SF5 and SF4 alkynes at room temperature. Competitive experiments and DFT calculations verify that SF5 alkynes react much faster than SF4 alkynes.







Abstract
The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanting SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Secondary&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Construction of a Polar Material Exhibiting Strong Broad&#8208;Spectrum Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven strategy for the construction of the first noncentrosymmetric vanadyl iodate lacking additional counter cations, VO2(H2O)(IO3), which possesses strong second&#8208;harmonic generation and sufficient birefringence, was reported.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity&#8208;, piezoelectricity&#8208; and, particularly, optical nonlinearity&#8208;related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non&#8208;directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter&#8208;cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter&#8208;cation&#8208;free iodate, VO2(H2O)(IO3) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1200&#8197;nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546&#8197;nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Precisely Manipulating Molecular Packing via Tuning Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Topology Enabling High&#8208;Performance Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with precisely regulated alkyl side&#8208;chains. It is found that tuning the topology of alkyl side&#8208;chains can effectively manipulate molecular assemble. Hence, the NFREA DPA&#8208;4 with asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chains exhibits a tight packing and high crystallinity, thus contributing to improved electron mobility and boosted power conversion efficiency (16.67&#8201;%).







Abstract
In the development of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the self&#8208;organization of organic semiconductors plays a crucial role. This study focuses on the precisely manipulation of molecular assemble via tuning alkyl side&#8208;chain topology in a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Among the three NFREAs investigated, DPA&#8208;4, which possesses an asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chain length, exhibits a tight packing in the crystal and high crystallinity in the film, contributing to improved electron mobility and favorable film morphology for DPA&#8208;4. As a result, the OSC device based on DPA&#8208;4 achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency of 16.67&#8201;%, ranking among the highest efficiencies for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>In situ Implanting 3D Carbon Network Reinforced Zinc Composite by Powder Metallurgy for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;based Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work provides a novel understanding of in situ implanted carbon network reinforcing Zn anode by powder metallurgy, moving from the surface/interface modification of Zn foil to the bulk phase regulation of Zn powder. The carbon network as an electron transport channel enhances the conductivity of the electrode and provides more nucleation sites to inhibit the growth of dendrites, realizing a highly reversible Zn anode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

&lt;p&gt;Our work provides a novel understanding of in situ implanted carbon network reinforcing Zn anode by powder metallurgy, moving from the surface/interface modification of Zn foil to the bulk phase regulation of Zn powder. The carbon network as an electron transport channel enhances the conductivity of the electrode and provides more nucleation sites to inhibit the growth of dendrites, realizing a highly reversible Zn anode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn-based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid-scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, the dendrite formation, side reactions, and corrosion on anode have overshadowed their practical applications. Herein, we present an in situ grown carbon network reinforcing Zn matrix anode prepared by powder metallurgy. This carbon network provides an uninterrupted internal electron transport pathway and optimize the surface electric field distribution, thereby enabling highly reversible Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetrical cells demonstrate impressive stability, running for over 880&#8197;h with a low voltage hysteresis (&#8776;32&#8197;mV). Furthermore, this Zn matrix composite anode exhibits enhanced performance in both the aqueous Zn-ion and the Zn-air batteries. Notably, Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells display superior rate capabilities, while Zn-air batteries deliver high power density and impressive Zn utilization rate (84.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene Quencher&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanomedicine for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored chemodynamic therapy agent (Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) is prepared by integrating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters via host&#8211;guest interaction. In addition to producing &#8901;OH, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and H2O2 causes Fc oxidation and consequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, allowing renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to self&#8208;monitor &#8901;OH formation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) generation is crucial for both the efficacy and safety of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although &#8901;OH probe&#8208;integrated CDT agents can track &#8901;OH production by themselves, they often require complicated synthetic procedures and suffer from self&#8208;consumption of &#8901;OH. Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self&#8208;monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The water&#8208;soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron&#8208;donating ability to effectively quench the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8901;OH and therefore allowed Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to in situ self&#8208;report &#8901;OH generation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption. Such a NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored CDT enabled the use of renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

         <title>Engineering Tunable Ratiometric Dual Emission in Single Emitter&#8208;based Amorphous Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular structural strategy enabling single emitter based dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms is presented. The developed amorphous films endow in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics to show highly controllable multiple luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission), which benefits to the construction of an irreplaceable set of optical information combination.







Abstract
Molecular emitters with multi&#8208;emissive properties are in high demand in numerous fields, while these properties basically depend on specific molecular conformation and packing. For amorphous systems, special molecular arrangement is unnecessary, but it remains challenging to achieve such luminescent behaviors. Herein, we present a general strategy that takes advantage of molecular rigidity and S1&#8208;T1 energy gap balance for emitter design, which enables fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms, whether crystalline or amorphous. Subsequently, the amorphism of the emitters based polymethyl methacrylate films endowed an in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics. With the ratiometric regulation of phosphorescence by external stimuli and stable fluorescence as internal reference, highly controllable luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission) was achieved. There properties together with a persistent luminous behavior is of benefit for an irreplaceable set of optical information combination, featuring an ultrahigh&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting ability. Our research introduces a concept of eliminating the crystal&#8208;form and molecular&#8208;conformational dependence of complex luminescent properties through emitter molecular design. This has profound implications for the development of functional materials.

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size of support significantly affects the reaction orientation of the light&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation. Small&#8208;size TiO2 supporting nickel exhibits enhanced metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) and enables more light&#8208;induced electrons on TiO2 to transfer to Ni, thereby accelerating the H2 decomposition and CO2 methanation process.







Abstract
The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with selectivity of 99.8&#8201;%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% with rate of 30.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy was proposed to achieve significantly improved properties than that of commercial NCM&#8208;811. Configurational disorder originated from high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer provides higher structure stability to trigger anion redox activity while electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity provides higher anion redox activity.

LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM&#8208;811) exhibits the highest capacity in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), and the high Ni content (80&#8201;%) provides the only route for high energy density. However, the cationic structure instability arisen from the increase of Ni content (&gt;80&#8201;%) limits the further increase of the capacity, and inevitable O2 release related to anionic structure instability hinders the utilization of anion redox activity. Here, by comparing various combinations of high&#8208;entropy dopants substituted Co element, we propose a low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy to fabricate the high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free layered cathode (LiNi0.8Mn0.12Al0.02Ti0.02Cr0.02Fe0.02O2) that exhibits much higher capacity and cycling stability. Configurational disorder originated from cationic high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer, anchors the oxidized lattice oxygen ((O2)n&#8722;) to preserve high (O2)n&#8722; content, triggering the anion redox activity. Electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity than that of Co element, increases the electron density of O in TM&#8208;O octahedron (TM&#8208;O6) configuration to reach higher (O2)n&#8722; content, resulting in the higher anion redox activity. With exploring the stabilization effect on both cations and anions of high&#8208;entropy doping and low&#8208;electronegativity cationic modified anion redox activity, we propose an innovative and variable pathway for rationally tuning the properties of commercial cathodes.

Configurational disorder originated from high-entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer provides higher structure stability to trigger anion redox activity while electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity provides higher anion redox activity.

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility in ester electrolytes and proposed a new multivalent low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design to achieve intrinsic LiNO3 solubilization. Linear esters with higher multivalency leads to more stable solvation structures and a monotonic increase in LiNO3 solubility of up to 0.8&#8197;M. Our findings offer new fundamental insights into the LiNO3 solvation chemistry.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte formed via diluting ionic liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent is proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. It presents better fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, as well as a faster kinetics, enabling a long&#8208;life&#8208;span Al&#8722;S batteries under &#8722;20&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8722;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8722;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. For instance, Al&#8722;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while only 229&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>

Water electrolysis coupling spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox reaction realizes energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production at low electricity costs, while realizing spent LFP materials to value&#8208;added LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4 for cost&#8208;effective and environment&#8208;friendly recycling of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LFP batteries.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87&#8197;V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 43&#8201;% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.

         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>

The complementary research strategy (involving catalysis, operando UV/Vis, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) bridges the mechanistic gap between Koch&#8208;type carbonylation&#8208;led direct and dual cycle mechanisms during the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process.







Abstract
A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV/Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8722;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Derived Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mesoionic, six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins derived from 3&#8208;methylpyridinium ions (py&#8208;mNHOs) is reported. Py&#8208;mNHOs are among the most reactive neutral nucleophiles on the Mayr scale. Additionally, they are 1,3&#8208;dipoles that undergo dearomative (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions with dipolarophiles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to analyze the gradual transition from stepwise adduct formation to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
Mesoionic polarization allows access to electron&#8208;rich olefins that have found application as organocatalysts, ligands, or nucleophiles. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of 3&#8208;methylpyridinium&#8208;derived mesoionic olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs). We used a DFT&#8208;supported design concept, which showed that the introduction of aryl groups in the 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 4&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions of the heterocyclic core allowed the kinetic stabilization of the novel mesoionic compounds. Tolman electronic parameters indicate that py&#8208;mNHOs are remarkably strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands toward transition metals and main group Lewis acids. Additionally, they are among the strongest nucleophiles on the Mayr reactivity scale. In reactions of py&#8208;mNHOs with electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems, a gradual transition from the formation of zwitterionic adducts via stepwise to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was observed experimentally and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with a multidimensional 28&#8208;MR extra&#8208;large pore channel, has been hydrothermally synthesized from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor, assisted by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Possessing not only superior crystallinity and hydrothermal stability, but also &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS is the high&#8208;silica zeolite containing the largest pore opening to date.







Abstract
A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8722;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8722;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1&#8201;% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4&#8201;%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts within 3&#8197;min. Specifically, the optimized single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon materials (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) based on a metal&#8211;organic framework precursor showcases a tremendous CO partial current density of 1.06&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96&#8201;% in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.

         <title>The Influence of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces on Organic Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability Revealed through Theoretical Calculations and Morphology Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>

The donor/acceptor interface structures and features show an obvious influence on blending phase&#8208;separation morphology and charge transport behavior. It is not reasonable to simply judge the quality of fluorinated and chlorinated acceptors without suitable selection of donors, and regulating donor/acceptor interfaces can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel acceptors.







Abstract
End&#8208;groups halogenation strategies, generally refers to fluorination and chlorination, have been confirmed as simple and efficient methods to regulate the photoelectric performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), but a controversy over which one is better has existed for a long time. Here, two novel NFAs, C9N3&#8208;4F and C9N3&#8208;4Cl, featured with different end&#8208;groups were successfully synthesized and blended with two renowned donors, D18 and PM6, featured with different electron&#8208;withdrawing units. Detailed theoretical calculations and morphology characterizations of the interface structures indicate NFAs based on different end&#8208;groups possess different binding energy and miscibility with donors, which shows an obvious influence on phase&#8208;separation morphology, charge transport behavior and device performance. After verified by other three pairs of reported NFAs, a universal conclusion obtained as the devices based on D18 with fluorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs and PM6 with chlorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs generally show excellent efficiencies, high fill factors and stability. Finally, the devices based on D18: C9N3&#8208;4F and PM6: C9N3&#8208;4Cl yield outstanding efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% and 18.00&#8201;%, respectively. Suitably selecting donor and regulating donor/acceptor interface can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel NFAs, which points out the way for further molecular design and selection for high&#8208;performance and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor cell membrane reactors are constructed in vivo for the precise location control of prodrug activation, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting liposomes install the bioorthogonal trigger on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that activates an externally delivered prodrug in situ.







Abstract
The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96&#8197;h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to strengthen and stabilize the supramolecular polymer network is reported. The superb multivalence cooperation makes the hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect, resulting in a superroubst and recyclable supramolecular polymer network with remarkably high resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and H&#8208;bond&#8208;destructive solvents.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>

Manganese&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide nanoparticles enhanced dendritic cell maturation via intracellular glutathione depletion and subsequent STING pathway activation. Effective antigen delivery and presentation mediated by the nanoparticles significantly triggered antitumor immune response and inhibited tumor growth in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings.







Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.

         <title>Activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 Signaling and Inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; Checkpoint with a Dual siRNA&#8208;Assembled Nanoadjuvant for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an RNA nanoadjuvant loaded with densely packed siRNA and covered with cationic liposomes. With high&#8208;order RNA structure, it works like an RNA virus to robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling to drive the maturation of APCs. Moreover, dual gene silencing of CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs leads to efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint, thereby enhancing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by APCs for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti&#8208;tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self&#8208;assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti&#8208;tumor M1&#8208;like phenotype. In addition, with a well&#8208;designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross&#8208;priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;We present an RNA nanoadjuvant loaded with densely packed siRNA and covered with cationic liposomes. With high-order RNA structure, it works like an RNA virus to robustly activate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling to drive the maturation of APCs. Moreover, dual gene silencing of CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs leads to efficient inhibition of the CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint, thereby enhancing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by APCs for cancer immunotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti-tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47-SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self-assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype. In addition, with a well-designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross-priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti-tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized Oxidation Embellishing Strategy Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy is introduced by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on SnO2 electron transport layer in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). The LOE strategy induces plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 on the SnO2 surface, reducing surface oxygen vacancies and realizing benign energy alignment. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 based pero&#8208;SC treated by the LOE strategy achieves power conversion efficiency of 25.72&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) has attracted extensive studies as a promising photovoltaic technology, wherein the electron extraction and transfer exhibit pivotal effect to the device performance. The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed the recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero&#8208;SCs, yet still suffers from surface defects of SnO2 nanoparticles which brings energy loss and phase instability. Herein, we report a localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on the SnO2 ETL. The LOE strategy builds up plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 and the nano&#8208;heterojunctions compensate the surface defects and realize benign energy alignment, which reduces surface non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss of the pero&#8208;SCs. Meanwhile, the decrease of lattice mismatch released the lattice distortion and eliminated tensile stress, contributing to better stability of the devices. The pero&#8208;SCs based on &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with the SnO2 ETL treated by the LOE strategy realized a PCE of 25.72&#8201;% (certified as 25.41&#8201;%), along with eminent stability performance of T90&gt;700&#8197;h. This work provides a brand&#8208;new view for defect modification of SnO2 electron transport layer.

Anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals synthesized by one&#8208;step mechanochemical method for high&#8208;efficiency photo&#8208;thermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Halogen anion counterions serve as the efficient electron source of donors with skeleton atoms unchanged and bring great convenience to the rational design &amp; synthesis of functional cocrystals.







Abstract
An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Templated Fabrication of Ultrathin Electroactive Gold Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale (width of ~20&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (0.49&#8197;nm) amorphous Au nanosheets are synthesized at room temperature in an aqueous solution using DNA nanosheets with extended single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a larger spacing (16.7&#8197;nm) for the first time. The extended ssDNA induces metallization and enables further precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions.







Abstract
Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.

         <dc:description>
A series of defect&#8208;free 2,2&#8242;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers with different tether lengths was synthesized by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source. The helical geometries can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle with variations in the alkylenedioxy tethering groups, leading to a strong circularly polarized luminescence.

We now report the first successful synthesis of a series of optically&#8208;pure 2,2&#8242;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded helical ladder polymers based on quantitative and chemoselective ladderization by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source, inaccessible by the conventional approach lacking the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents. Due to the defect&#8208;free helix formation, the circular dichroism signal increased by more than 6&#8197;times the previously reported value. The resulting helical secondary structure can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle in the repeating unit with variations in the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;alkylenedioxy tethering groups by one carbon atom at a time. The optimization of the helical ladder structures led to a strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high fluorescence quantum yield (28&#8201;%) and luminescence dissymmetry factor (2.6&#215;10&#8722;3).

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction to Formate or CO with High Selectivity over a Covalent Organic Framework Covalently Anchored on Graphene Oxide</title>

The photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to HCOO&#8722; or CO can be significantly enhanced by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely studied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, pristine COFs usually exhibit low catalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this study, we fabricated a stable COF&#8208;based composite (GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co) by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, in absolute acetonitrile (CH3CN), GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co shows a high selectivity of 94.4&#8201;% for the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, with a formate yield of 15.8&#8197;mmol/g, which is approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. By contrast, in CH3CN/H2O (v&#8201;:&#8201;v=4&#8201;:&#8201;1), the main product for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co is CO (96.1&#8201;%), with a CO yield as high as 52.2&#8197;mmol/g, which is also approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. Photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate the covalent bonding of COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and GO to form the GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co composite facilitates charge separation and transfer significantly, thereby accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, theoretical calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal H2O can stabilize the *COOH intermediate to further form a *CO intermediate via O&#8722;H(aq)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(*COOH) hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the regulated photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Improving Rate Performance of Encapsulating Lithium&#8208;Polysulfide Electrolytes for Practical Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexyl methyl ether (HME) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent to formulate encapsulating lithium&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE). The sacrifice in specific capacity of S cathodes at a high rate in common EPSEs is circumvented in HME&#8208;EPSE while mitigating parasitic reactions of lithium polysulfides with lithium metal anodes. Both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a lithium&#8722;sulfur pouch cell.







Abstract
The cycle life of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is severely plagued by the incessant parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and reactive Li polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating Li&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE) emerges as an effective electrolyte design to mitigate the parasitic reactions kinetically. Nevertheless, the rate performance of Li&#8722;S batteries with EPSE is synchronously suppressed. Herein, the sacrifice in rate performance by EPSE is circumvented while mitigating parasitic reactions by employing hexyl methyl ether (HME) as a co&#8208;solvent. The specific capacity of Li&#8722;S batteries with HME&#8208;based EPSE is nearly not decreased at 0.1&#8197;C compared with conventional ether electrolytes. With an ultrathin Li metal anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) and a high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#8197;mgS&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a longer cycle life of 113&#8197;cycles was achieved in HME&#8208;based EPSE compared with that of 65&#8197;cycles in conventional ether electrolytes at 0.1&#8197;C. Furthermore, both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a Li&#8722;S pouch cell (2.7&#8197;Ah). This work inspires the feasibility of regulating the solvation structure of LiPSs in EPSE for Li&#8722;S batteries with balanced performance.

         <title>A Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>

A gigantic transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated polyoxometalate cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers was obtained and used for enhanced brain&#8208;targeted glioma therapy for the first time.







Abstract
Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0&#8197;nm &#215; 6.0&#8197;nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate the apoptosis pathway of glioma cells with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66&#8197;&#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cyclophanes by Chiral Sulfide Catalyzed Electrophilic Sulfenylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed an efficient method for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes through the catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the origin of enantioselectivity in this sulfenylation reaction.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes has been developed for the first time. This was achieved by using a new Lewis base catalyst and a new ortho&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted sulfenylating reagent. Using the substrates with low rotational energy barrier, the transformation proceeded through a dynamic kinetic resolution, and the high rotational energy barrier of the substrates allowed the reaction to undergo a kinetic resolution process. Meanwhile, this transformation was compatible with a desymmetrization process when the symmetric substrates were used. Various planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% ee). This approach was used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Density functional theory calculations showed that &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between the sulfenyl group and the aromatic ring in the substrate play a crucial role in enantioinduction in this sulfenylation reaction.

The butterfly metamorphosis Within the cocoon's shell (aryl methyl ethers) is encased a secret beauty (phenols), how to liberate it? In their Review (e202317257), Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes, and Bert&#8197;F. Sels et&#8197;al. comprehensively summarize the advancements and perspectives of lignin O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis). The presence of methoxy groups (cocoon) limits the chemical reactivity and the applicability of lignin&#8208;derived compounds. Through O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis), the reborn product (butterfly) rich in phenolic functionality can start a versatile new life with broader applications.

Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters own flexibly adjustable active sites and are promising functional drug carriers. In their Research Article (e202319700), Jiefei Wang, Bingyang Shi, Junwei Zhao et&#8197;al. designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) Ce3+/Ag+ co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster with blood brain barrier&#8208;traversing and mitochondrial targeting properties to solve the long&#8208;standing brain delivery problem of drugs for glioma. As the first brain&#8208;targeting POM drug, Ag+ specifically activates reactive oxygen species regulated apoptosis pathway of glioma and efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <dc:description>
The controlled activation of metal prodrugs presents an exciting opportunity for precise and safe cancer chemotherapy. A universal strategy of radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer was developed to address the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species, as reported by Fangman Chen, Wen Sun, Dan Shao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317943).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The controlled activation&lt;/b&gt; of metal prodrugs presents an exciting opportunity for precise and safe cancer chemotherapy. A universal strategy of radiation-triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer was developed to address the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species, as reported by Fangman Chen, Wen Sun, Dan Shao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202317943"&gt;(e202317943)&lt;/a&gt;. The proposed tool led to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment.

         <title>Dual Nature of Thiophene Harnessed in the Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters via Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Murai and Yamaguchi report on near&#8208;infrared emitters derived from the dithieno[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;f]azepine core. Low band gaps were achieved by fusing antiaromatic azepine with thiophene rings equipped with electron&#8208;accepting moieties, which relieves the antiaromaticity of azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure. This novel approach provides dyes with fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters are of great interest for applications in bioimaging and modern technology. Yet the design of such materials with decent characteristics is challenging due to intrinsic limitations. In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for compounds consisting of an antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine; on the other hand, it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.

         <title>Leveraging Expertise in Thermal Catalysis to Understand Plasma Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective outlines best practice in the design of plasma catalysis experiments. A water pumping model depicts the limitations of an exergonic reaction that surpasses thermodynamic equilibrium, where the pump represents the plasma. The leak back causes energy dissipation, depending on the water level in the upper reservoir (representing conversion) and the size of the leak (representing plasma activation of the product).







Abstract
Best practices in testing heterogeneous catalysts are translated to plasma&#8208;catalytic experiments. Independent determination of plasma&#8208;catalytic and plasma&#8208;chemical contributions is essential. Non&#8208;porous catalyst particles are preferred because active sites inside sub&#8208;micron pores cannot contribute. Temperature variation is needed to determine kinetics, despite the complexity of thermal effects in plasma. Rigorous checks on catalyst deactivation and mass balance are needed. Plasma enhanced reversed reactions should be minimized by keeping conversion low and far from thermodynamic equilibrium, preventing underestimation of the rate of forward reaction. In contrast, plasma&#8208;catalytic studies often aim at conversions surpassing thermodynamic equilibrium, not obtaining any information on kinetics. Calculation of catalyst activity per active sites (turn&#8208;over&#8208;frequency) requires also appropriate characterization to determine the number of active sites. The relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics for plasma&#8208;catalysis is discussed using endothermic decomposition of CO2 and exothermic synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2 as examples. Assuming Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanisms, the effect of excitation of reactant molecules on activation barriers and surface coverages are discussed, influencing reaction rates. The consequences of reversed reactions are considered. Plasma&#8208;catalysis with catalysts applied for thermal catalysis at much higher temperature should be avoided, as adsorbed species are bonded too strongly resulting in low rates.

         <title>Mesoscale Clusters in the Crystallisation of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a surge in research on mesoscale clusters of organic molecules in light of the limitations of classical nucleation theory. This mini&#8208;review offers a fresh perspective on calling upon nanoscale characterisation techniques to evaluate the interdependence of solution properties and sample treatment on cluster properties to go alongside their role in nucleation, all based on literature&#8208;based experimental evidence.







Abstract
The early stages of the molecular self&#8208;assembly pathway leading to crystal nucleation have a significant influence on the properties and purity of organic materials. This mini review collates the work on organic mesoscale clusters and discusses their importance in nucleation processes, with a particular focus on their critical properties and susceptibility to sample treatment parameters. This is accomplished by a review of detection methods, including dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Considering the challenges associated with crystallisation of flexible and large&#8208;molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients, the dynamic nature of mesoscale clusters has the potential to expand the discovery of novel crystal forms. By collating literature on mesoscale clusters for organic molecules, a more comprehensive understanding of their role in nucleation will evolve and can guide further research efforts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Substrate Specificity and Mechanistic Variability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates is summarized in this review article from the perspective of substrate specificity and mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation finds widespread application in academia and industry. And indeed, a number of processes have been implemented for the production of pharma and agro intermediates as well as flavors &amp; fragrances. Although these processes are all based on the use of late transition metals as catalysts, there is an increasing interest in the use of base metal catalysis in view of their lower cost and the expected different substrate scope. Catalysts based on cobalt have already shown their potential in enantioselective hydrogenation chemistry. This review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years on cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated substrates. We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.

The characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework of manganese dioxides endows this family of materials with rich physiochemical properties and wide applications in sustainable energy storage. This review timely covers recent advancements related to such materials, with a focus on the atomistic insights into their structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships that are critical to further advance these applications.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured manganese dioxides (MnO2), also known as octahedral molecule sieves (OMS), are widely studied in geochemistry, deionization, energy storage and (electro)catalysis. These functionalities originate from their characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework, which, with a high degree of structural polymorphism and rich surface chemistry, can reversibly absorb and transport various ions. An intensive understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationship is prerequisite for functionality optimization, which has been recently approached by implementation of advanced (in situ) characterizations providing significant atomistic sciences. This review will thus timely cover recent advancements related to OMS and their energy storage applications, with a focus on the atomistic insights pioneered by researchers including our group: the origins of structural polymorphism and heterogeneity, the evolution of faceted OMS crystals and its effect on electrocatalysis, the ion transport/storage properties and their implication for processing OMS. These studies represent a clear rational behind recent endeavors investigating the historically applied OMS materials, the summary of which is expected to deepen the scientific understandings and guide material engineering for functionality control.

         <title>Luminescent and Photoredox&#8208;Active Molybdenum(0) Complexes Competitive with Isoelectronic Ruthenium(II) Polypyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments concerning the photophysics and the photochemistry of molybdenum(0) complexes are reviewed. Molybdenum(0) is isoelectronic with ruthenium(II), but considerably more abundant and cheaper. Replacing photoactive ruthenium(II) complexes by molybdenum(0) compounds would be attractive for many different applications.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero&#8208;valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited&#8208;state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range. The molybdenum(0) complexes are stronger photoreductants than ruthenium(II) polypyridines and can therefore perform more challenging chemical reductions. The triplet nature of their luminescent MLCT states allows sensitization of photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to convert low&#8208;energy input radiation into higher&#8208;energy output fluorescence. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning luminescent molybdenum(0) complexes and highlights their application potential. Molybdenum is roughly 140&#8197;times more abundant and far cheaper than ruthenium, hence this research is relevant in the greater context of finding more sustainable alternatives to using precious and rare transition metals in photophysics and photochemistry.

         <title>Advancements and Perspectives toward Lignin Valorization via O&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;Demethylation (ODM) is a strategic tool to unlock lignin applications for drop&#8208;in and new commodity, fine &amp; specialty chemicals.







Abstract
Lignin represents the largest aromatic carbon resource in plants, holding significant promise as a renewable feedstock for bioaromatics and other cyclic hydrocarbons in the context of the circular bioeconomy. However, the methoxy groups of aryl methyl ethers, abundantly found in technical lignins and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals, limit their pertinent chemical reactivity and broader applicability. Unlocking the phenolic hydroxyl functionality through O&#8208;demethylation (ODM) has emerged as a valuable approach to mitigate this need and enables further applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the progress in the valorization of technical lignin and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals via ODM, both catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic reactions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the properties and potential applications of the O&#8208;demethylated products is presented, accompanied by a systematic overview of available ODM reactions. This review primarily focuses on enhancing the phenolic hydroxyl content in lignin&#8208;derived species through ODM, showcasing its potential in the catalytic funneling of lignin and value&#8208;added applications. A comprehensive synopsis and future outlook are included in the concluding section of this review.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent cluster materials and devices emerged rapidly in recent years. Their external quantum efficiencies reached &#8776;30&#8201;%, on the basis of ligand and device engineering. On account of the unique advantage of combining organic and inorganic components for enhanced luminescence properties and stability, cluster&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes hold promise for next&#8208;generation displays and lightings.







Abstract
Optoelectronic cluster materials emerge rapidly in recent years especially for light&#8208;emitting devices, owing to their 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting and unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures with tunable excited&#8208;state characteristics for thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence and inheritable photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;stability. However, for efficient electroluminescence, excited&#8208;state compositions of cluster emitters should be tuned through ligand engineering to enhance ligand&#8208;centered radiative components and reduce cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Nonetheless, the balance of optoelectronic properties requires delicate and controllable ligand functionalization. On the other hand, in addition to balancing carrier fluxes, it showed that device engineering, especially host matrixes and interfacial optimization, can not only alleviate triplet quenching, but also modify processing and passivate defects. As consequence, the record external quantum efficiencies of cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes already reached &#8776;30&#8201;%. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent cluster materials and discuss their structure&#8211;property relationships, which would inspire the continuous efforts making cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes competent as the new generation of displays and lighting sources.

         <title>Aromatic Ketones as Mild Presodiating Reagents toward Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ketone Na&#8208;9&#8208;FN&#8208;DME is rationally designed as a mild presodiating reagent by introducing a carbonyl group into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to balance the conjugated and inductive effect, thus demonstrating versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts, Na0.44MnO2 as an example achieves higher charge capacity and longer life after presodiation, and manifests structural stability upon prolonged presodiation time.







Abstract
Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1&#8197;V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.

In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9-Fluorenoneb (9-FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V (&lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na), respectively. Note that 9-FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na&lt;sub&gt;0.44&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, layered Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, polyanionic Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.91&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high-performance sodium-ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vitro Module Editing Of NRPS Enables Production Of Highly Potent Gq&#8208;Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Derived From Unculturable Plant Symbiont</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
YM&#8208;254890, YM&#8208;254891 and FR900359 are potent selective G protein inhibitors. FR900359 which is originally discovered from plant&#8208;symbiont bacteria shows the strongest activity. While YM&#8208;254890 and YM&#8208;254891 are culturable bacteria derived, the BGC for them is not reported. Here, we identified the BGC for YM&#8208;254890 by heterologous expression. Furthermore, rational editing of the BGC led to the production of FR900359 in culturable host.







Abstract
Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM&#8208;254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;in vitro module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type&#8208;I PKS BGCs, to edit YM&#8208;254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host strain.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine Learning models were trained on the antibacterial activity of 288 ruthenium&#8208;arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and utilised to predict novel compounds based on a virtual library. 54 new compounds were synthesised and found to possess a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate compared to the training set.







Abstract
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7&#8201;%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4&#8201;%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradical that exhibits highly dynamic behavior in solution leading to isomerization is presented. Among the various conformers, those that have significantly shorter distances between radical sites and thus can interact weakly through space dominate.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradicals, in which the radical sites exist as individual spin doublets with weak spin&#8208;spin interaction have not been known so far. Starting from monoradicals of the type [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) was treated with 1,6&#8208;dibromohexane, affording the brominated species {Br[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical {&#8901;[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P&#8208;centered biradical so far, approaching 100&#8201;%. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P&#8208;centered distonic radical anion (5&#8722;). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselectivity&#8208;tailored, photoenzyme&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of oxalates and oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines was possible by using a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAP variants with excellent selectivity (both giving up to 99&#8201;% e.e., E&gt;200). The enzymes were obtained by focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM)&#8208;guided stereodivergent protein engineering of fatty acid photodecarboxylase.







Abstract
Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R) or (S) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.

This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from &lt;i&gt;Chlorella variabilis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP) using the focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP-catalyzed light-driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Water Content in Polymer Gels Measured with Super&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous polymer systems play a key role in many applications and technological innovations. The fluorescence lifetime of a dye provides access to the number of water molecules in its vicinity, allowing the local water content of aqueous polymer networks to be studied with super&#8208;resolved fluorescence imaging. This method was applied to thermoresponsive microgels to study the water content in their swollen and collapsed state.







Abstract
Water molecules play an important role in the structure, function, and dynamics of (bio&#8208;)&#8201;materials. A direct access to the number of water molecules in nanoscopic volumes can thus give new molecular insights into materials and allow for fine&#8208;tuning their properties in sophisticated applications. The determination of the local water content has become possible by the finding that H2O quenches the fluorescence of red&#8208;emitting dyes. Since deuterated water, D2O, does not induce significant fluorescence quenching, fluorescence lifetime measurements performed in different H2O/D2O&#8208;ratios yield the local water concentration. We combined this effect with the recently developed fluorescence lifetime single molecule localization microscopy imaging (FL&#8208;SMLM) in order to nanoscopically determine the local water content in microgels, i.e. soft hydrogel particles consisting of a cross&#8208;linked polymer swollen in water. The change in water content of thermo&#8208;responsive microgels when changing from their swollen state at room temperature to a collapsed state at elevated temperature could be analyzed. A clear decrease in water content was found that was, to our surprise, rather uniform throughout the entire microgel volume. Only a slightly higher water content around the dye was found in the periphery with respect to the center of the swollen microgels.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Chirality in ClMBA2SnI4 2D Perovskite
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Sn&#8208;based 2D chiral perovskite ClMBA2SnI4 is reported showing appealing optical properties with a low band gap and a broad emission centered in the red part of the spectrum. Computational modelling describes both the chiral transfer effect on the band structure and the origin of broad emission. Preliminary correlations between the nature of chiral ligand and central atom on the chiroptical response of chiral perovskites are proposed.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8722;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA=1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12&#8197;eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7&#8197;eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8211;530&#8197;nm range. Density functional theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>

RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of xanthate&#8208;based RAFT agent and vinyl acetate&#8208;based monomer was developed and applied in photoinduced 3D printing, presenting a facile way to tune the mechanical properties of the printed objects.







Abstract
Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young's moduli, ranging from 7.6&#8197;MPa to 997.1&#8197;MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile hydrogen bonding&#8208;modulated crystallization strategy is developed to achieve highly&#8208;crystalline, uniform, and large&#8208;area CsPbI2Br films, enabling CsPbI2Br solar cells with record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under indoor illumination suggests its potential in the applications of powering the Internet of Things, etc.







Abstract
The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under 1000&#8197;lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Editing to Access Fused&#8208;BN&#8208;Heterocycles via Ring&#8208;Opening/C&#8722;H Borylation/Reductive C&#8722;B Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the tandem BBr3&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of tertiary cyclic amine, intramolecular C&#8722;H borylation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular B&#8722;Br/C&#8722;Br reductive coupling was developed. This method represents a simple route to construct the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8722;H borylation, accessing the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles

         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles can effectively penetrate human cell membranes. They are easy to synthesize, require only three positive charges for cell entry, and their uptake can be monitored by mass spectrometry due to the unique ability to trace bismuth. This discovery offers an alternative to fluorophore labeling and opens new possibilities for designing therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake and traceability.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter human cells as demonstrated by live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R8), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs. Mechanistic studies indicated an energy&#8208;dependent endocytic cellular uptake sensitive to inhibition by rottlerin, most likely involving macropinocytosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Carbonylation towards Chiral Isoindolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide as C1 source, enabling highly efficient synthesis of chiral isoindolinones, is reported. The robustness and synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. Moreover, the chiral isoindolinones also proved to be efficient chiral ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide, an essential and easily available C1 feedstock, remains challenging. Here, we disclosed an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation catalyzed by inexpensive and readily available cobalt(II) salt. The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.

         <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Hot Electron Energy on Ag Surface by Amine Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface coordination induces a substantial enhancement in plasmonic hot electron energy, thereby enabling the achievement of previously inaccessible visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=F, Cl) bonds using individual plasmonic metal.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Notably, hot carriers play a decisive role in plasmonic catalysis since only when their energy matches with the LUMO or HOMO energy of the reactant molecule, can the reaction be activated. However, the hot carrier energy depends on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the plasmonic metal substrate and the interaction with incident light. Tuning the hot carrier energy is of great significance for plasmonic catalysis but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the energy of hot electrons can be significantly elevated to an unprecedented level through the coordination of amines on Ag surface. The bonding of amines and Ag reduces the work function of nanoparticles, leading to the increase of hot electron energy by 0.4&#8197;eV. This enhancement of energy promotes the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=Cl, F) bonds upon excitation by visible light. This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon&#8208;mediated systems.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) with tunable nanomagnetism for ultra&#8208;high field (UHF)&#8208;tailored activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Under a 9 T MRI, the pH&#8208;sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &gt;10&#8208;fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8722;S&#8722;) ligands lead to short &#964;&#8242;m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8722;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;&#8242;m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9&#8197;T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH&#8197;5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.

Under a 9 T MRI, the pH-sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &amp;gt;10-fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low-field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand-mediated magnetism-conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3-mercaptopropionic acid ligand-coated silver-gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH-dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH-activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8722;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) ligands lead to short &#964;&#8242;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8722;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;&#8242;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9&#8197;T MRI field, the pH-sensitive changes in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&amp;gt;10-fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH&#8197;5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next-generation UHF-tailored smart MRI contrast agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified continuous flow process for the production of glycerol carbonate from bio&#8208;based glycidol and stoichiometric CO2 in the presence of a homogeneous organocatalyst. It features an unprecedented mechanism and fast CO2 capture rate, which set robust foundations for large scale operation.







Abstract
A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton's base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6&#8197;kg day&#8722;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7&#8197;kg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;L&#8722;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30&#8197;s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant ring strain has to be built up in pursuit of guangnanmycin A, a congener of the anticancer drug lead leinamycin. The challenge was met by liaising ring closing alkyne metathesis with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization. The signature disulfide was introduced by a thia&#8208;Michael addition reaction followed by an unusual thioether&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide swap. In the dense array, however, final oxidation of the primary alcohol was unsuccessful.







Abstract
Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone enabled the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed, most likely because of the exceptional sensitivity of the strained scaffold.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism is achieved by synthetic electron shuttle&#8208;activated transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture. It offers a new and efficient route to realize artificial bioenergy production, holding great promise in ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.







Abstract
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, a dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in the mitochondrion respiratory chain, a small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in the lipid bilayer facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and a proton. These facilitate an enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing a synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Bipolarolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B was achieved by using a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantiomerically enriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization, short pH&#8208;responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen&#8208;bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher&#8208;order structures.







Abstract
Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208;driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge.

     alt="pH-Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;-sheet Secondary Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using radical ring-opening polymerization, short pH-responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen-bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher-order structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence-defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;-helix and &#946;-sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure-driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence-defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide-&lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-Dimethylacrylamide copolymers via radical Ring-Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence-defined regions of &#946;-sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self-assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;-sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes for multiplex imaging, by incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds upon click reactions. These modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm, and high turn&#8208;on ratios up to 3184&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable the simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.

         <title>Hierarchically Responsive Alternating Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Tailored Interparticle Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is an essential tool for constructing structured materials with a wide range of applications. However, achieving ordered assembly structures with externally programmable properties in binary NP systems remains challenging. In this work, we assemble binary inorganic NPs into hierarchically pH&#8208;responsive alternating copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures in an aqueous medium by engineering the interparticle electrostatic interactions. The polymer&#8208;grafted NPs bearing opposite charges are viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;), and copolymerized into alternating nano&#8208;copolymers (ANCPs) driven by the formation of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanomers. The resulting ANCPs exhibit reversibly responsive &#8220;bond&#8221; length (i.e., the distance between nanomers) in response to the variation of pH in a range of ~7&#8208;10, allowing precise control over the surface plasmon resonance of ANCPs. Moreover, specific interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; can break up at pH &#8805; 11, leading to the dis&#8208;assembly of ANCPs into molecule&#8208;like dimers and trimers. These dimeric and trimeric structures can reassemble to form ANCPs owing to the resuming of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221;, when the pH value of the solution changes from 11 to 7. The hierarchically responsive nanostructures may find applications in such as biosensing, optical waveguide, and electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipolar Polymeric Protective Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant Lithium Metal Anode in Ethylene Carbonate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unstable interface between Li metal and ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes triggers continuous side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth, significantly impacting the lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a bipolar polymeric protective layer (BPPL) is developed using cyanoethyl (&#8208;CH2CH2C&#8801;N) and hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) polar groups, aiming to prevent EC&#8208;induced corrosion and facilitating rapid, uniform Li+ ion transport. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between &#8208;OH and EC facilitates the Li+ desolvation process and effectively traps free EC molecules, thereby eliminating parasitic reactions. Meanwhile, the &#8208;CH2CH2C&#8801;N group anchors TFSI&#8722; anions through ion&#8211;dipole interactions, enhancing Li+ transport and eliminating concentration polarization, ultimately suppressing the growth of Li dendrite. This BPPL enabling Li | Li cell stable cycling over 1500 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li | LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Li | LiFePO4 full cells display superior electrochemical performance. The BPPL provides a practical strategy to enhanced stability and performance in LMBs application.</dc:description>

         <title>Discriminating the Active Ru species towards the Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen from Peroxymonosulfate: Nanoparticles Surpass Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an exceptional reactive oxygen species in advanced oxidation processes for environmental remediation. Despite single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) representing the promising candidate for the selective generation of 1O2 from peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the necessity to meticulously regulate the coordination environment of metal centers poses a significant challenge in the precisely&#8208;controlled synthetic method. Another dilemma to SACs is their high surface free energy, which results in an inherent tendency for the surface migration and aggregation of metal atoms. We here for the first time reported that Ru nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the facile pyrolysis method behave as robust Fenton&#8208;like catalysts, outperforming Ru SACs, towards efficient activation of PMS to produce 1O2 with nearly 100% selectivity, remarkably improving the degradation efficiency for target pollutants. Density functional theory calculations have unveiled that the boosted PMS activation can be attributed to two aspects: (i) enhanced adsorption of PMS molecules onto Ru NPs, and (ii) decreased energy barriers by offering adjacent sites for promoted dimerization of *O intermediates into adsorbed 1O2. This study deepens the current understanding of PMS chemistry, and sheds light on the design and optimization of Fenton&#8208;like catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;directed C&#8211;H arylation is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize biaryl compounds without the need of the prefuctionalization of starting materials, or the installment and removal of directing groups on the substrate. A direct C&#8211;H arylation of simple arenes as limiting reactants remains a challenge. Here we disclose a non&#8208;directed C&#8211;H arylation of anisole derivatives as limiting reagents with aryl iodides under mild reaction conditions. The arylated products are obtained in synthetically useful yields and the arylation of bioactive molecules is also demonstrated. Key to the success of this methodology is the use of a one&#8208;step synthesized S,O&#8208;ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Luminescence Horizons in Macropolyhedral Heteroboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescence is observed in three novel macropolyhedral nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex chalcogenaboranes: Se2B17H17 (1), SeB17H19 (3) and SeB18H20 (4). This led us to the recognition that previously published macropolyhedral heteroborane species might also exhibit luminescence. Thus, the known nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex dithiaboranes S2B17H17 (2), n&#8208;S2B16H16 (5) and i&#8208;S2B16H16 (6) were synthesised and also found to exhibit a range of luminescent properties. These macropolyhedral species are very different from the previously unique fluorescent binary borane B18H22 in terms of their structural architectures, by the presence of borane cluster hetero atoms, and, as in the cases of 5 and 6, that their synthetic origins are not derived simply through the modification of B18H22 itself. They consequently greatly expand the possibilities of finding new luminescent inorganic borane species.</dc:description>

         <title>COF&#8208;Topological Quantum Material Nano&#8208;heterostructure for CO2 to Syngas Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient solar&#8208;driven syngas production (CO+H2 mixture) from CO2 and H2O with a suitable photocatalyst and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism are the desired approach towards the carbon recycling process. Herein, we report the design and development of a unique COF&#8208;topological quantum material nano&#8208;heterostructure, COF@TI with a newly synthesized donor&#8208;acceptor based COF and two dimensional (2D) nanosheets of strong topological insulator (TI), PbBi2Te4.The intrinsic robust metallic surfaces of the TI act as electron reservoir, minimising the fast electron&#8208;hole recombination process, and the presence of 6s2 lone pairs in Pb2+ and Bi3+ in the TI helps for efficient CO2 binding, which are responsible for boosting overall catalytic activity. In variable ratio of acetonitrile&#8208;water (MeCN:H2O) solvent mixture COF@TI produces syngas with different ratios of CO and H2. COF@TI nano&#8208;heterostructure enables to produce higher amount of syngas with more controllable ratios of CO and H2 compared to pristine COF. The electron transfer route from COF to TI was realized from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, charge density difference calculation, excited state lifetime and photoelectrochemical measurements. Finally, a probable mechanistic pathway has been established after identifying the catalytic sites and reaction intermediates by in&#8208;situ DRIFTS study and DFT calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Enhancement in Silica&#8208;Confined Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals by Suppression of Silanol&#8208;Induced Traps and Phase Impurities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detriments of intrinsic silanol groups in mesoporous silica to the photoluminescence (PL) of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) confined in the template have never been realized and clearly elucidated. Here, we disclose that the silanol induced Cs+ and Br&#8208; deficiencies prompt the generation of traps and CsPb2Br5 impurities. The temperature dependent PL spectra verify the higher energetic barrier of trap states in CsPbBr3 NCs confined in silanol&#8208;rich mesoporous silica. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra reveal the trapped state mediated broadband photoinduced absorption and long&#8208;lived decay pathway of CsPbBr3 NCs in silanol&#8208;rich templates. Remarkable improvement (maximal 160&#8208;fold) in PL quantum yields is realized by simple silanol elimination. This work demonstrates the detrimental effects of silanol sites on the PL properties of LHP NCs impregnated in mesoporous silica, and provides new perspective for ligand&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;quality LHP NCs in mesoporous templates by facile impregnation for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Modular Assembly of Imaging&#8208;Trackable Enzymatic Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great application potential in biomedicine, sensing, environmental remediation, etc. In the past decade, various strategies or technologies have been used to prepare and functionalize MNMs. However, the current preparation strategies of the MNMs were mainly following the pre&#8208;designed methods based on specific tasks to introduce expected functional parts on the various micro/nanocarriers, which lacks a universal platform and common features, making it difficult to apply to different application scenarios. Here, we have developed a modular assembly strategy based on host&#8208;guest chemistry, which enables the on&#8208;demand construction of imaging&#8208;trackable nanomotors mounted with suitable driving and imaging modules using a universal nanocarrier platform, according to different application scenarios. These assembled nanomotors exhibit ed enhanced diffusion behavior driven by enzymatic reactions. The loaded imaging functions were used to dynamically trace the swarm motion behavior of assembled nanomotors with corresponding fuel conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The modular assembly strategy endowed with host&#8208;guest interaction provides a universal approach to producing multifunctional MNMs in a facile and controllable manner, which paves the way for the future development of MNMs systems with programmable functions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates play pivotal roles in an array of essential biologic processes and&#160;are consequently involved in many diseases. To meet the needs&#160;of glycobiology&#160;research, chemical enzymatic and non&#8208;enzymatic methods&#160;have been&#160;developed to generate glycoconjugates with well&#8208;defined structures. Herein, harnessing the unique properties&#160;of C6&#8208;oxidized glycans, we report a straightforward and robust strategy for site&#8208; and&#160;stereo&#8208;selective glyco&#8208;modification of biomolecules with N&#8208;terminal tryptophan by&#160;a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which&#160;is not adapted to&#160;typical aldehyde substrates under&#160;biocompatible conditions. This method reliably delivers&#160;highly homogeneous glycoconjugates&#160;with stable&#160;linkages, which has&#160;great potential for&#160;functional modulation&#160;of&#160;peptides and proteins&#160;in glycobiology research. Moreover,&#160;this reaction&#160;can be performed&#160;at&#160;the glyco&#8208;sites&#160;of glycopeptides, glycoproteins and living cell surfaces in a&#160;site&#8208;specific manner. Control experiments indicated&#160;that the protected &#945;&#8208;O atom of aldehyde donors&#160;and free N&#8208;H bond of&#160;the tryptamine motif&#160;are crucial for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations&#160;demonstrated&#160;that the reaction exhibited&#160;a first&#8208;order dependence on both tryptophan and glycan, and deprotonation/rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale Local Contacts Enable&#160;Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with&#160;20.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent thermal stability and suitable bandgap (~1.7 eV) for tandem solar cell applications. However, the defect&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, low charge extraction efficiency, energy level mismatches, and so on render the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency inverted IPSCs remains challenging. Here, the use of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin&#8208;coated on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect&#8208;rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI2 nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron&#8208;hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80% (certified efficiency of 20.02%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p&#8208;i&#8208;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells&#12288;(IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron&#8208;selective interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Language of the Immunomodulatory Properties of Veillonella parvula Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Veillonella parvula, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of V. parvula, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Here we report about the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of V. parvula and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol&#8208;containing O&#8208;antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon. Whether a pro&#8208;inflammatory potential has been evidenced for the lipid A moiety, by contrast a plausible &#8220;immune modulating&#8221; action has been proposed for the peculiar O&#8208;antigen portion.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorous Peptide Amphiphile with Potent Antimicrobial Activity for the Treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced Sepsis and Chronic Wound Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising prevalence of global antibiotic resistance evokes the urgent need for novel antimicrobial candidates. Cationic lipopeptides have attracted much attention due to their strong antimicrobial activity, broad&#8208;spectrum and low resistance tendency. Herein, a library of fluoro&#8208;lipopeptide amphiphiles was synthesized by tagging a series of cationic oligopeptides with a fluoroalkyl tail via a disulfide spacer. Among the lipopeptide candidates, R6F bearing six arginine moieties and a fluorous tag shows the highest antibacterial activity, and it exhibits an interesting fluorine effect as compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated lipopeptides. The high antibacterial activity of R6F is attributed to its excellent bacterial membrane permeability, which further disrupts the respiratory chain redox stress and cell wall biosynthesis of the bacteria. By co&#8208;assembling with lipid nanoparticles, R6F showed high therapeutic efficacy and minimal adverse effects in the treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and chronic wound infection. This work provides a novel strategy to design highly potent antibacterial peptide amphiphiles for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Coordination Number of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by d&#8208;Band Center&#8208;Regulated Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is essential to&#160;probe the coordination number (CN) because it is&#160;a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X&#8208;ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt&#8208;SACs. It is disclosed that the CN&#8208;triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d&#8208;band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone&#8208;CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe&#8208;SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated CTL.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Encapsulating individual mammalian cells with biomimetic materials holds potential in ex vivo cell culture and engineering. However, current methodologies often present tradeoffs between homogeneity, stability, and cell compatibility.&#160;&#160;Here, inspired by bacteria that use proteins stably anchoring on their outer membranes to nucleate biofilm growth, we develop a single&#8208;cell encapsulating strategy by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator(DFN) to initiate the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. We find that among the tested structures, the tetrahedral DFN can evenly and stably reside on cell membranes, effectively initiating hybridization chain reactions, thus generating homogenously dense yet flexible single&#8208;cell encapsulation for diverse cell lines. The encapsulation purely consisting of DNA persists for up to 72 hours in a serum&#8208;containing cell culture environment, which is a ~70&#8208;fold improvement compared to that mediated by a single&#8208;stranded DNA nucleator. The metabolism and proliferation of the encapsulated cells are found suppressed, which however can be restored to the original efficiencies upon release, suggesting superior cell compatibility of the encapsulation. We also find that compared to naked cells, the encapsulated cells exhibit a lower autophagy level after undergoing mechanical stress, suggesting the protective effect of the DNA encapsulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Crystallinity of Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through an in situ Protection&#8208;Deprotection Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protection of neighbouring groups during imine condensation reactions modulates the reactivity of building units in the synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The reduced reactivity of the protected aldehyde precursor decelerates the kinetics, making the reaction more reversible and improving the crystallinity of 2D COFs.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as highly robust materials, showing significant potential for practical applications. However, the exclusive reliance on 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (Tp aldehyde) in the design of such COFs often results in the production of non&#8208;porous amorphous polymers when combined with certain amine building blocks. Attempts to adjust the crystallinity and porosity by a modulator approach are inefficient because Tp aldehyde readily forms stable &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked monomers/oligomers with various aromatic amines through an irreversible keto&#8208;enol tautomerization process. Our research employed a unique protection&#8208;deprotection strategy to enhance the crystallinity and porosity of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked squaramide&#8208;based 2D COFs. Advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies, including 1D 13C CPMAS, 1H fast MAS, 15N CPMAS, 2D 13C&#8722;1H correlation, 1H&#8722;1H DQ&#8208;SQ, and 14N&#8722;1H HMQC NMR were used to establish the atomic&#8208;level connectivity within the resultant COFs. The TpOMe&#8208;Sqm COFs synthesized utilizing this strategy have a surface area of 487&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, significantly higher than similar COFs synthesized using Tp aldehyde. Furthermore, detailed time&#8208;dependent PXRD, solid&#8208;state 13C CPMAS NMR, and theoretical DFT studies shed more light on the crystallization and linkage conversion processes in these 2D COFs. Ultimately, we applied this protection&#8208;deprotection method to construct novel keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked highly porous organic polymers with a surface area of 1018&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Bidirectional Neuronal Actuation by Uncaging with Violet and Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created a chromatically complimentary pair of caging chromophores from courmarin&#8208;102, by thionation of the exocyclic julolidine oxygen. This enabled wavelength selective photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;GABA on neurons with green versus violet light. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;Glu, violet and green light could be used for bidirectional neuronal actuation.







Abstract
We have developed a photochemical protecting group that enables wavelength selective uncaging using green versus violet light. Change of the exocyclic oxygen of the laser dye coumarin&#8208;102 to sulfur, gave thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102, a new chromophore with an absorption ratio at 503/402&#8197;nm of 37. Photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid was found to be highly wavelength selective on neurons, with normalized electrical responses &gt;100&#8208;fold higher in the green versus violet channel. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102 caged glutamate, we could use whole cell violet and green irradiation to fire and block neuronal action potentials with complete orthogonality. Localized irradiation of different dendritic segments, each connected to a neuronal cell body, in concert with 3&#8208;dimenional Ca2+ imaging, revealed that such inputs could function independently. Chemical signaling in living cells always involves a complex balance of multiple pathways, use of (thio)&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged compounds will enable arbitrarily timed flashes of green and violet light to interrogate two independent pathways simultaneously.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of TNA Protects DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) accepts threose nucleic acid (TNA) nucleotide substrates, and catalyzes de novo synthesis of TNA on the 3&#8217; ends of DNA oligonucleotides. The TNA extension protects DNAs from nuclease digestion, and the DNA&#8208;TNA chimeras are used directly as staple strands in the self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). The TNA&#8208;shielded DONs are more biologically stable under the physiological environment.







Abstract
Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) are synthetic genetic polymers with improved biological stabilities and offer powerful molecular tools such as aptamers and catalysts. However, XNA application has been hindered by a very limited repertoire of tool enzymes, particularly those that enable de novo XNA synthesis. Here we report that terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) catalyzes untemplated threose nucleic acid (TNA) synthesis at the 3&#8217; terminus of DNA oligonucleotide, resulting in DNA&#8208;TNA chimera resistant to exonuclease digestion. Moreover, TdT&#8208;catalyzed TNA extension supports one&#8208;pot batch preparation of biostable chimeric oligonucleotides, which can be used directly as staple strands during self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). Such TNA&#8208;protected DONs show enhanced biological stability in the presence of exonuclease I, DNase&#8197;I and fetal bovine serum. This work not only expands the available enzyme toolbox for XNA synthesis and manipulation, but also provides a promising approach to fabricate DONs with improved stability under the physiological condition.

         <title>Coupling Electron Transfer and Redox Site in Boranil Covalent Organic Framework Toward Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based boranil covalent organic framework (M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalysts are fabricated through the post&#8208;functionalization strategy. Density functional theory and experimental studies unveiled the synergistic effect of metal (Ni) and BF2 moiety that alter the electronic band structures and charge carrier mobility, leading to a lower energy barrier for boosting oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The efficient polymeric semiconducting photocatalyst for solar&#8208;driven sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer oxygen evolution has spurred scientific interest. However, existing photocatalysts limited by &#960;&#8208;conjugations, visible&#8208;light harvest, and charge transfer often compromise the O2 production rate. Herein, we introduced an alternative strategy involving a boranil functionalized&#8208;based fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated ordered donor and acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalyst. The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 exhibits an excellent ~11&#8208;fold photocatalytic water oxidation rate, reaching 1404&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation compared to pristine Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF (123&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) alone and surpasses to reported organic frameworks counterpart. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the push/pull mechanism (metalloporphyrin/BF2) is responsible for the appropriate light&#8208;harvesting properties and extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation through chelating BF2 moieties. This strategy benefits in narrowing band structure, improving photo&#8208;induced charge separation, and prolonged charge recombination. Further, the lower spin magnetic moment of M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 and the closer d&#8208;band center of metal sites toward the Fermi level lead to a lower energy barrier for *O intermediate. Reveal the potential of the functionalization strategy and opens up an alternative approach for engineering future photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with alkynoate esters is presented. The reaction provides alkenylated products in high yields and selectivities that are primed for diverse downstream derivatizations.







Abstract
An enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with but&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate ester coupling partners employing thioamide directing groups is presented. The method is operationally simple and requires only mild reaction conditions, while providing alkenylated products as single regioisomers in excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and high enantiomeric excess [up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 enantiomeric ratio (er), or up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er after a single recrystallization]. Diverse downstream derivatizations of the products are demonstrated, delivering a range of enantioenriched constructs. Extensive computational studies using density functional theory provide insight into the detailed reaction mechanism, origin of enantiocontrol, and the unusual regioselectivity of the alkenylation reaction.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Conjugated Electrolytes as Biomimetics of Lipid Bilayers for In Vivo Liposome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the existing dye leakage drawback, lipophilic cyanine dyes are still widely used to track liposomes and other lipid systems. In this study, we have revolutionized the lipophilic dye structure by mimicking the entire lipid bilayer, rather than a single lipid molecule. The new conjugated electrolyte&#8208;based probes exhibit excellent compatibility with the lipid membrane, coupled with superior and readily adjustable photophysical properties.







Abstract
Liposomes serve as promising and versatile vehicles for drug delivery. Tracking these nanosized vesicles, particularly in vivo, is crucial for understanding their pharmacokinetics. This study introduces the design and synthesis of three new conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecules, which emit in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, these CEs, acting as biomimetics of lipid bilayers, demonstrate superior compatibility with lipid membranes compared to commonly used carbocyanine dyes like DiR. To counteract the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, CEs employ a twisted backbone, as such their fluorescence intensities can effectively enhance after a fluorophore multimerization strategy. Notably, a &#8220;passive&#8221; method was employed to integrate CEs into liposomes during the liposome formation, and membrane incorporation efficiency was significantly promoted to nearly 100%. To validate the in vivo tracking capability, the CE&#8208;containing liposomes were functionalized with cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptides, serving as tumor&#8208;targeting ligands. Clear fluorescent images visualizing tumor site in living mice were captured by collecting the NIR&#8208;II emission. Uniquely, these CEs exhibit additional emission peak in visible region, enabling in vitro subcellular analysis using routine confocal microscopy. These results underscore the potential of CEs as a new&#8208;generation of membrane&#8208;targeting probes to facilitate the liposome&#8208;based medicine research.

     alt="NIR-II Conjugated Electrolytes as Biomimetics of Lipid Bilayers for In Vivo Liposome Tracking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the existing dye leakage drawback, lipophilic cyanine dyes are still widely used to track liposomes and other lipid systems. In this study, we have revolutionized the lipophilic dye structure by mimicking the entire lipid bilayer, rather than a single lipid molecule. The new conjugated electrolyte-based probes exhibit excellent compatibility with the lipid membrane, coupled with superior and readily adjustable photophysical properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liposomes serve as promising and versatile vehicles for drug delivery. Tracking these nanosized vesicles, particularly &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, is crucial for understanding their pharmacokinetics. This study introduces the design and synthesis of three new conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecules, which emit in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II), facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, these CEs, acting as biomimetics of lipid bilayers, demonstrate superior compatibility with lipid membranes compared to commonly used carbocyanine dyes like &lt;b&gt;DiR&lt;/b&gt;. To counteract the aggregation-caused quenching effect, CEs employ a twisted backbone, as such their fluorescence intensities can effectively enhance after a fluorophore multimerization strategy. Notably, a &#8220;passive&#8221; method was employed to integrate CEs into liposomes during the liposome formation, and membrane incorporation efficiency was significantly promoted to nearly 100%. To validate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tracking capability, the CE-containing liposomes were functionalized with cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) peptides, serving as tumor-targeting ligands. Clear fluorescent images visualizing tumor site in living mice were captured by collecting the NIR-II emission. Uniquely, these CEs exhibit additional emission peak in visible region, enabling &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; subcellular analysis using routine confocal microscopy. These results underscore the potential of CEs as a new-generation of membrane-targeting probes to facilitate the liposome-based medicine research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Rhodium&#8208;Carbynoid in [2+1+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared, and it was applied in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time, affording various imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles under mild conditions. This strategy involved a unique trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh), wherein three new chemical bonds were forged at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of trifluoromethyl in a single step.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) possessing dual carbene&#8208;carbocation behavior emulated as trifluoromethyl metal&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=M) has not been explored yet, and its reaction characteristics are unknown. Herein, a novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared and used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time with commercially available N&#8208;fused heteroarenes and nitriles, yielding a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles that are of interest in medicinal chemistry, in which the insertion of trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) into C=N bonds of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes was involved. This strategy demonstrates synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals, construction of CD3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles, gram&#8208;scale experiments, and synthesis of phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor analog. These highly valuable and modifiable imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles exhibit good antitumor activity in vitro, thus demonstrating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Development of Mannosylated Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Cancer Vaccine with High Antigen Presentation Efficiency and Immunomodulatory Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to promote the antitumor efficacy of mRNA vaccines, sweet lipid nanoparticles (STLNPs&#8208;Man) are developed by incorporating a mannosylated ionizable lipid to enhance the uptake by DCs through the mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells through the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis to further potentiate the antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Insufficient accumulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based mRNA vaccines in antigen presenting cells remains a key barrier to eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Herein, we develop dendritic cells (DCs) targeting LNPs by taking advantage of mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Efficient delivery of mRNA to DCs is achieved in vitro and in vivo utilizing the sweet LNPs (STLNPs&#8208;Man). Intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccine (STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA) results in a four&#8208;fold higher uptake by DCs in comparison with commercially used LNPs. Benefiting from its DCs targeting ability, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA significantly promotes the antitumor performances, showing a comparable therapeutic efficacy by using one&#8208;fifth of the injection dosage as the vaccine prepared from normal LNPs, thus remarkably avoiding the side effects brought by conventional mRNA vaccines. More intriguingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells due to the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis, showing brilliant potentials in promoting antitumor efficacy combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

         <title>Multifold Post&#8208;Modification of Macrocycles and Cages by Isocyanate&#8208;Induced Azadefluorination Cyclisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents through azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC), which enables multistep supramolecular chemistry using readily available isocyanates, allowing the functionalization of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages&#8242; exterior chemical spaces. With ditopic isocyanates, ADFC can be used to create cross&#8208;linked membranes from supramolecular entities.







Abstract
We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif via an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.

         <dc:description>
What makes a chemistry&#8208;based innovation challenge successful and how can activities for scientific outreach be improved? In this Viewpoint we discuss the Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition that has resonated within the scientific community. Through examining the feedback of the participants, we gain valuable insight and lessons into what makes an open innovation activity successful and what pitfalls to avoid.







Abstract
For five years now, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany has hosted The Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition. When the event kicked off in 2018 on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the company, no one could have predicted the path it would take&#8212;from a novel competition to a pivotal event within the synthetic chemistry community. But what makes the Compound Challenge tick and what drives its popularity? And, more importantly, what lessons can be taken from the Compound Challenge and applied to other challenges in scientific education and outreach? In this Viewpoint Article we will tell the story of the Compound Challenge, from its inception to its current status. Through examining feedback following each of its iterations, we begin to define what makes an open innovation challenge so compelling. It is our hope that educators, leaders, and innovators will be able to learn from our successes as well as our mistakes and apply these lessons to their future outreach activities.

By fully modulating the ICT degree and the AIE property of the solid&#8208;state probes, a colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection strategy is built with boosted response contrast for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP. The proposed probe design strategy would help to open a door for exploring novel probe design methodologies from the aspect of synergistically modulating the molecular structure and the emission behavior.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shows promising performance in chemical sensing relying on the change of the emission behavior of the probe molecule monomers to the aggregated product. However, whether the response contrast could be further boosted by utilizing the emission property of the aggregated probe and the aggregated product remains a big challenge. Here, an exciting AIE probe regulation strategy was proposed by coherently modulating the aggregation behavior and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property of the probes and thus an aggregated&#8208;to&#8208;aggregated colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection was achieved. The blue emissive film obtained with the optimal AIE probe has been proven to be effective to recognize the vapor of nerve agent analog DCP in air by emitting a sharp green fluorescence. In addition, a porous polymer&#8208;based wet sensing chip loaded with the probe enables the immediate response to DCP vapor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7&#8197;ppb, and it was further integrated into a wearable watch device for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP vapor up to two weeks. We expect the present probe design strategy would greatly deepen the AIE&#8208;based science and provide new insights for long&#8208;term monitoring sensors toward trace hazardous substances.

         <title>De Novo Designed Ru(II) Metallacycle as a Microenvironment&#8208;Adaptive Sonosensitizer and Sonocatalyst for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Biofilms Eradication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is proposed to boost the reactive oxygen species&#8208;generation capability, resulting in the development of the first example of a supramolecular sonosensitizer (Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD). Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD effectively overcame challenges posed by the complex biofilm microenvironment, including hypoxia, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and hypopermeability for amplifying sonotherapeutic efficacy in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant biofilms.







Abstract
Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle&#8208;based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD&#8217;s production of ultrasonic&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;&#8208;expansion approach. Within the BME, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple&#8208;modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD sono&#8208;catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.

         <title>Breaking Iron Homeostasis: Iron Capturing Nanocomposites for Combating Bacterial Biofilm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacteria spend years in a dormant, inactive state, yet revive in some nutrient environments. Iron nutritional immunity strategy was proposed to target iron nutrients. We developed a nanoplatform that can deceive bacteria to uptake &#8220;fake iron&#8221; and concurrently extract iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu, starving pathogens to death.







Abstract
Given the scarcity of novel antibiotics, the eradication of bacterial biofilm infections poses formidable challenges. Upon bacterial infection, the host restricts Fe ions, which are crucial for bacterial growth and maintenance. Having coevolved with the host, bacteria developed adaptive pathways like the hemin&#8208;uptake system to avoid iron deficiency. Inspired by this, we propose a novel strategy, termed iron nutritional immunity therapy (INIT), utilizing Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites constructed with gallium, copper&#8208;doped tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) metal&#8211;organic framework, and polyamine&#8208;amine polymer dots, to target bacterial iron intakes and starve them. Owing to the similarity between iron/hemin and gallium/TCPP, gallium&#8208;incorporated porphyrin potentially deceives bacteria into uptaking gallium ions and concurrently extracts iron ions from the surrounding bacteria milieu through the porphyrin ring. This strategy orchestrates a &#8220;give and take&#8221; approach for Ga3+/Fe3+ exchange. Simultaneously, polymer dots can impede bacterial iron metabolism and serve as real&#8208;time fluorescent iron&#8208;sensing probes to continuously monitor dynamic iron restriction status. INIT based on Ga&#8208;CT@P nanocomposites induced long&#8208;term iron starvation, which affected iron&#8208;sulfur cluster biogenesis and carbohydrate metabolism, ultimately facilitating biofilm eradication and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this study presents an innovative antibacterial strategy from a nutritional perspective that sheds light on refractory bacterial infection treatment and its future clinical application.

         <title>12 Connecting Sites Linked Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Non&#8208;interpenetrated shp Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented 12 connecting sites linked three&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with intrinsic non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology have been fabricated and structurally characterized, which show efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O.







Abstract
Developing high connectivity (&gt;8) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards new topologies and functions remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in getting high connectivity organic building blocks. This however represents the most important step towards promoting the diversity of COFs due to the still limited dynamic covalent bonds available for constructing COFs at this stage. Herein, highly connected phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) 3D COFs MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs (M=H2, Ni) were afforded from the reaction between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine M(TAPc) (M=H2, Ni) and 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexayl)hexa(isophthalohydrazide) (THHI) with 12 connecting sites. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis together with theoretical simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveals their crystalline nature with an unprecedented non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology. Experimental and theoretical investigations disclose the broadened visible light absorption range and narrow optical band gap of MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs. This in combination with their 3D nanochannels endows them with efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O via 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm). This work provides valuable result for the development of high connectivity functional COFs towards diverse application potentials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Coupling for Targeted Synthesis of CH3COOH with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity is realized over a catalyst with charge asymmetric metal pair sites, wherein the metal charge asymmetric active sites induced by doping engineering can boost the C&#8722;C coupling of double COOH* intermediates.

         <title>Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Manipulating the Intermolecular Interactions through Side Chain Fluorine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of precisely controlled fluorine atoms into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptors substantially increased the overall average electrostatic potential and charge balance factor. This enhancement improved intermolecular interaction, allowing for precise tuning of molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Fluorine side chain functionalization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) represents an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, a knowledge gap persists regarding the relationship between structural changes induced by fluorine functionalization and the resultant impact on device performance. In this work, varying amounts of fluorine atoms were introduced into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs to construct two acceptors named BTP&#8208;F0 and BTP&#8208;F5. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that side&#8208;chain fluorination significantly increase the overall average electrostatic potential (ESP) and charge balance factor, thereby effectively improving the ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular electrostatic interaction, and thus precisely tuning the molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Therefore, the BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based OSC exhibited enhanced crystallinity, domain purity, reduced domain spacing, and optimized phase distribution in the vertical direction. This facilitates exciton diffusion, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. Consequently, the promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;% were achieved in BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices, respectively, surpassing the PCE of 16.1&#8201;% for BTP&#8208;F0&#8208;based OSCs. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and demonstrates that fluorine functionalization of the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs is a compelling strategy for achieving ideal phase separation for highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Confinement of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore Zeolite for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) was used as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting photocatalytic HI splitting. The superior activity of the composite was the result of exposed active sites, excellent I3&#8722; adsorption and facile molecular/ionic transfer and diffusion, suitable band gap, as well as good stability.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs), renowned for their outstanding optoelectronic properties, hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of catalytically active sites of bulky MHPs seriously impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (3.4&#8197;nm) for boosting hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting. The as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability in acidic media, along with intrinsic extra&#8208;large pores of ZEO&#8208;1 that were favorable for molecule/ion adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO&#8208;1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3) under visible light irradiation compared with bulk CsPbBr3 (11&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), and the long&#8208;term durability (36&#8197;h) can be achieved. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well&#8208;dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO&#8208;1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity (4826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), surpassing most of the Pt&#8208;integrated perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics investigation revealed that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite&#8208;confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>A Hybrid Redox&#8208;Mediated Zinc&#8208;Air Fuel Cell for Scalable and Sustained Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable attention for their high energy density, safety, low noise, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell (HRM&#8208;ZAFC) utilizing 7,8&#8208;dihydroxyphenazine&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation &#64258;exibility and scalability for large&#8208;scale power generation applications. The DHPS&#8208;mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51 W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82 Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Vigorous Iodic Species Triggered by Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode is a promising alternative to Li&#8208;ion systems. However, the sluggish charge transfer of cathode and accumulation of inactive Li on anode remain persistent challenges. An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I2&#8208;LiNO3 additives, I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO3&#8211; and I&#8722; ions. The I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are reactive to insulated Li2S product of cathode and inactive Li on anode, thus accelerating the conversation reaction of sulfur and recovering Li sources back to battery cycling. The in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic and morphologic monitoring reveal the crucial role of iodine in promoting Li2S dissociation and inhibiting dendritic Li growth. With the modified electrolyte, the symmetric Li&#448;&#448;Li cells deliver a lifespan of 4000 h with an overpotential less than 12 mV at 0.5 mA cm&#8211;2. For Li&#8211;S cells, 100% capacity retention up to thousands of cycles and enhanced rate capability are available. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy on electrolyte engineering for practical applications of Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I2-LiNO3 additives, I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO3&#8211; and I&#8722; ions. The I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are reactive to insulated Li2S product of cathode and inactive Li on anode, thus accelerating the conversation reaction of sulfur and recovering Li sources back to battery cycling. The in-situ/ex-situ spectroscopic and morphologic monitoring reveal the crucial role of iodine in promoting Li2S dissociation and inhibiting dendritic Li growth. With the modified electrolyte, the symmetric Li&#448;&#448;Li cells deliver a lifespan of 4000 h with an overpotential less than 12 mV at 0.5 mA cm&#8211;2. For Li&#8211;S cells, 100% capacity retention up to thousands of cycles and enhanced rate capability are available. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy on electrolyte engineering for practical applications of Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Depicting the Chemical Diversity of Bioactive Meroterpenoids Produced by the Largest Organism on Earth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this investigation, we explored the diversity of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids produced by Armillaria ostoyae, one of the largest and oldest organisms on Earth, using extracts from liquid and solid fermentation media. The study unveiled three unprecedented dimeric bismelleolides (1&#8208;3) and three novel fatty acid&#8208;substituted congeners (4&#8208;6), along with 11 new (7&#8208;17) and 21 known (18&#8208;38) derivatives. Structure elucidation was done by 1D&#8208; and 2D&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, HRESI&#8208;MS data, and ROESY spectral analysis for relative configurations. Absolute configurations were determined through crystal structures and ECD spectra comparison. A compound library of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids facilitated metabolomics&#8208;wide associations, revealing production patterns under different culture conditions. The library enabled assessments of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, unveiling that the &#916;2,4 double bond is not crucial for antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity was linked to the presence of an aldehyde at C&#8208;1, but lost with a hydroxylation at C&#8208;13. Chemoinformatic analyses demonstrated the intricate interplay of chemical modifications on biological properties. This study marks the first systematic exploration of Armillaria spp. meroterpenoid diversity via MS&#8208;based untargeted metabolomics, offering insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships through innovative chemoinformatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Topology Controlled All&#8208;(Meth)acrylic Thermoplastic Elastomers by Multi&#8208;Functional Lewis Pair&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to synthesize all&#8208;(meth)acrylic triblock thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), due to the drastically different reactivities between the acrylates and methacrylates and inevitable occurrence of side reactions during polymerization of acrylates. By taking advantage of the easy structural modulation features of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), we design and synthesize strong nucleophilic tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based NHOs varying in the number (i.e. mono&#8208;, dual&#8208; and tetra&#8208;) of initiating functional groups. Its combination with bulky organoaluminum [iBuAl(BHT)2] (BHT = bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy)) constructs Lewis pair (LP) to realize the living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, furnishing polyacrylates with ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn up to 2174 kg&#8231;mol&#8208;1)&#160;within 4 min. Moreover, these NHO&#8208;based LPs enable us not only realize the control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star), but also achieve triblock star copolymers in one&#8208;step manner. Mechanical studies reveal that the star triblock TPEs exhibit better mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 1863% and tensile strength up to 19.1 MPa) in comparison with the linear analogs. Moreover, the presence of tetraphenylethylene group in the NHOs entitled the triblock TPEs with excellent AIE properties in both solution and solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Supported Silver Catalysts through Al modification for Efficient Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;modified catalysts have attracted extraordinary research attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their enhanced geometric and electronic structures and outstanding catalytic performances. Silver (Ag) possesses necessary active sites for ethylene epoxidation, but the catalyst activity is usually sacrificed to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene oxide (EO). Herein, we report that using Al can help in tailoring the unoccupied 3d state of Ag on the MnO2 support through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs), overcoming the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for ethylene epoxidation and resulting in a very high ethylene conversion rate (~100%) with 90% selectivity for EO under mild conditions (170 oC and atmospheric pressure). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSIs obtained by the Al modification tailor the unoccupied 3d state of Ag, modulating the adsorption of ethylene (C2H4) and oxygen (O2) and facilitating EO desorption, resulting in high C2H4 conversion. Meanwhile, the increased number of positively charge Ag+ lowers the energy barrier for C2H4(ads) oxidation to produce oxametallacycle (OMC), inducing the unexpectedly high EO selectivity. Such an extraordinary electronic promotion provides new promising pathways for designing advanced metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarized Ultrathin BN Induced Dynamic Electron Interactions for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing ruthenium&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with an efficient and stable interface is essential for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheet support with relatively independent electron donor and acceptor sites, which serves as an electron reservoir and receiving station for RuO2, realizing the rapid supply and reception of electrons. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a low OER overpotential of only 180 mV (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term operational stability (350 h) are achieved, suggesting potential practical applications. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations have validated the existence of a localized electronic recycling between RuO2 and BNNS. The electron&#8208;rich Ru sites accelerate the adsorption of water molecules and the dissociation of intermediates, while the interconnection between the O&#8208;terminal and B&#8208;terminal edge establishes electronic back&#8208;donation, effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of lattice oxygen. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a stable and highly active catalytic interface.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#160;HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (MASC). In the NOx&#160;reduction performance tests,&#160;Ru0.4(Rh0.33Pd0.33Pt0.33)0.6&#160;MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light&#8208;off temperature decreasing by&#160;ca.&#160;50 &#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#160;MASC was attributable to the well&#8208;coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8208;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Double and Triple Decker Arrangements of Rare&#8208;Earth 9,10&#8208;Diborataanthracene Complexes Featuring Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring a 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene ligand. This 14&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron ligand is highly reductive and was previously used in small&#8208;molecule activation. Salt elimination reactions between dipotassium 9,10&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] (CotTIPS = 1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) in a 1:1 ratio yielded heteroleptic sandwich complexes [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln = Y, Dy, Er). These compounds form Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers when crystallised from toluene. In contrast, reaction of [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] in a 1:2 ratio led to the formation of heteroleptic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln = Y, Dy, Er). Notably, these are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first trivalent lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere. Magnetic investigations reveal that [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln = Dy, Er) and [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)ErIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)ErIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] exhibit Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. In the case of [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln = Dy, Er), the introduction of a second near lanthanide ion results in strong antiferromagnetic interactions, allowing the enhancement of the magnetic characteristic of the system, compared to the quasi isolated counterpart. This research renews the overlooked coordination chemistry of the DBA ligand and expands it to encompass rare&#8208;earth elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining the Generation of Advanced Polymer Materials through the Marriage of Automation and Multiblock Copolymer Synthesis in Emulsion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance&#160;&#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers, which are defined as three or more distinct polymer segments comprising different monomer compositions covalently bonded together in linear sequence.&#160;The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molecular weight multiblock copolymers (typically &gt; 100,000 g mol&#8208;1) using RAFT polymerization in aqueous emulsions. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a high molecular weight multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen&#160;blocks. Libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions, block orders, and block lengths were generated. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward,&#160;representing the way forward to the next generation of&#160;macromolecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Primary Chlorides by&#160;Selective Chlorocarbonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized primary alkyl chlorides are precursors to a plethora of scaffolds but their access from chemical feedstocks remains&#160;challenging. Herein, we report a concise dual Ni/photoredox catalytic protocol for regioselective chlorocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes that enables rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides. The catalytic process features an extensive substrate scope, scalability and functional group tolerance. The Ni/photocatalytic Cl&#8226; generation and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling is implicated for the process based on the control experiments and DFT study. Synthetic utility of the protocol has been further corroborated through functionalization of complex substrates and post&#8208;modifications of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for Enhanced Interfacial Phase Stabilization of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in&#8208;situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+ = ~0.67). Consequently, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt; 99.8% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the SPE and highlights the importance of the ion environment in participating in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8208;3 to 102 S m&#8208;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100 ppm NH3 at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation Hydrogen Bonding in Co&#8208;N/S&#8208;coordination&#8208;framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT=2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) with 2% lattice compression exhibits a superior half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81 V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin&#8208;charge densities around S atoms for Co&#8208;DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Tolerant Superbase Polyoxometalate&#160;[H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722;&#160;for Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, doubly protonated Lindqvist&#8208;type niobium oxide cluster [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211; fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis exhibited superbase catalysis for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions accompanied by activating C&#8211;H bond with pKa &gt;26 and proton abstraction from a base indicator with pKa = 26.5. Surprisingly, [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211; exhibited water&#8208;tolerant superbase properties for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions in the presence of water, although it is well known that the strong basicity of metal oxides and organic superbase is typically lost by the adsorption of water. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the basic surface oxygens that share the corner of NbO6 units in [H2(Nb6O19)]8&#8211; maintained the negative charges even after proton adsorption. This proton capacity and the presence of un&#8208;protonated basic&#160;sites led to the water tolerance of the superbase catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Glutathione Induced In&#8208;situ Synthesis of Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Anaerobic Glycolysis Metabolism Interference for Boosting Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) has sparked increasing interest for catalytic antitumor treatment due to their more tunable and diverse active sites than natural metalloenzymes in complex physiological conditions. However, it is usually a hard task to precisely conduct catalysis at tumor sites after intravenous injection of those SAzyme with high reactivity. Moreover, the explorations of SAzymes in the anticancer application are still in its infancy and need to be developed.&#160;Herein, an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for Cu SAzyme&#160;was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8208;O2/Cu&#8208;O4) via GSH&#8208;responsive deformability of supports. Our results suggest that the in&#8208;situ activation process could further facilitate the dissociation of copper ions and the consumption of glutathione, thereby leading to copper deposition in cytoplasm and triggering cuproptosis. Moreover, the in&#8208;situ synthesis of Cu SAzyme with peroxidase&#8208;like activity enabled the intracellular reactive oxygen species production, resulting in specifically disturbance of copper metabolism pathway. Meanwhile, the in&#8208;situ exposed glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor phloretin (Ph) can block the glycose uptake to boost cuproptosis efficacy. Overall, this in situ activation strategy effectively diminished the off&#8208;target effects of SACs&#8208;induced catalytic therapies and introduced a promising treatment paradigm for advancing cuproptosis&#8208;associated therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry is put forward based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. The reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high&#8208;yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes Embedding Azulene and Stone&#8208;Wales Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations.







Abstract
The incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid motifs in graphene nanostructures significantly impacts their properties, making them attractive for applications in carbon&#8208;based electronics. However, understanding how specific non&#8208;benzenoid structures influence their properties remains limited, and further investigations are needed to fully comprehend their implications. Here, we report an on&#8208;surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor P on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene Aa&#8722;a embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring&#8208;closure of methyl substituents, while Aa&#8722;s contains one azulene unit and one Stone&#8208;Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring&#8208;closure and skeletal ring&#8208;rearrangement reactions. Aa&#8722;a exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non&#8208;benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side&#8208;products with closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;rearragement reactions (Ba&#8722;a, Ba&#8722;s, Bs&#8208;a and Bs&#8722;s). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non&#8208;benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.

Here, we report an on-surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non-benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene &lt;b&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;a&#8722;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring-closure of methyl substituents, while &lt;b&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;a&#8722;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; contains one azulene unit and one Stone-Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring-closure and skeletal ring-rearrangement reactions. &lt;b&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;a&#8722;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non-benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side-products with closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring-closure and ring-rearragement reactions (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;a&#8722;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;a&#8722;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;s-a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;s&#8722;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non-benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation over Bicomponent Catalysts through Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium, which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with copper, which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on palladium at low overpotentials and facilitate palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen transfer and timely desorptive hydrogenation on copper. As a result, a record high alkene production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved over this system at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8&#8201;% at a low energy consumption of 1.26&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60&#8197;h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Steric Hindrance and Excited State for Anti&#8208;Quenching and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation results in high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorophores (IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz) with anti&#8208;quenching behavior and fast spin&#8208;flip. A device based on IDAD&#8208;BNCz with a high doping level of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% shows a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold great promise for advanced high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, persistent challenges, such as severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and slow spin&#8208;flip, hinder their optimal performance. We propose a synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which is demonstrated by two blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz, bearing sterically demanding 8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IDAD) and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (TIDAD), respectively. These rigid and bulky IDAD/TIDAD moieties, with appropriate electron&#8208;donating capabilities, not only effectively mitigate ACQ, ensuring efficient luminescence across a broad range of dopant concentrations, but also induce high&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited states that facilitate triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip without causing undesired emission redshift or spectral broadening. Consequently, implementation of a high doping level of IDAD&#8208;BNCz resulted in highly efficient narrowband electroluminescence, featuring a remarkable full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The combined steric and electronic effects arising from the steric&#8208;hindered donor introduction offer a compelling molecular design strategy to overcome critical challenges in MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Repaired g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets: Elevating the Efficacy of Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Through Enhanced Charge Carrier Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant number of structural defects are the primary factor limiting the catalytic performance of g&#8208;C3N4. Here, a reduction in bulk defects within g&#8208;C3N4 is achieved by optimizing the mass transfer process in the synthesis pathway, resulting in enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) through facilitated charge carrier migration.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has garnered growing interest owing to its high tissue penetration depth and minimal side effects. However, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers remains the primary limiting factor for the clinical application of this treatment method. Here, defect&#8208;repaired graphene phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) nanosheets are prepared and utilized for enhanced SDT in anti&#8208;tumor treatment. After defect engineering optimization, the bulk defects of g&#8208;C3N4 are significantly reduced, resulting in higher crystallinity and exhibiting a polyheptazine imide (PHI) structure. Due to the more extended conjugated structure of PHI, facilitating faster charge transfer on the surface, it exhibits superior SDT performance for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. This work focuses on introducing a novel carbon nitride nanomaterial as a sonosensitizer and a strategy for optimizing sonosensitizer performance by reducing bulk defects.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;function biosensing system based on supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA) and solid&#8208;state nanochannels with hydrophobic partition modification was developed by Yu Huang, Fan Xia et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316434). Based on the disassembly of SSW&#8208;DNA, during the target recognition, the on&#8208;site detection is achieved by introducing fluorescent molecules on SSW&#8208;DNA and using test strips. Since the entire detection system only involves one target identification process, it introduces only one potential error propagation, thereby reducing the overall risk of errors in the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process.

         <title>Dithienoquinoxalineimide&#8208;based Polymer Donor Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new&#8208;emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high&#8208;performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene&#8208;conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl&#8208;thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide bandgap of 1.80 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8208;5.47 eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high&#8208;performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the QQ1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81%. After the introduction of F&#8208;BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all&#8208;PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;yielding active template click reaction (AT&#8208;CuAAC) for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) represent an exciting yet underexplored area of research in the context of carbon nanoscience. Recently, work from our group and others has shown that small carbon nanotube fragments&#8212;[n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related nanohoop macrocycles&#8212;may be integrated into mechanically interlocked architectures by leveraging supramolecular interactions, covalent tethers, or metal&#8208;ion templates. Still, available synthetic methods are typically difficult and low yielding and general methods that allow for the creation of a wide variety of these structures are limited. Here we report an efficient route to interlocked nanohoop structures via the active template Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8208;CuAAC) reaction. With the appropriate choice of substituents, a macrocyclic precursor to 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl embedded [9]CPP (bipy[9]CPP) participates in the AT&#8208;CuAAC reaction to provide [2]rotaxanes in near&#8208;quantitative yield, which can then be converted to the fully p&#8208;conjugated catenane structures. Through this approach two nanohoop[2]catenanes are synthesized which consist of a bipy[9]CPP catenated with either Tz[10]CPP or Tz[12]CPP (where Tz denotes a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety replacing one phenylene ring in the [n]CPP backbone).</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Showing Tautomerism and Colorful Luminescence for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on tautomers has been constructed from triarylamidine bromide salts. The HOF exhibits both structural phase transition and proton transfer tautomerism under external stimulation, accompanied by color&#8208;switching of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The HOF can be used for the highly sensitive and specific detection of acetone.







Abstract
Tautomers coexisting in an equilibrium system have significant potential for regulating luminescent properties because of their structural differences. However, separating and stabilizing tautomers at room temperature is a considerable challenge. In this study, it is found that hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of Br&#8208; anions can effectively separate and stabilize two proton&#8208;transfer tautomers of triarylformamidinium bromide: namely, the nitrogen cation (BA&#8208;N) and carbon cation (BA&#8208;C). The BA&#8208;N crystal consisting of a dense anionic HOF and parallelly aligned organic cations exhibits green thermally activated delayed fluorescence and red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The BA&#8208;C crystal contains acetone molecules that induce an antiparallel arrangement of the organic cations to form a loose HOF, producing blue prompt fluorescence and green RTP. Interestingly, switching of the HOFs between BA&#8208;N and BA&#8208;C can be achieved through the uptake and release of acetone, thereby dynamically adjusting multiple luminescent properties. Consequently, the HOF crystals can be used for the highly sensitive and specific sensing of acetone with a detection limit of 66.74&#8197;ppm. This study not only stabilizes tautomeric luminescent materials at room temperature, but also provides a new method for constructing smart HOFs with a sensitive response to a stimulus.

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain while preserving an excellent recyclability. Remarkably, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material.







Abstract
The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300&#8201;&#176;C. P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.

NaB(CN)4 exhibits a giant negative thermal expansion behaviour (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.24&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) with interesting ultralight mass density properties. Non&#8208;rigid vibrational modes, characterized by a maximum negative Gruneisen parameter, play a key factor in the generation of the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4.







Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) observed in NaB(CN)4, showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low&#8208;frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non&#8208;rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr&#252;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4. This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.

         <title>Site&#8208;Isolated Rhodium(II) Metalloradicals Catalyze Olefin Hydrofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenization of Rh(II) porphyrin catalysts in a metal&#8211;organic framework is crucial for catalyst turnover in thermal olefin hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation. Unlike MOF&#8208;supported metalloradical catalysts, homogeneous analogues convert to closed shell species that obstruct catalytic turnover. Site&#8208;isolated Rh(II) metalloradicals are readily accessed via MOF synthesis with a linker containing a metal&#8208;alkyl bond followed by Rh&#8722;C photolysis.







Abstract
Rh(II) porphyrin complexes display pronounced metal&#8208;centered radical character and the ability to activate small molecules under mild conditions, but catalysis with Rh(II) porphyrins is extremely rare. In addition to facile dimerization, Rh(II) porphyrins readily engage in kinetically and thermodynamically facile reactions involving two Rh(II) centers to generate stable Rh(III)&#8722;X intermediates that obstruct turnover in thermal catalysis. Here we report site isolation of Rh(II) metalloradicals in a MOF host, which not only protects Rh(II) metalloradicals against dimerization, but also allows them to participate in thermal catalysis. Access to PCN&#8208;224 or PCN&#8208;222 in which the porphyrin linkers are fully metalated by Rh(II) in the absence of any accompanying Rh(0) nanoparticles was achieved via the first direct MOF synthesis with a linker containing a transition&#8208;metal alkyl moiety, followed by Rh(III)&#8722;C bond photolysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Rod&#8208;Coil Bottlebrush Copolymers into Degradable Nanodiscs with a UV&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Immolation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymer (BBC) with UV&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative poly(ethyl glyoxylate) side chains are prepared. Through direct self&#8208;assembly such BBC in water, nanoparticles with disc&#8208;like morphologies can be prepared. Upon UV irradiation, these nanodiscs demonstrate controlled degradation and disassembly, transitioning from discs to micelles, and facilitating targeted molecular release.







Abstract
Polymer nanodiscs, especially with stimuli&#8208;responsive features, represent an unexplored frontier in the nanomaterial landscape. Such 2D nanomaterials are considered highly promising for advanced biomedicine applications. Herein, we designed a rod&#8208;coil copolymer architecture based on an amphiphilic, tadpole&#8208;like bottlebrush copolymer, which can directly self&#8208;assemble into core&#8211;shell nanodiscs in an aqueous environment. As the bottlebrush side chains are made of amorphous, UV&#8208;responsive poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) chains, they can undergo rapid end&#8208;to&#8208;end self&#8208;immolation upon light irradiation. This triggered nanodisc disassembly can be used to boost small molecule release from the nanodisc core, which is further aided by a morphological change from discs to spheres.

         <dc:description>
Dipole coupling between catalysts and H2O molecules is utilized to control H2O adsorption and dissociation processes. In their Research Article (e202400119), Yangfan Lu, Qian Li, Fusheng Pan et&#8197;al. showed that the catalyst's dipole moment can be adjusted by modifying the electronegativity gap of utilized elements and realized a systematic control of H2O activation processes. These discoveries offer a catalyst design guideline for the H2O&#8208;associated reactions in addition to the widely cited d&#8208;band center concept.

The nature of adsorbed oxygen species determines the product selectivity in the oxidative coupling of CH4 as shown on the cover. In their Communication (e202319192), Guiyuan Jiang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko et&#8197;al. describe how the formation of carbon oxides and ethane correlates with the binding strength of selective mono&#8208;atomic oxygen species. The strength affects the probability of their recombination to diatomic oxygen species oxidizing methane to carbon oxides. Cover image credit: Vita A. Kondratenko.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes CircularlyPolarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of molecular vibrations on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in double helicenes DPC and DNH is reported by Tadashi Mori in a Research Article (e202319702). Specifically, in DPC (structure depicted in the picture), the study clarifies how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, and it underscores the noteworthy contribution of Herzberg&#8211;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.

         <title>Stabilization of Acenes: &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221;&#8208;Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis, starting from commercially available pentacenetetraone, gives helical, doubly quaterphenylene wrapped pentacenes. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architecture effectively shields the acene backbones&#8212;the para&#8208;quaterphenylene derivative displays unique stability with respect to photoxodiation and Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with PTAD or fullerene.







Abstract
We report soluble tetrakis&#8208;biphenylyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss&#8208;cross&#8208;bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS&#8208;ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the novel metallic heterostructure Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co was prepared and exhibited excellent water splitting performance. This metallic heterostructure enhances the electron transport efficiency and accelerates the reaction rate of water molecules on its surface by optimizing the electronic structure of the heterointerface.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis holds promise for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, yet it encounters challenges like high voltage and limited stability at higher current densities, primarily due to inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;based metallic heterostructure (Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co) is designed for excellent water electrolysis. In operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, increasing the available protons for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface optimizes &#916;GH of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&#8722; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore&#8208;mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58&#8197;V cell voltage at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and maintains 100&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;hours at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer.

         <title>Bifunctional Potential Structure Design Breaks Electrolyte Limitations of Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are safe and economical for grid applications. However, current ZIBs have limitations in terms of inferior capacity and low output voltage, which are hampered by the electrolyte applicability of the Zn2+ hosts. In this study, we propose a novel organic cathode design strategy with a bifunctional potential region. This polymeric Zn2+ host combines the conjugated polyaniline backbone to tune the molecular surface pH and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4 redox couple for high output voltage and capacity. The polyaniline doped with ferricyanide (PAF) electrode exhibits two forms of charge storage in ZIBs: proton&#8208;assisted Zn2+ doping below 1.2 V (mechanism I), and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4&#8208; redox pair above 1.8 V (mechanism II). Density functional theory calculations and in situ pH experiments demonstrated that the H+ doping process of mechanism I forms a localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, providing a favorable reaction environment for mechanism II. The Zn&#8208;polymer battery delivered an outstanding discharge capacity (405.2 mAh g&#8208;1) and high output voltage (1.8 V) in the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. This study provides a new route for enhancing the structural stability of electrodes and overcoming the electrolyte limitations of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonyl Molecules Induced Oriented Lithium Deposition for Long&#8208;Term Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Li+ desolvation, the electrochemical binding ability of TSOH regulates Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. The electron&#8208;rich structure brings lower reduction potential energy and inhibits decomposition of Li salts. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, a &#8216;smooth and dense&#8217; SEI, significantly reducing interface transmission resistance of Li+ ions.







Abstract
Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li+ transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li+ deposition and generates highly crystalline solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high&#8208;performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO2&#8722; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li+ ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li3N, which regulate Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100&#8197;h. Besides, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14&#8197;times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

In dinitrogen (N2) fixation chemistry, bimetallic end&#8208;on bridging N2 complexes M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M can split N2 into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. We describe detailed bonding analyses of {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8211;3) using a combined spectroscopic and computational approach. The focus is to shed light on the electronic structure contribution to their inabilities to split N2.







Abstract
In dinitrogen (N2) fixation chemistry, bimetallic end&#8208;on bridging N2 complexes M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M can split N2 into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8211;3) are incapable to cleave N2, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8722;N bond length of the N2 ligand and the N&#8722;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes 1 and 2 in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand&#8208;mediated two&#8208;center spin transitions, distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In&#8208;depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr&#8208;N2&#8208;Cr bonding in complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward N2 splitting.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)M can split N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sup&gt;0/1+/2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) are incapable to cleave N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8722;N bond length of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ligand and the N&#8722;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand-mediated two-center spin transitions, distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In-depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cr bonding in complexes&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; splitting. The mechanistic understanding is then used to rationalize the disparate reactivity of related 3d M(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Discovering Electrochemistry with an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) embeds chemistry prior knowledge including the Bulter&#8208;Volmer, Nernst and Diffusion equation to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameter simultaneously from sparse experiments. ECINN seamlessly integrates mass transport and BV equation and provides arguably the best Tafel analysis method. This work encourages embedding domain knowledge to realize strong intelligence with sparse data.







Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8211;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi&#8208;task discovery of electrochemistry parameters. We applied the ECINN to voltammetry experiments of 
 and 
redox couples to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameters. Notably, ECINN seamlessly integrated mass transport with BV to analyze the entire voltammogram to infer transfer coefficients directly, so offering a new approach to Tafel analysis by outdating various mass transport correction methods. In addition, ECINN can help discover the nature of electron transfer and is shown to refute incorrect physics if imposed. This work encourages chemists to embed their domain knowledge into machine learning models to start a new paradigm of chemistry&#8208;informed machine learning for better accountability, interpretability, and generalization.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metallacage exhibited strong host&#8208;guest interactions with fullerene derivatives. The complexes could be dissembled by the further addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine to form a more stable coordinated complex. This tunable host&#8208;guest complexation was further employed to generate different types of reactive oxygen species, enabling the highly efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.







Abstract
The development of novel materials for highly efficient and selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications. Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols. Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. The addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6 and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation. Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6 or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent. This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which could promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Staggered Assembly of a Dimeric Au13 Cluster: Impacts on Coupling of Geometric Isomerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first completely staggered configuration of a di&#8208;superatomic Au25 cluster was solved with atomic precision. The significant torsion angle induces changes in electron coupling and complicates the relaxation pathway of electrons in the excited state when compared with the parallel eclipsed configuration.







Abstract
The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. In this study, the structure of the first staggered di&#8208;superatomic Au25&#8208;S was solved using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au25&#8208;S were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au25&#8208;E. From Au25&#8208;E to Au25&#8208;S, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au13 modules. Au25&#8208;S shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7&#8197;ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29&#8197;ps for Au25&#8208;E. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism&#8208;dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function&#8208;specific nanomaterials.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Covalent Organic Framework in the Presence of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;containing&#8208;species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2 was proposed. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from the oxygen reduction reaction could decrease the energy barrier for the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center and thus boost the CO2RR performance.







Abstract
Herein, we propose an oxygen&#8208;containing species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2. A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF), denoted as NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that is composed of the Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) unit with well&#8208;defined Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites and the salen(Co)2 moiety with binuclear Co&#8722;N2O2 sites, is developed and synthesized for enhancing the CO2RR under aerobic condition. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from ORR could decrease the energy barrier of the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center. Besides, the oxygen species axially coordinated Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites can favor in reducing the energy barrier of the intermediate *COOH formation for the CO2RR. Thus, NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF exhibits high oxygen&#8208;tolerant CO2RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O2, which is superior to that in pure CO2 feed gas (FECO=94.8&#8201;%, jCO=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Notably, the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 128.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow&#8208;cell reactor with 0.5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V, which is higher than that in pure CO2 atmosphere (jCO=104.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is worth noting that an excellent FECO of 86.8&#8201;% is still achieved in the presence of 5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V. This work provides an effective strategy to enable the CO2RR under O2 atmosphere by utilizing the *OOH intermediates of ORR to boost CO2 electroreduction.

&lt;p&gt;An oxygen-containing-species coordination strategy to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was proposed. In the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, one of the Co sites in the NiPc-Salen(Co)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from the oxygen reduction reaction could decrease the energy barrier for the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR over the adjacent Co center and thus boost the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we propose an oxygen-containing species coordination strategy to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus, NiPc-Salen(Co)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-COF exhibits high oxygen-tolerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is superior to that in pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feed gas (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=94.8&#8201;%, &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application.  Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8208;O&#8208;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30oC (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1; tLi+ = 0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722;in&#8208;situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44mAh g&#8722;1@1C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2C) and cycling stability at 30oC (LiFePO4:94.65%@200cycles@0.5C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31%@200cycles@0.3C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Orienting Group Directed Cascade Borylation for Efficient One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as Narrowband Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have emerged as very promising emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrowband emission spectra that may find application in high&#8208;definition displays. While considerable research has focused on investigating the properties of these materials, less attention has been placed on their synthetic methodology. Here we developed an efficient synthetic method for 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs, which enables sustainable production of narrowband organic emitting materials. By strategically introducing substituents, such as methyl, tert&#8208;butyl, phenyl, and chloride, at the C5 position of the 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine substrates, we achieved remarkable regioselective borylation in the para&#8208;position of the substituted moiety. This approach facilitated the synthesis of a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs emitters with good yields and exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic method demonstrated excellent scalability for large&#8208;scale production and enabled late&#8208;stage transformation of the borylated products. Mechanistic investigations provided valuable insights into the pivotal roles of electron effect and steric hindrance effect in achieving highly efficient regioselective borylation. Moreover, the outstanding device performance of the synthesized compounds 10b and 6z, underscores the practicality and significance of the developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt; 100 examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25 meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8211;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4% at 400 nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.</dc:description>

With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4% at 400 nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6 mmol h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32% for urea production at &#8722;0.40 V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2 times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8208;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8211;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc ion Batteries: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) exhibit significant promise in the next generation of grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their safety, relatively high volumetric energy density, and low production cost. Despite substantial advancements in ZIBs, a comprehensive evaluation of critical parameters impacting their practical energy density (Epractical) and calendar life is lacking. Hence, we suggest using formulation&#8208;based study as a scientific tool to accurately calculate the cell&#8208;level energy density and predict the cycling life of ZIBs. By combining all key battery parameters, such as the capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P), into one formula, we assess their impact on Epractical. When all parameters are optimized, we urge to achieve the theoretical capacity for a high Epractical. Furthermore, we propose a formulation that correlates the N/P and Coulombic efficiency of ZIBs for predicting their calendar life. Finally, we offer a comprehensive overview of current advancements in ZIBs, covering cathode and anode, along with practical evaluations. This Minireview outlines specific goals, suggests future research directions, and sketches prospects for designing efficient and high&#8208;performing ZIBs. It aims at bridging the gap from academia to industry for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies.&#160; In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates via supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Triply Selective &amp; Sequential Diversification at Csp3: Expansion of Alkyl Germane Reactivity for C&#8208;C &amp; C&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8208;Cl and Csp3&#8208;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8208;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8208;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8722;solid&#8722;state Li&#8722;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8722;doped, cation&#8722;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8722;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8722;salt&#8722;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5 V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8722;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5 V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8722;based ASSBs at high voltages.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Giant Molecule Acceptors Featuring N&#8208;type Linker: Enhancing Intramolecular Coupling for High&#8208;Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) are typically designed through the conjugated linking of individual small molecule acceptors (SMAs). This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Different from previous reports utilizing&#160;p&#8208;type linkers, here, we explore an&#160;n&#8208;type linker, to dimerize the SMA units via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation, affording&#160;BT&#8208;DL. In comparison with&#160;B&#8208;DL&#160;with a benzene linkage,&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;exhibits significantly stronger intermolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore,&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with&#160;B&#8208;DL&#160;as the acceptor. Notably, the&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000 hours of thermal stress at 90 &#176;C. This work highlight their potential advantage of n&#8208;type linker&#8208;dimerized GMAs in enhancing intermolecular coupling for more efficient and durable devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 V and a mass activity of 0.32 A mg&#8211;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By yielding a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic termination, the surfactant can endow resultant emulsions favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation Catalytic Enantioselective Nucleophilic Desymmetrization at P(V): Improved Generality, Efficiency and Modularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broadly improved second generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched precursors. A new ureidopeptide BIMP catalyst/thiaziolidinone leaving group combination allowed for a far wider substrate scope and increased reaction efficiency and practicality over previously established protocols. The resulting enantioenriched intermediates could then be transformed into an even greater range of distinct classes of P(V) compounds by displacement of the remaining leaving group as well as allowing for even further diversification downstream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to pinpoint the origin of enantioselectivity for the BIMP&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization, to rationalize how a superior catalyst/leaving group combination leads to increased generality in our second&#8208;generation catalytic system, as well as to shed light onto observed retention and inversion pathways when performing late&#8208;stage enantiospecific SN2@P reactions with Grignard reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Tethered Trimeric Small&#8208;molecular Acceptors through Aromatic&#8208;core engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, meta&#8208;isomerization was conducted on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core to precisely regulate the geometry of tethered dimeric acceptors, revealing a more advantageous molecular packing for the meta&#8208;positioned dimers. This finding led to the design of a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned trimer, demonstrating enhanced device stability and performance.







Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA&#8208;subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core and find that meta&#8208;positioned dimeric BDY&#8208;&#946; exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para&#8208;positioned counterpart, BDY&#8208;&#945;. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;, maintaining a meta&#8208;position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24&#8201;%, coupled with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1200&#8197;h thermal degradation. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of tethered trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value in PSCs, simultaneously improving in device efficiency and thermal stability.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500&#8197;Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Fe(CN)6] vacancies regulation is proposed to achieve high specific capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). And then a novel precipitation conversion synthesis method was designed. The as&#8208;prepared PBAs with hierarchical hollow morphology and [Fe(CN)6] vacancies have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh energy density.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).

Programmable DNA motors with tunable properties. The 0&#8201;% GC is the fastest motor and can detect and stall in the presence of single oligonucleotides.







Abstract
DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0&#8201;% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150&#8197;nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0&#8201;% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has been achieved for the first time by the use of half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts with different metals, providing an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of the multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily available aldimines and alkenes.







Abstract
The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2&#8208;methyl aromatic aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C5Me4SiMe3 or C5Me5 exclusively afforded the trans&#8208;selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the cis&#8208;selective annulation products. This protocol features 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments and the isolation and transformations of some key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic molecular catalysts with different coordination environments were synthesized to enhance electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) for efficient ammonia (NH3) production. The best catalyst with N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration exhibited superior activity, achieving over 94&#8201;% NH3 Faradaic efficiency. The research highlights the impact of coordinating subunits on the electronic structures and activity towards eNO3RR and establishes a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90&#8201;% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94&#8201;% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of 11.28&#8197;mg&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28&#8197;s&#8722;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.

         <title>Integrating Olefin Carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag Reaction by Radical Deconstruction of Hydrazonyl N&#8208;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8208;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N2&#8208;retention and N2&#8208;removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N2&#8208;moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8208;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction by the reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino&#8208;N migration and H&#8208;atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#949;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8208;C bond and dual C&#8208;N bonds forging.</dc:description>

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic helical p&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has achieved an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) typically hovering around 1 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficiency CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence peaking at 578 nm with high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as emitter show maximum EQE of 35.5%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48 nm, and more importantly, a high |gEL| of 6.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE &#215; gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrastable Supramolecular Framework Based on Consecutive Side&#8208;by&#8208;Side Hydrogen Bonds for One&#8208;Step C2H4 / C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step efficient separation of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H4 / C2H6 mixtures by HOFs faces two problems: lack of strategies for constructing stable pores in HOFs and how to obtain high C2H6 selectivity. Herein, we have developed a microporous Mortise&#8208;Tenon&#8208;type HOF (MTHOF&#8208;1, MT is short for Mortise&#8208;Tenon structure) with a new self&#8208;assembly mode for C2H4 / C2H6 separation. Unlike previous HOFs which usually possess discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head hydrogen bonds, MTHOF&#8208;1 is assembled by a unique consecutive side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bonds, which result in mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon pores decorated with orderly arranged amide groups and benzene rings. As expected, MTHOF&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability under various conditions and shows obvious separation trends for C2H6 / C2H4. The IAST selectivity is as high as 2.15 at 298 K. More importantly, dynamic breakthrough experiments have demonstrated that MTHOF&#8208;1 can effectively separate the C2H6 / C2H4 feed gas to obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 in one step even under high&#8208;humidity conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;mediated Interfacial Growth of 2D&#8208;2D Heterostructured Nanomaterials as Cathodes for Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross&#8208;linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self&#8208;stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8208;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8208;Ni4Co1//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8208;Ni4Co1//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61 mAh cm&#8722;2, maintaining 96.6% capacitance after 2300 cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 32.899 mW cm&#8722;2. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy&#8208;related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Heterometal&#8208;Organic Capsules for Selectively Encapsulating Tetrahedral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic modification plays a crucial role in precisely adjusting the structure and functions of advanced materials. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a tubular heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule, incorporating Pd(II) and CuL1 metalloligands. This capsule undergoes further modification with two tridentate anionic ligands (L2) resulting in a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule with an Edshammer polyhedral structure. By employing transition metal ions, acid, and oxidation agents, the bicapped capsule is convertible to an uncapped one. This uncapped form can then revert to the bicapped structure with the addition of Br&#8208; ions and a base. Interestingly, introducing Ag+ leads to the removal of one L2 ligand from the bicapped capsule, yielding a mono&#8208;capped Pd3Cu6L16L2 structure. Furthermore, the size of anions critically influences the precisely controlling the post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the capsules. It was demonstrated that these capsules selectively encapsulate the tetrahedral anions, offering a novel approach in the design of intelligent molecular delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;migration is one recurring isomerization reaction in organic chemistry. In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe2&#160;(1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5). Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25 equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).</dc:description>

Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25 equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antenna Effect in Noble Metal&#8208;Free Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Systems Enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems by utilizing noble metal&#8208;free photosensitizer (zinc&#8208;porphyrin) and catalyst (cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine) derivatives. Upon introducing an additional chromophore (Bodipy), an antenna effect enhanced the photoproduction leading to 42.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of CO and 759 turn over numbers.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, their application in carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction remains limited. Furthermore, current solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs typically employ rhenium complexes as catalysts. In this study, we have developed DSPs that incorporate noble metal&#8208;free components, specifically a zinc&#8208;porphyrin as photosensitizer (PS) and a cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine as catalyst (CAT). Taking a significant stride forward, we have achieved an antenna effect for the first time in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs by introducing a Bodipy as an additional chromophore to enhance light harvesting efficiency. The energy transfer from Bodipy to zinc porphyrin resulted in remarkable stability (turn over number (TON)=759 vs. CAT), and high CO evolution activity (42&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 vs. CAT).

         <title>A Polymeric Nanoparticle to Co&#8208;Deliver Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Peptides and Pt(IV) Prodrug: Toward High Loading Efficiency and Combination Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria&#8208;targeting peptide can inhibit ATP&#8208;dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt&#8208;drugs within cancer cells. Eventually, the polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model. It is highly anticipated that the polymeric dual&#8208;or multi&#8208;drug systems can be applied for combination chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer activity and reduced side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering Photoelectronic and Photothermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively disentangles the photoelectronic (PE) and photothermal (PT) effects in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis using CO2RR on Ag NPs electrode as the model system. The PE effect prevails over a wide potential window for the CO2RR to CO, while the PT effect dominates the H2 evolution reaction at high overpotentials. It is revealed spectroscopically that the carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate applies to the plasmon&#8208;promoted CO2RR to CO process.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis that rests on the ability of coupling localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and electrochemical activation, emerges as an intriguing and booming area. However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE) and partial current density (100&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon&#8208;promoted formation of the bridge&#8208;bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate. The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potassium silole salt reacts with erbium or yttrium cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl half&#8208;sandwich complexdx via insertion of a silole silicon atom into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. Analogous reactions involving a potassium germole salt reveal intact transfer of the germole to the rare&#8208;earth element, giving germole&#8208;ligated coordination polymers. The erbium are single&#8208;molecule magnets, and one example is characterized using high&#8208;frequency AC susceptometry.







Abstract
The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M=Er, Y; COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K]&#8734; (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8722; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)K]&#8734; (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106&#8197;Hz.

         <title>Selective Construction and Structural Transformation of Homogeneous Linear Metalla[4]catenane and Metalla[2]catenane Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane consisting of four linked rings was obtained in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear Cp*Rh&#8208;based precursor.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules has been extensively researched, selectively constructing homogeneous linear [4]catenanes remains a formidable challenge. Here, we selectively constructed a homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear half&#8208;sandwich rhodium precursor. The formation of metalla[4]catenanes was facilitated by cooperative interactions between strong sandwich&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds between the components. Moreover, by modulating the aromatic substituents on the binuclear precursor, two homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes were obtained. The molecular structures of these metallacatenanes were unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, reversible structural transformation between metal&#8208;catenanes and the corresponding metallarectangles could be achieved by altering their concentration, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy studies.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spidroin&#8208;derived modular proteins have been designed and the fabricated fibers demonstrate a toughness of up to 200&#8197;MJ/m3, achieving the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. By co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch stability have been improved significantly.







Abstract
Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double cored vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes opening new direction to SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Precursors to Replicator Assemblies Can Improve Replication Fidelity and Mediate Error Correction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copying information is vital for life's propagation. Current life forms maintain a low error rate in replication, using complex machinery to prevent and correct errors. However, primitive life had to deal with higher error rates, limiting its ability to evolve. Discovering mechanisms to reduce errors would alleviate this constraint. Here, we introduce a new mechanism that decreases error rates and corrects errors in synthetic self&#8208;replicating systems driven by self&#8208;assembly. Previous work showed that macrocycle replication occurs through the accumulation of precursor material on the sides of the fibrous replicator assemblies. Stochastic simulations now reveal that selective precursor binding to the fiber surface enhances replication fidelity and error correction. Centrifugation experiments show that replicator fibers can exhibit the necessary selectivity in precursor binding. Our results suggest that synthetic replicator systems are more evolvable than previously thought, encouraging further evolution&#8208;focused experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization control of perovskite thin films is the key in commerciallization of perovskite solar cells. However, the fast crystallization of the thin film including nucleation, growth and Oswald ripening, is still a mystery though some efforts made. According to the theories of nucleation and Oswald ripening, we modified the perovskite surface energy and improved the grain solubility, and quantified the nucleation and ripening rate in experiments. These quantified parameters will facilitate the model building in perovskite crystallization for further industry production.Finally, the optimized films were applied in solar cells to improve efficiency from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;% with VOC of 1.175&#8197;V and FF of 83.53. Furthermore, the excellent ambient stability, light stability and thermal stability are obtained. This work paves the way for controls on overall crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, including nucleation, growth and ripening.







Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9&#8197;mN/m to 36.1&#8197;mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 4.61&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 800&#8197;h aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu porphyrins with fine&#8208;tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal CuI species to a formal Cu0 species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.







Abstract
The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin 1, we synthesized analogues 2&#8211;4 with one or two &#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a cis or trans configuration. Complexes 1&#8211;4 have the same Cu&#8208;N4 core site but different electronic structures. Although &#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, 1&#8211;4 displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI species for 1 to a Cu0 species for 4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeled single&#8208;entity heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized to investigate their cellular distribution, involvement with the immune system, and biodistribution. A fluorescently labeled HS mimetic was observed in the brain of mice and was shown to preferentially associate with immune cells from the tumor site rather than from the spleen. The compounds reported represent a new tool box helping to unravel the mechanism of action of HS mimetics.







Abstract
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. To address this, a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5&#8197;mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic entered the central nervous system and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24&#8197;hours after treatment. Here, we report the enabling methodology for rapidly preparing various labeled HS mimetics and molecular probes with diverse potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Molecular and Structural Basis for C&#947;&#8722;C Bond Formation by PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Fub7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fub7, a pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme, catalyzes stereoselective and substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective C&#947;&#8722;C bond formations. Now a structural and enzymological study have elucidated the structural and molecular underpinnings of its catalytic specificity and selectivity, paving the way for harnessing its activity in the synthesis of cyclic noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of alkyl&#8208; substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of pipecolic acid derivatives. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of structural information hampers their extensive application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of Fub7 by employing ketone&#8208;derived enolates as carbon nucleophiles, revealing Fub7&#8217;s capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer a detailed mechanistic insight into Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.

         <title>A Boron Scan of Ethyl Acetoacetate Leads to Versatile Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.
