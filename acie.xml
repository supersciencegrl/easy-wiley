         <title>Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual&#8208;Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/AFt&#8208;Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced systemic immune response.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Group Metal High&#8208;Entropy Selenides for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selenides of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) are emerging as promising catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions. To date, most studies have focused on single metal or bimetallic systems, whereas the preparation of a high&#8208;entropy (HE) selenide consisting of five or more PGM elements holds the promise to further enhance catalytic performance by introducing abundant active sites with various local coordination environments and electronic structures. Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of PGM&#8208;based HE&#8208;Selenide (HE&#8208;Se) nanoparticles with a unique amorphous structure. The atomic metal&#8211;Se coordination and the presence of short&#8208;range order were thoroughly revealed. It is further shown that the amorphous HE&#8208;Se can be facilely transformed into a single&#8208;phase crystalline HE&#8208;Se with a cubic structure by thermal annealing. Catalytically, the amorphous HE&#8208;Se showed better acidic hydrogen evolution activity over monometallic PGM&#8208;based selenides and the crystalline counterpart, demonstrating the advantages of high&#8208;entropy configuration and amorphous structure. Our findings may pave the way toward the synthesis and property exploration of amorphous PGM&#8208;based selenides with tunable compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Modulated Short&#8208;Chain Cathode for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) due to high theoretical energy density and exceptional safety are highly desirable for electric aircraft. However, as the flight altitude rises, the low&#8208;temperature performance is hampered by inadequate practical capacity. Here, we discover that low&#8208;temperature sulfur utilization is constrained by the multi&#8208;step endothermic conversion reaction. By introducing multi&#8208;chalcogen to modulate the local entropy, a short&#8208;chain molecule cathode is designed to shorten the reduction pathways and enhance low&#8208;temperature discharge capacity. Furthermore, the mismatched lithiation lattice of the short&#8208;chain cathode reduces the decomposition energy barriers, thus enhancing low&#8208;temperature charge/discharge reversibility. The designed short&#8208;chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4%) and cycling stability (400 cycles, 92.2% retention) at room temperature, as well as delivers excellent discharge capacity (579.6 mAh g&#8208;1, &#8208;40 &#176;C) and cycling performance (100 cycles, 98.4% retention, 394.9 Wh kg&#8208;1electrode, &#8208;20 &#176;C) at low temperature. This study presents new opportunities to stimulate the development of low&#8208;temperature ASSLSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise One&#8208;Shot Borylation Reactions for Intersecting DABNA Substructures Exhibiting Bright Yellow&#8210;Green Electroluminescence with EQE Beyond 40% and Mild Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron/nitrogen (B/N)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the multiple resonance (MR) effect are promising for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of their narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Nevertheless, exploring the variety of such emitters is challenging because of the tricky and limited synthetic protocols. Herein, we designed a novel B/N&#8208;doped PAH, L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1, whose backbone (L&#8208;DABNA) could not be achieved via conventional routes (e.g., one&#8208;pot borylation or one&#8208;shot borylation). We successfully synthesized it through stepwise one&#8208;shot borylations with precisely introducing decorations. The unique MR backbone with intersecting DABNA substructures sharing an aniline group, avoiding any para&#8208;N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, allows L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1 to maintain narrowband TADF emission while significantly redshifting to the yellow&#8211;green region with a reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.28 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1. An L&#8208;DABNA&#8208;1&#8208;based OLED device achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% and maintained a high EQE of 36.3% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, with a current efficiency reaching ~170 cd A&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrated the great potential of stepwise borylations in synthesizing B/N&#8208;doped PAH backbones, expanding their chemical space, but also provided a promising pathway for exploring MR&#8208;TADF emitters at longer wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Energy&#8208;Level Reorganization for Efficient Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for &#947;&#8208;ray&#160;spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217;leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44 nA cm&#8208;2. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9% for 22Na 511 keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field&#160;for over 300 minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The selective synthesis of valuable azo&#8208; and azoxyaromatic chemicals via transfer coupling of nitroaromatic compounds has been achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the catalyst structure. Here, a direct method to modulate nitrobenzene reduction and selectively alter the product from azobenzene to azoxybenzene by employing the size effect of Au is reported. Au nanoclusters (NCs) with smaller sizes embedded in ZIF&#8208;8 controllably converted nitrobenzene into azoxybenzene, while supported Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;catalyzed nitrobenzene reduction to azobenzene. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy on CO adsorption (CO&#8208;DRIFTS) of Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 revealed a higher valence state and a lower electron density of Au than that of Au NP/ZIF&#8208;8, combined with the desorption of azoxybenzene from the Au NC and Au NP surface, suggesting that the Au NCs with lower electron density exhibit stronger adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge density difference maps indicated that azoxybenzene bonded to Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 with greater adsorption energy, resulting in more electron transfer between azoxybenzene and the generated Au sites, which inhibited further reduction of azoxybenzene and resulted in high azoxybenzene selectivity. The application of the size effect of Au particles to regulate nitrobenzene transfer coupling provided new insights into the structure&#8208;selectivity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoregular Poly(Phenyl Glycidyl Ethers): In Situ Formation of a Polyether Stereocomplex from a Racemic Monomer Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer stereocomplex formation represents a promising research area as it can improve thermal and mechanical properties of co&#8208;crystallized polymer strands of opposite chirality. Polymers that form stereocomplexes commonly feature high stereoregularity and usually require sourcing from enantiopure monomer building blocks. Herein, we report the in situ polyether stereo&#173;complex formation from racemic epoxide monomers, i.e., substituted methyl phenyl glycidyl ethers. The bio&#8208;renewable glycidyl ethers were explored in both enantio&#8208; and isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (ROPs), resulting in isotactic poly(phenyl glycidyl ether). While the enantio&#173;selective ROP selectively resolves a single enantiomeric, isotactic polyether stereoisomer ([mm]P &#8805; 78%), the isoselective ROP leads to the concurrent formation of both isotactic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;poly(phenyl glycidyl ether) stereoisomers ([mm]P &#8805; 92%) and thus results directly in a stereoisomer blend, which forms a stereocomplex. This is one of only a few polymer stereocomplexes generated directly during polymerization from a racemic monomer mixture. Stereo&#173;complexes of the different poly(phenyl glycidyl ether)s show an increase in melting temperature of up to 76 &#176;C, relative to the enantiopure parent polymers. The position of the methyl group at the phenyl ring determines both stereocomplex formation and the thermal properties of the resulting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Photoreduction of Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 into CH3COOH over Palladium Particles on Nb2O5 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The endeavor to drive CO2 photoreduction towards the synthesis of C2 products is largely thwarted by the colossal energy hurdle inherent in C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we load active metal particles on metal oxide nanosheets to build the dual metal pair sites for steering C&#8722;C coupling to form C2 products. Taking Pd particles anchored on the Nb2O5 nanosheets as an example, the high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate the presence of Pd&#8722;Nb metal pair sites on the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal these sites exhibit a low reaction energy barrier of only 1.02 eV for C&#8722;C coupling, implying that the introduction of Pd particles effectively tailors the reaction step to form C2 products. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets achieve a CH3COOH evolution rate of 13.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in photoreduction of atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2, outshining all other single photocatalysts reported to date under analogous conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Catalytic Metal Nodes within a Single&#8208;Crystalline Pyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline and robust pyrazolate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Pz&#8208;MOFs) capable of facilitating challenging organic transformations is fundamentally significant in catalysis. Here we demonstrate a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy by synthesizing a single&#8208;crystalline and robust Pz&#8208;MOF (PCN&#8208;1004). PCN&#8208;1004 features one&#8208;dimensional (1D) copper&#8208;Pz chains interconnected by well&#8208;organized ligands, forming a porous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network with two types of 1D open channels. Notably, PCN&#8208;1004 displays exceptional stability in aqueous solutions across a broad pH range (1 to 14), attributed to the robust copper&#8208;Pz coordination bonds. Significantly, PCN&#8208;1004 functions as an outstanding catalyst in cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions for constructing C&#8208;O/C&#8208;S bonds, even in the absence of directing groups, achieving yields of up to ~99%, with long cycle lives and high substrate compatibility. PCN&#8208;1004 outperforms all previously reported porphyrin&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Control experiments and computations elucidate the pivotal catalytic role of the copper&#8208;Pz chains and reveal a free radical pathway for the reaction. This work not only demonstrates the successful implementation of a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy for the efficient catalysis of challenging organic transformations but also highlights the synergistic effect of a robust framework, 1D open channels, and active sites in enhancing catalytic efficiency within MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Organic p&#8208;n Junctions in Photoelectrodes for Solar Ammonia Production with 86% Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For photoelectrocatalytic cells, a limitation exists in finding appropriate photoelectrode configurations that couple efficient extraction of high&#8208;energy electrons from absorbed photons and selective catalysis. Here we report an organic p&#8208;n junction approach to fabricate molecular photoelectrodes for conversion of solar energy and nitrate into valuable ammonia product. Solar irradiation of the photoelectrode generates charge&#8208;separated states with electrons and holes spatially separated at the n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type components, as revealed by surface photovoltage mapping, at a quantum yield of 90%. The high&#8208;flux photogenerated electrons are rapidly transferred to the catalyst for solar ammonia production from nitrate reduction at an external quantum efficiency (EQE) and an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 57% and 86%, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the large IQE originates from the combined high efficiencies for photoelectron generation, catalyst activation and dark catalysis. In a flow&#8208;cell setup coupled with a silicon solar cell, the photoelectrode without bias generates photocurrent of 57 mA cm&#8208;2 and ammonia at an EQE of 52%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C3&#8208;Functionalized Indoles via Radical Annulation of Nitroarenes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidatively generated phosphine radical cations are reactive intermediates that can be used for the generation of carbon and heteroatom centered radicals via deoxygenation processes. Such P&#8208;radical cations can readily be generated via single electron transfer oxidation using a redox catalyst. Cheap and commercially available nitroarenes are ideal nitrogen sources for the construction of organic amines and N&#8208;containing heterocycles. Activation of nitroarenes with phosphines has been achieved in the ionic mode, which requires specially designed P&#8208;nucleophiles and high temperatures. Herein, we report an alternative mode of nitro activation that proceeds via a radical process. The radical strategy leads to open shell intermediates that show interesting unexplored reactivity. This is documented by the development of an economic and highly efficient synthesis of valuable indole derivatives through photocatalytic PPh3&#8208;mediated annulation of nitroarenes with alkenes showing large functional group tolerance. The method allows room&#8208;temperature activation of nitroarenes and a double C&#8208;H bond functionalization of alkenes is achieved to provide rapid access to C3&#8208;functionalized indoles, which are key structural components of diverse natural and drug molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies that are further supported by DFT calculations indicate that a nitrosoarene radical cation plays a key role in the annulation process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), whose structure exhibits weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions between 5&#8208;atom thick layers, was subjected to liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) in N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to yield a suspension of nanosheets that were separated into several fractions by successive centrifugation at different speeds. Electron microscopy confirmed successful exfoliation of bulk FGT to nanosheets as thin as 6 nm. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature for the nanosheets gradually decreased with the increase in the centrifugation speed used to isolate the 2D material. These nanosheets were resuspended in NMP and treated with an organic acceptor, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;quinodimethane (TCNQ), which led to precipitation of FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The formation of the composite material is accompanied by charge transfer from the FGT nanosheets to TCNQ molecules, generating TCNQ&#8226;&#8211; radical anions, as revealed by experimental vibrational spectra and supported by first principles calculations. Remarkably, a substantial increase in magnetic anisotropy was observed, as manifested by the increase in the coercive field from nearly zero in bulk FGT to 1.0 kOe in the exfoliated nanosheets and then to 5.4&#160;kOe in the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The dramatic increase in coercivity of the composite suggests that functionalization with redox&#8208;active molecules provides an appealing pathway to enhancing magnetic properties of 2D materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacially Fabricated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Film&#8208;based Fluorescence Humidity Sensors and Moisture Driven Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid, on&#8208;site measurement of ppm&#8208;level humidity in real time remains a challenge. In this work, we fabricated a few micrometer thick, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) membrane via interfacially confined condensation of 1,3,5&#8208;tris&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)triazine (TTA) with 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;formylphloroglucinol (TP). Based on the super&#8208;sensitive and reversible response of the COF membrane to water vapor, we developed a high&#8208;performance film&#8208;based fluorescence humidity sensor, depicting unprecedented detection limit of 0.005 ppm, fast response/recovery (2.2 s/2.0 s), and a detection range from 0.005 to 100 ppm. Remarkably, more than 7,000&#8208;time continuous tests showed no observable change in the performance of the sensor. The applicability of the sensor was verified by on&#8208;site and real&#8208;time monitoring of humidity in a glovebox. The superior performance of the sensor was ascribed to the highly porous structure and unique affinity of the COF membrane to water molecules as they enable fast mass transfer and efficient utilization of the water binding sites. Moreover, based on the remarkable moisture driven deformation of the COF membrane and its composition with the known polyimide films, some conceptual actuators were created. This study brings new ideas to the design of ultra&#8208;sensitive film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors (FFSs) and high&#8208;performance actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synergic Stabilization of High Br&#8208;Content Mixed&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Durable Multi&#8208;Terminal Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Pb Leakage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High Br&#8208;content mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) of 1.6&#8208;2.0 eV have showcased vast potential to be used in tandem solar cells. However, they often suffer from severe halide segregation, phase separation and ion migration issues, which would accelerate the decomposition of perovskites films,&#160;deteriorate the photovoltaic performance and even aggravate the lead leakage from damaged devices. Here, we report a novel chemical synergic interaction strategy to mitigate the abovementioned issues. A small amount of cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, composed of multiple ammonium cations, chlorine ions and abundant hydroxyl functional groups, was introduced into WBG perovskites, which effectively stabilized the halide ions and homogenized the phase distribution, comprehensively passivated the defects,and efficiently immobilized the Pb2+ ions. Encouragingly, the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was universal and useful for different WBG perovskites, which favorably boosted the efficiencies by 10%&#8208;36% and extended the device operational stability to 2680 h. The integrated four&#8208;terminal or&#160;six&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells exhibited efficiencies up to 24.39% and 22.42%, respectively. We demonstrated the cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted internal chemical encapsulation effectively prevented the Pb leakage from severely damaged devices with only 5.63 ppb Pb leaching out. The target tandem solar cells with cationic &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modification also realized a Pb sequestration efficiency of 93.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron Cluster Anions Dissolve en masse in Lipids Causing Membrane Expansion and Thinning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron clusters are applied in medicinal chemistry because of their high stability in biological environments and&#160;intrinsic ability to capture neutrons. However, their intermolecular interactions with lipid membranes, which is critical for their cellular delivery and biocompatibility, have not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we combine different experimental methods &#8211; Langmuir monolayer isotherms at the air&#8208;water interface, calorimetry (DSC, ITC), and scattering techniques (DLS, SAXS) &#8211; with MD simulations to evaluate the impact of closo&#8208;dodecaborate clusters on model membranes of different lipid composition. The cluster anions interact strongly with zwitterionic membranes (POPC and DPPC) via the chaotropic effect and cause pronounced expansions of lipid monolayers. The resulting lipid membranes contain up to 33 mol% and up to 52 weight% of boron cluster anions even at low aqueous cluster concentrations (1 mM). They show high (&#956;M) affinity to the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interface, affecting the structuring of the lipid chains, and triggering a sequence of characteristic effects: (i) an expansion of the surface area per lipid, (ii) an increase in membrane fluidity, and (iii) a reduction of bilayer thickness. These results aid the design of boron cluster derivatives as auxiliaries in drug design and&#160;transmembrane carriers and help rationalize potential toxicity effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Wet Chemistry for the Fast Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Graphyne and its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Graphyne (GY), an emerging carbon allotrope, is envisioned to offer various alluring properties and broad applicability. While significant progress has been made in the synthesis of GY over recent decades, its widespread application hinges on developing efficient, scalable, and accessible synthetic methods for the production of GY and its derivatives. Here we report a facile metal&#8208;free nucleophilic crosslinking method using wet chemistry for fast gram&#8208;scale production of GY and its derivatives. This synthesis method involves the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions between fluoro&#8208;(hetero)arenes and alkynyl silanes in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium fluoride, where the fluoride plays a crucial role in removing protective groups from alkynyl silanes and generating reactive alkynylides. Our comprehensive analysis of the as&#8208;prepared GY reveals a layered structure, characterized by the presence of the C(sp)&#8208;C(sp2) bond. The synthetic strategy shows remarkable tolerance to various functional groups and enables the preparation of diverse F&#8208;/N&#8208;rich GY derivatives, using electron&#8208;deficient fluoro&#8208;substituted (hetero)arenes as precursors. The feasibility of producing GY and derivatives from fluorinated (hetero)arenes through the metal&#8208;free, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective approach paves the way for broad applications of GY and may inspire the development of new carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Multiple Redox&#8208;Active Units into Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high conductivity and reversible redox activity is the key to improving their performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we report a series of COFs (FPDC&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF, FPDC&#8208;TPB&#8208;COF, and FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF) based on an organosulfur linker, (trioxocyclohexane&#8208;triylidene)tris(dithiole&#8208;diylylidene))hexabenzaldehyde (FPDC). These COFs feature two&#8208;dimensional crystalline structures, high porosity, good conductivity, and densely packed redox&#8208;active sites, making them suitable for energy storage devices. Among them, FPDC&#8208;TPT&#8208;COF demonstrates a remarkably high specific capacity of 420 mAh g&#8722;1 (0.2 A g&#8722;1), excellent cycling stability (~87% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, 1.0 A g&#8722;1) and high rate performance (339 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1) as an anode for SIBs, surpassing most reported COF&#8208;based electrodes. The superior performance is attributed to the dithiole moieties enhancing the conductivity and the presence of redox&#8208;active carbonyl, imine, and triazine sites facilitating Na storage. Furthermore, the sodiation mechanism was elucidated through in&#8208;situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work highlights the advantages of integrating multiple functional groups into redox&#8208;active COFs for the rational design of efficient and stable SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrolytic Depolymerization of Polyolefins Catalysed by Zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective UiO&#8208;66, a Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalyst, overcomes limitations in plastic waste depolymerization. During pyrolysis at 400&#8201;&#176;C, it promotes conversion of polyolefins to useful liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons, reducing solid wax formation. This approach also offers a distinct catalytic pathway compared to conventional zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
Polyolefins such as polyethylenes and polypropylenes are the most&#8208;produced plastic waste globally, yet are difficult to convert into useful products due to their unreactivity. Pyrolysis is a practical method for large&#8208;scale treatment of mixed, contaminated plastic, allowing for their conversion into industrially&#8208;relevant petrochemicals. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), despite their tremendous utility in heterogeneous catalysis, have been overlooked for polyolefin depolymerization due to their perceived thermal instabilities and inability of polyethylenes and polypropylenes to penetrate their pores. Herein, we demonstrate the viability of UiO&#8208;66 MOFs containing coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated zirconium nodes, as effective catalysts for pyrolysis that significantly enhances the yields of valuable liquid and gas hydrocarbons, whilst halving the amounts of residual solids produced. Reactions occur on the Lewis&#8208;acidic UiO&#8208;66 nodes, without the need for noble metals, and yield aliphatic product distributions distinctly different from the aromatic&#8208;rich hydrocarbons that can be obtained from zeolite catalysis. We also demonstrate the first unambiguous characterization of polyolefin penetration into UiO&#8208;66 pores at pyrolytic temperatures, allowing access to the abundant Zr&#8208;oxo nodes within the MOF interior for efficient C&#8722;C cleavage. Our work highlights the potential of MOFs as highly&#8208;designable heterogeneous catalysts for depolymerisation of plastics, which can complement conventional catalysts in reactivity.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of various readily available cyclic, acyclic, and benzo&#8208;fused cyclic amines with a series of alkenylborate esters to prepare allylic amines was developed. This protocol features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, high E/Z and diastereoselectivities, and good compatibility with water and oxygen. Mechanistic studies suggest that the success of this chemistry relies on the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion.







Abstract
Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.

Herein, a ladder&#8208;type polymer (PNMZ) has been designed via a covalent cycloconjugation conformational strategy that exhibits optimized electronic structure and fast intra&#8208;chain charge transport within the high&#8208;aromaticity polymeric skeleton. As a result, the polymer exhibits exceptional proton&#8208;storage redox kinetics, which are evidenced by in&#8208;operando monitoring techniques and theoretical calculations. It achieves a remarkable proton&#8208;storage capacity of 189&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, with approximately 97.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 10,000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Supramolecular Modulator Enhancing Autophagy to Prevent Ventricular Arrythmias Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) triggered by myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading cause of sudden cardiac mortality worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies for managing MI&#8208;induced VAs, such as left stellate ganglion resection and ablation, are suboptimal, highlighting the need to explore safer and more effective intervention strategies. Herein, we rationally designed two supramolecular sonosensitizers RuA and RuB, engineered through acceptor modification to generate moderate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to modulate VAs. Both RuA and RuB demonstrated high ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated ROS production efficiency, with singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) of 0.70 and 0.88, respectively, surpassing ligand IR1105 and the conventional sonosensitizer ICG (&#934;&#916; =0.40). In vitro, RuB, at a modest concentration and under US intensity&#160;notably boosts pro&#8208;survival autophagy in microglia BV2 cell. To improve in vivo stability and biocompatibility, RuB was further encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG5000 to prepare RuB NPs. In vivo studies after microinjection of RuB NPs into the paraventricular nucleus&#160;and subsequent US exposure, demonstrated that RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation effectively suppresses sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and inflammatory responses, thereby preventing VAs. Importantly, no tissue injury was observed post RuB NPs&#8208;mediated US modulation. This work pioneers the design of long&#8208;wave emission supramolecular sonosensitizers, offering new insights into regulating cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Emissive Zirconium&#8208;Organic Frameworks Constructed via in situ &#8220;One&#8208;Pot&#8221; Single&#8208;Site Modification for Tryptophan Detection and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic linker&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive studies due to the unlimited species of emissive organic linkers and tunable structure of MOFs. However, the multiple&#8208;step organic synthesis is always a great challenge for the development of LMOFs. As an alternative strategy, in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy, in which the generation of emissive organic linkers and sequential construction of LMOFs happen in one reaction condition, can avoid time&#8208;consuming pre&#8208;synthesis of organic linkers. In the present work, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy to construct a series of LMOFs via the single&#8208;site modification between the reaction of aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs possess csq topology with emission covering blue to near&#8208;infrared. The nanosized LMOFs exhibit excellent sensitivity and selectivity for tryptophan detection. In addition, two component&#8208;based LMOFs can also be prepared via the in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy and used to study energy transfer. This work not only reports the construction of LMOFs with full&#8208;color emissions, which can be utilized for various applications, but also indicates that in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy indeed is a useful and powerful method to complement the traditional MOFs construction method for preparing porous materials with tunable functionalities and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical 6&#8208;Endo Addition Enables Pyridine Synthesis under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first radical 6&#8208;endo addition strategy to synthesize pyridines under metal&#8208;free conditions is reported. Experimental and computational studies indicate the critical roles of hypervalent iodine(III) for the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition rather than 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to afford pyridines.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to eliminating the need to remove trace metal catalysts from the reaction. We report a radical 6&#8208;endo addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal&#8208;free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2&#8197;units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with 57 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late&#8208;stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Flexibility of Chiral Organic Crystals with Highly Efficient Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible crystals with unique mechanical properties have presented enormous applications in optoelectronics, soft robotics and sensors. However, there have been no reports of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant flexible crystals with second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties (NLO). Here, we report the flexible chiral Schiff&#8208;base crystals capable of efficient second harmonic generation (SHG). Both enantiomers and racemic modifications of these crystals are mechanically flexible in two directions at both room temperature and at &#8208;196 &#176;C, although their mechanical responses differ. The enantiomers display SHG with an intensity of up to 12 times that of potassium dihydrogenphosphate (KDP) when pumped at 980 nm, and they also have high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Even when bent, the crystals retain strong second harmonic generation, although with a different intensity distribution depending on the polarization, compared to when they are straight. This work describes the first instance of flexible organic crystal with NLO properties and lays the foundation for the development of mechanically flexible organic NLO materials.</dc:description>

Abstract
A unique direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aminoimines is realized, through rapid and exclusive mono&#8208;allylation of chiral bis&#8208;N&#8208;sulfinylimines using allylboronic acids. The highly selective allylation was possible as electrophilic imine functional group in the product &#945;&#8208;aminoimines remained unreactive towards allyl boronic acid nucleophiles. Notably, by varying the geometry and chiral auxiliary, all four isomers of the &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were accessed from readily available precursors. A range of allyl nucleophiles, which are tricky to generate by other means possessing highly reactive functional groups also took part in this reaction, expanding the scope further. The applicability of the products &#945;&#8208;aminoimines were further demonstrated by accessing a range of structurally diverse chiral cyclic and acyclic 1,2&#8208;diamines bearing adjacent stereocenters through addition of a second nucleophile or Prins&#8208;type cyclization by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the tethered alkene moiety. Moreover, the leaving group aptitude of sulfinyl auxiliary attached to imine, was exploited to access valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles under thermal conditions without employing any reagents. Detailed DFT calculation revealed a chair&#8208;like transition state, arising from corresponding allylboroxine species, likely operating for the allylboration reaction across imine.

&lt;p&gt;The first direct asymmetric synthesis of &#945;-aminoimines is achieved employing chiral bis-sulfinylimines and allylboronic acids. The exclusive monoallylation occurred at room temperature with complete stereodivergence. The reactivity difference of the spare imine toward allylboronic acids and metal-based nucleophiles, is a major highlight of this protocol. Chiral 1,2-diamines and &#945;-aminonitriles were readily accessed from &#945;-aminoimines.

         <title>High Performance Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;electronic Polymeric Conductor with Stability to Autoclave Sterilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a series of newly developed donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers designed specifically for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) synthesized by a straightforward route. All polymers exhibited accumulation mode behavior in OECT devices, and tuning of the donor comonomer resulted in a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in transconductance. The best polymer gFBT&#8208;g2T, exhibited normalized peak transconductance (gm,norm) of 298&#177;10.4 S cm&#8208;1 with a corresponding product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance, &#956;C*, of 847 F V&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 and a &#956; of 5.76 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, amongst the highest reported to date. Furthermore, gFBT&#8208;g2T exhibited exceptional temperature stability, maintaining the outstanding electrochemical performance even after undergoing a standard (autoclave) high pressure steam sterilization procedure. Steam treatment was also found to promote film porosity, with the formation of circular 200 &#8211; 400 nm voids. These results demonstrate the potential of gFBT&#8208;g2T in p&#8208;type accumulation mode OECTs, and pave the way for the use in implantable bioelectronics for medical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;scale Hierarchical Organic Photocatalytic Platform for Self&#8208;Suspending Sacrificial Hydrogen Production from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread application of photocatalysis for converting solar energy and seawater into hydrogen is generally hindered by limited catalyst activity and the lack of sustainable large&#8208;scale platforms. Here, a multi&#8208;scale hierarchical organic photocatalytic platform was developed, combining a photosensitive molecular heterojunction with a molecular&#8208;scale gradient energy level alignment and micro&#8208;nanoscale hierarchical pore structures. The ternary system facilitates efficient charge transfer and enhances photocatalytic activity compared to conventional donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Meanwhile, the super&#8208;wetted hierarchical interfaces of the platform endow it with the ability to repeatedly capture light and self&#8208;suspend below the water surface, which simultaneously improves the light utilization efficiency, and reduces the adverse effects of salt deposition. Under a Xe lamp illumination, the hydrogen evolution rate of this organic platform utilizing a sacrificial agent can reach 165.8 mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2, exceeding that of mostly inorganic systems as reported. And upon constructing a scalable system, the platform produced 80.6 ml m&#8722;2 of hydrogen from seawater within five hours at noon. More importantly, the outcomes suggest an innovative multi&#8208;scale approach that bridges disciplines, advancing the frontier of sustainable seawater hydrogen production driven by solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Atom Efficient Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines Using Formaldehyde as a Single Carbon Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present an innovative and atom&#8208;efficient synthesis of trimethine cyanines (Cy3) using formaldehyde (FA) as a single&#8208;carbon reagent. The widespread application of Cy3 dyes in bioimaging and genomics/proteomics is often limited by synthetic routes plagued with low atom economy and substantial side&#8208;product formation. Through systematic investigation, we have developed a practical and efficient synthetic pathway for both symmetric and asymmetric Cy3 derivatives, significantly minimizing resource utilization. Notably, this approach yields water as the byproduct, in alignment with sustainable chemistry principles. Moreover, the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis facilitates the detection of intracellular FA levels, utilizing the fluorescence signal of Cy3 in live cells. It is also possible to detect the endogenous FA in the intestinal tissues. We observed a significant decrease of FA in the small intestine of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mice compared to the healthy mice. This methodological advancement not only enhances the scope of fluorescent dye synthesis but also contributes to the sustainable practices within chemical manufacturing, offering a significant leap forward in the development of environmentally friendly synthetic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>The nature of structural defects in ZIF&#8208;8 revealed with 1H and 31P MAS NMR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) attract interest as potential catalysts whose catalytic properties are driven by defects. Several methods have been proposed for the defects&#8208;inducing synthesis of MOFs. However, the active species formed on the defective sites remain elusive and uncharacterized, as the spectroscopic fingerprints of these species are hidden by the regular structure signals. In this work, we have performed the synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 MOF with defect&#8208;inducing procedures using fully deuterated 2&#8208;methylimidazolate ligands to enhance the defective sites' visibility. By combining 1H and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we have found evidence for the presence of different structural hydroxyl Zn&#8211;OH groups in the ZIF&#8208;8 materials. It is demonstrated that the ZIF&#8208;8 defect sites are represented by Zn&#8211;OH hydroxyl groups with the signals at 0.3 and &#8211;0.7 ppm in 1H MAS NMR spectrum. These species are of basic nature and may be responsible for the catalytic activity of the ZIF&#8208;8 material.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from Helical Superstructures of Chiral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral supramolecular aggregates have the potential to explore circularly polarized lasing with large dissymmetry factors. However, the controllable assembly of chiral superstructures towards deterministic circularly polarized laser emission remains elusive. Here, we design a pair of chiral organic molecules capable of stacking into a pair of definite helical superstructures in microcrystals, which enables circularly polarized lasing with deterministic chirality and high dissymmetry factors. The microcrystals function as optical cavities and gain media simultaneously for laser oscillations, while the supramolecular helices endow the laser emission with strong and opposite chirality. As a result, the microcrystals of two enantiomers allow for circularly polarized laser emission with opposite chirality and high dissymmetry factors up to ~1.0. This work demonstrates the chiral supramolecular assemblies as an excellent platform for high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasers.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Active Sites in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;depth understanding of the real&#8208;time behaviors of active sites during electrocatalysis is essential for the advancement of sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the concept of dynamic active sites has been recognized as a potent approach for creating self&#8208;adaptive electrocatalysts that can address a variety of electrocatalytic reactions, outperforming traditional electrocatalysts with static active sites. Nonetheless, the comprehension of the underlying principles that guide the engineering of dynamic active sites is presently insufficient. In this review, we systematically analyze the fundamentals of dynamic active sites for electrocatalysis and consider important future directions for this emerging field. We reveal that dynamic behaviors and reversibility are two crucial factors that influence electrocatalytic performance. By reviewing recent advances in dynamic active sites, we conclude that implementing dynamic electrocatalysis through variable reaction environments, correlating the model of dynamic evolution with catalytic properties, and developing localized and ultrafast in&#8208;situ/operando techniques are keys to designing high&#8208;performance dynamic electrocatalysts. This review paves the way to the development of the next&#8208;generation electrocatalyst and the universal theory for both dynamic and static active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals with Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemistry traditionally relies on reactions in solution, but this method is increasingly problematic due to the scale of chemical processes and their economic and environmental impact. Handling residual chemical waste, including solvents, incurs significant costs and environmental pressure. Conversely, novel chemical approaches are needed to address pressing societal issues such as climate change, energy scarcity, food insecurity, and waste pollution. Mechanochemistry, a sustainable chemistry discipline that uses mechanical action to induce chemical reactivity without bulk solvents, is a hot topic in academic research on sustainable and green chemistry. Given its fundamentally different working principles from solution chemistry, mechanochemistry offers more efficient chemical processes and the opportunity to design new chemical reactions. Mechanochemistry has a profound impact on many urgent issues facing our society and it is now necessary to use mechanochemistry to address them. This Minireview aims to provide a guide for using mechanochemistry to meet the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby contributing to a prosperous society. Detailed analysis shows that mechanochemistry connects with most UN SDGs and offers more cost&#8208;efficiency than other approaches together with a superior environmental performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Co&#8208;operative Energy Transfer in Copper(I) Complexes Using Two&#8208;Photon Absorbing Diimine&#8208;Based Ligand Sensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis mediated by low energy light wavelengths has potential to enable safer, sustainable synthetic methods. A phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligand bathocupSani, with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross section was used to construct a heteroleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)(DPEPhos)]BF4 and a homoleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4. The ligand and the respective homoleptic complex with copper exhibit two&#8208;photon upconversion with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.2 eV using red light. The complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 promoted energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchange of CO2&#160;with CO as Reactant Switches Selectivity in Photoreduction on Co&#8211;ZrO2&#160;from C1&#8211;3&#160;Paraffin to Small Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2,3 hydrocarbons completes a C&#8208;neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C2,3 paraffin and C2H4 from CO2 are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co0&#8211;ZrO2 photocatalyst converted CO2 into C1&#8211;3 paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C2H4 and C3H6 (6.0 &#177; 0.6 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1, 70 mol%) only under UV&#8211;visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under 13CO and H2, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C2H4 and C3H6 increased up to 61&#8211;87 mol%, attributed to the accumulation of CH2 species at the interface between Co0 nanoparticles and the ZrO2 surface. CO2 adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO2 surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co0 surface to yield C1&#8211;3 paraffin using either H2 or H2O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co0 surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO2, respectively. This comprehensive study elucidates intricate photocatalytic pathways governing the transformation of CO2 into paraffin and CO to olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Confined Ultracapacitive Memristors with Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of bioinspired iontronics, bridging electronic devices and ionic systems, has multiple biological applications. Carbon&#8208;based ultracapacitive devices hold promise for controlling bioactive ions via electric double layers due to their high&#8208;surface&#8208;area and biocompatible porous carbon electrodes. However, the interplay between complex bioactive ions and porous carbons remains unclear due to the variety of structures of bioactive ions present in biological systems. Herein, we investigate the adsorption behavior of a series of bioactive ammonium&#8208;based cations with varying alkyl chain lengths in nanoporous carbons. We find that strong physisorption results from the synergistic hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction between porous carbons (with a negative zeta potential) and bioactive cations. Bioactive cations with varying alkyl chain lengths can be irreversibly physically adsorbed and confined within nanoporous carbons resulting in anion enrichment and depletion during electric polarization. This situation, in turn, results in a characteristic memristive behavior in all&#8208;carbon capacitive ionic memristor devices. Our findings highlight the relationship between the resistance state of the memristor and ion adsorption mechanisms in all&#8208;carbon capacitive devices, which hold potential for future transmitter delivery, biointerfacing, and neuromorphic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing and Inhibiting the Facet&#8208;related Ion Migration for&#160;Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion migration is a major issue hindering the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). As an intrinsic characteristic of metal halide perovskite materials, ion migration is closely related to the atomic arrangement and coordination, which are the basic characteristic differences among various facets. Herein, we report the facet&#8208;related ion migration, and then achieve the inhibition of ion migration in perovskite through finely modulating the facet orientation. We show that the (100) facet is substantially more vulnerable to cationic migration than the (111) facet. The main reason for this difference in migration is that the cationic migration route in the (111) facet deviates from that in the (100) facet, which increases the active migration energy and weakens the contribution from the electric field during operation. We prepare a (111)&#8208;dominated perovskite film by incorporating a facile and green addition of water (H2O) into the antisolvent, further achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.0% (25.4% certification) on regular planar PSCs and 25.8% on inverted PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain 95% of their initial PCE after 3500&#8208;hours operation under simulated AM1.5 illumination at the maximum power point.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Tailoring of Chemical Composition and Morphology Configuration in Metal Hexacyanoferrate for Ultrafast and Durable Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) with adjustable composition and open framework structures have been considered as intriguing cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Exploiting MHCFs with ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity is always a goal that many investigators pursue, but remains challenging. Herein, simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high&#8208;entropy MHCF (HMHE&#8208;HCF) assembled by nanocubes for the first time to realize the objective. The &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; of high&#8208;entropy construction, rich sodium content of monoclinic phase, and unique hollow structure endow HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode with fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance during continuous charging/discharging processes. As a result, the HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode demonstrates superior rate performance up to an ultra&#8208;high rate of 100 C (71.1% retention to 0.1 C), and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.8% over 25,000 cycles at 100 C, outperforming most reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. Further, the HMHE&#8208;HCF//hard carbon full&#8208;cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 C and 10 C, respectively, and retains 98.1% of the initial capacity after 1,600 cycles at 5C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium&#8208;ion storage.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) with adjustable composition and open framework structures have been considered as intriguing cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Exploiting MHCFs with ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity is always a goal that many investigators pursue, but remains challenging. Herein, simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high-entropy MHCF (HMHE-HCF) assembled by nanocubes for the first time to realize the objective. The &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; of high-entropy construction, rich sodium content of monoclinic phase, and unique hollow structure endow HMHE-HCF cathode with fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance during continuous charging/discharging processes. As a result, the HMHE-HCF cathode demonstrates superior rate performance up to an ultra-high rate of 100 C (71.1% retention to 0.1 C), and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.8% over 25,000 cycles at 100 C, outperforming most reported sodium-ion cathodes. Further, the HMHE-HCF//hard carbon full-cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 C and 10 C, respectively, and retains 98.1% of the initial capacity after 1,600 cycles at 5C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium-ion storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembly Regulates Gamma Radiation Polymerization of Polytelluoxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating chemical drug's responsiveness to gamma radiation is crucial for achieving better therapeutic effects in cancer treatment. Most research focused on thermodynamic chemical structure design, while little attention was paid to kinetic regulate strategy, which possesses greater universality and security. In this study, we achieved a kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy of gamma radiation reaction, through the construction of microphase environment during polymerization of polytelluoxane (PTeO). We designed hydrophobic segments forming large compound micelles (LCMs) assembly to create kinetically favorable higher concentration for radiation&#8208;induced reaction. It exhibited a &gt; ten times higher responsiveness and, as far as we know, merely required a minimum dosage of 5 Gy for polymerization to occur. What&#8217;s more, by taking advantages of the assembly change with Te&#8208;O hydrophilic segments and gamma radiation, polymerization became milder with lower polydispersity than previous methods. Such kinetic&#8208;based regulate strategy could offer a novel perspective on the design of radiation&#8208;responsive chemoradiotherapy and other radiation&#8208;induced chemical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Acene&#8208;Integrated Buckybowls with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption and over 90% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracene and pentacene are large, promising building blocks for construction of complex molecular nanocarbons due to their extraordinary photophysical and electronic properties. Herein, two acene&#8208;integrated buckybowls, composed of two rows of tetracenes and pentacenes fused through s&#8208;indacene unit at the zigzag edges, have been synthesized and characterized. Compared to parent tetracene and pentacene, the buckybowls are extremely stable and show much smaller electrochemical band&#160;gaps. Kinetic studies gave the bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barriers of 11.7 and 13.3 kcal mol&#8208;1. Subsequent investigations on magnetic ring currents revealed two local diatropic currents at two rows of acenes and one paratropic current at the s&#8208;indacene unit, respectively. Notably, both buckybowls show a broad absorption that reaches into near&#8208;infrared II region, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&gt; 90%) was achieved when exposed to near&#8208;infrared 1064 nm laser photo&#8208;irradiation. This study highlights the unusual nature of merging the intrinsic properties of acenes with the inherent properties of buckybowls and showcases a potential avenue for acene utilization for the design of novel complex nanocarbons with a broad range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dot Photoresist for Direct Photolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresists are promising building blocks for photolithographically patterned devices. However, their complex synthesis and combination processes limit their optical properties and potential patterning applications. Here, we present an exceptionally simple strategy for the synthesis of PQDs photoresist. Unlike traditional approaches that involve centrifugation, separation, and combination processes, our direct synthesis technique using polymerizable acrylic monomer as solvent to fabricate PQDs photoresists without complex post&#8208;synthesis process. We demonstrate that the change in solubility of the precursors is the main reason for the formation of PQDs in the polymerizable monomer. By direct photolithography, colorful PQD patterns with high photoluminescence quantum yields and excellent fluorescence uniformity are successfully demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of PQDs photoresist, expanding their applications in various integrated applications, such as photonic, energy harvesting, and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208;independent orthogonal photoswitching has been achieved by combining peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based photoswitch. Four persistent colors can be interchanged by irradiation with light and could be transferred to a multi&#8208;photochromic transparent polymer material. The addition of a third fluorophore component enables advanced all&#8208;photonic logic operations.







Abstract
Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains highly challenging. Herein we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path&#8208; independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208; peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix to yield a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as a third component is possible, demonstrating the applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Controlled Interpenetrated MOF@COF via C&#8722;C Linkage for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;atom simulations suggest that a transient K+ ion at the catalytic site promotes catalysis in RNase mitochondrial RNA processing complex by rigidifying the active site and promoting proton transfer from the water nucleophile to the scissile phosphate. Conversely, the third Mg2+ ion captured in the experimental structure hinders catalysis by blocking the proton transfer and preventing the approach of the K+ ion.







Abstract
Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5&#8242;&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.

         <title>Improved Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis through Hydrogen Poisoning Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen poisoning effects over NiCoP@CC occurring at low overpotentials can leave behind catalytically inert poisoned HI* at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereby create ideally reactive HII*. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for HER was suppressed due to catalytic inertia of HI* and thereby NITRR was timely initiated through HII* owing to ideal hydrogenation reactivity of HII*. As a result, a record high NH3 production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion from nitrate to ammonia is a key step in sustainable ammonia production. However, it suffers from low productive efficiency or high energy consumption due to a lack of desired electrocatalysts. Here we report nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrocatalysis that display a record&#8208;high catalytic current density of &#8722;702&#177;7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ammonia production rate of 5415&#177;26&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 99.7&#177;0.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, affording the estimated energy consumption as low as 22.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that these catalysts benefit from hydrogen poisoning effects, which leave behind catalytically inert adsorbed hydrogen species (HI*) at Co&#8208;hollow sites and thereupon enable ideally reactive HII* at secondary Co&#8722;P sites. The dimerization between HI* and HII* for H2 evolution is blocked due to the catalytic inertia of HI* thereby the HII* drives nitrate hydrogenation timely. With these catalysts, the continuous ammonia production is further shown in an electrolyser with a real energy consumption of 18.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonds Based Reprogrammable and Re&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Elastomer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked LCE network based on metal&#8208;ligand bonds can achieve orientation programming of liquid crystal mesogen via partial stress relaxation. This programmed LCE maintains stable actuation even at elevated temperatures due to the high strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds comparable to traditional covalent bonds. The flexible and reversible nature of metal&#8208;ligand interactions also allows for the reprogramming of actuation behaviors and enables reprocessing and reshaping upon complete dissociation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonds endow liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with network rearrangeability, facilitating the fixation of mesogen alignment induced by external forces and enabling reversible actuation. In comparison, the bond exchange of supramolecular interactions is typically too significant to stably maintain the programmed alignment, particularly under intensified external stimuli. Nevertheless, remaking and recycling of supramolecular interaction&#8208;based polymer networks are more accessible than those based on dynamic covalent bonds, as the latter are difficult to completely dissociate. Thus, preparing an LCE that possesses both supramolecular&#8208;like exchangeability and covalent bond&#8208;level stability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we addressed this issue by employing metal&#8208;ligand bonds as the crosslinking points of LCE networks. As such, mesogen alignment can be repeatedly encoded through metal&#8208;ligand bond exchange and stably maintained after programming, since the bond exchange rate is sufficiently slow when the programming and actuation temperatures are below the bond dissociation temperature. More importantly, the metal&#8208;ligand bonds can be completely dissociated at high temperatures, allowing the LCE network to be dissolved in a solvent and reshaped into desired geometries via solution casting. Building on these properties, our LCEs can be fabricated into versatile actuators, such as reversible folding origami, artificial muscles, and soft robotics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative in situ EPR monitoring strategy is introduced to investigate the active species involved in the ORR&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 pathways by electro&#8208;, photo&#8208; and piezo&#8208;catalysis. The formation of immediate species in piezo&#8208;catalysis is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis, offering prospective evidence to support the choice of mechanism for piezo&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
For piezoelectric catalysis, the catalytic mechanism is a topic of great controversy, with debates centered around whether it belongs to the energy band theory or the screening charge effect which are similar to mechanisms of photocatalysis and electrochemical catalysis, respectively. Due to the formation of different intermediate active&#8208;species during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalysis, the key to solving this problem is precisely monitoring the active species involved in ORR during electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and piezo&#8208;catalysis under identical condition. Here, a semiconductor material, BiOBr with abundant oxygen vacancies (BOB&#8208;OV) was found remarkable catalytic activity in H2O2 production by all three catalytic methods. By employing in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the H2O2 evolution pathway through piezo&#8208;catalysis over BOB&#8208;OV was monitored, which showed a similar reaction pathway to that observed in photo&#8208;catalytic process. This finding represents solid evidence supporting the notion that piezo&#8208;catalytic mechanism of ORR is more inclined towards photo&#8208;catalysis rather than electro&#8208;catalysis. Significantly, this exploratory conclusion provides insight to deepen our understanding of piezo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Reductive Elimination From Tetra&#8208;Alkyl Cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;4): Beyond Simple Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full series of high&#8208;valent cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722;, 0&#8804;n&#8804;4, has been studied by a combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations. The distinct reactivities observed can be attributed to subtle differences in the electronic structures of the complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, the electronic structures of organocuprates in general and the complex [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; in particular have attracted significant interest. A possible key indicator in this context is the reactivity of these species. Nonetheless, this aspect has received only limited attention. Here, we systematically study the series of tetra&#8208;alkyl cuprates [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; and their unimolecular reactivity in the gas phase, which includes concerted formal reductive eliminations as well as radical losses. Through computational studies, we characterize the electronic structures of the complexes and show how these are connected to their reactivity. We find that all [MenCu(CF3)4&#8722;n]&#8722; ions feature inverted ligand fields and that the distinct reactivity patterns of the individual complexes arise from the interplay of different effects.

         <title>Molecular Bridging Induced Anti&#8208;Salting&#8208;Out Effect Enabling High Ionic Conductive ZnSO4&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. The urea molecules adsorbed on electrode are electropolymerized under voltage to form organic SEI. Such SEI functions as a binder, stabilizing the electrode interface and promoting uniform Zn deposition. Additionally, this SEI layer effectively mitigates side reactions, thereby enhancing the overall electrochemical performance and durability of the electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs) hold great promise in tackling severe issues emerging in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, but the prevalent salting&#8208;out effect of kosmotropic salt causes low ionic conductivity and electrochemical instability. Herein, a subtle molecular bridging strategy is proposed to enhance the compatibility between PVA and ZnSO4 from the perspective of hydrogen&#8208;bonding microenvironment re&#8208;construction. By introducing urea containing both an H&#8208;bond acceptor and donor, the broken H&#8208;bonds between PVA and H2O, initiated by the SO42&#8722;&#8208;driven H2O polarization, could be re&#8208;united via intense intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus leading to greatly increased carrying capacity of ZnSO4. The urea&#8208;modified PVA&#8208;ZnSO4 HEs featuring a high ionic conductivity up to 31.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 successfully solves the sluggish ionic transport dilemma at the solid&#8208;solid interface. Moreover, an organic solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase can be derived from the in situ electro&#8208;polymerization of urea to prohibit H2O&#8208;involved side reactions, thereby prominently improving the reversibility of Zn chemistry. Consequently, Zn anodes witness an impressive lifespan extension from 50&#8197;h to 2200&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery maintains a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (&gt;99.7&#8201;%) even after 8000 cycles. The anti&#8208;salting&#8208;out strategy proposed in this work provides an insightful concept for addressing the phase separation issue of functional HEs.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Gradient Interface for High&#8208;Rate PEO&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic gradient SEI layer (SCG&#8208;SEI) exhibits a low nucleation overpotential along with strong mechanical strength, enabling rapid Li+ diffusion and electron conduction. This synergistic effect facilitates the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, thus ensuring excellent cells performance even under ultra&#8208;high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and high current density (5&#8197;C).







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are strongly hindered by the fast dendrite growth at the Li metal/electrolyte interface, especially under large rates. The above issue stems from the suboptimal interfacial chemistry and poor Li+ transport kinetics during cycling. Herein, a SnF2&#8208;catalyzed lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SCG&#8208;SEI) of LixSny/LiF&#8208;Li2O is in situ formed. The superior ionic LiF&#8208;Li2O rich upper layer (17.1&#8197;nm) possesses high interfacial energy and fast Li+ diffusion channels, wherein lithiophilic LixSny alloy layer (8.4&#8197;nm) could highly reduce the nucleation overpotential with lower diffusion barrier and promote rapid electron transportation for reversible Li+ plating/stripping. Simultaneously, the insoluble SnF2&#8208;coordinated PEO promotes the rapid Li+ ion transport in the bulk phase. As a result, an over 46.7 and 3.5&#8197;times improvements for lifespan and critical current density of symmetrical cells are achieved, respectively. Furthermore, LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLMBs deliver a recorded cycling performance at 5&#8197;C (over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.0&#8201;%). More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and pouch cell with LiFePO4, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100&#8201;&#176;C), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high&#8208;rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.

More importantly, impressive electrochemical performances and safety tests with LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pouch cell with LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, even under extreme conditions (i.e., 100&#8201;&#176;C), are also demonstrated, reconfirmed the importance of lithiophilic-lithiophobic gradient interfacial chemistry in the design of high-rate ASSLMBs for safety applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Debonding of Mussel&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensitive Adhesives: Improving Efficiency Through Functional Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) can be employed to form strong adhesive polymers, which are debondable by an oxidative trigger. The properties of such polymers can be tuned via the backbone of the monomers. Here, a nature&#8208;inspired peptidic biscatechol is compared to a fossil&#8208;based analogue. The catechol&#8208;amide interactions exhibited by the dipeptide allow for a more efficient debonding mechanism, outperforming the plain catechol oxidation variant.







Abstract
Debondable pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) promise access to recyclability in microelectronics in the transition toward a circular economy. Two PSAs were synthesized from a tetravalent thiol star&#8208;polyester forming thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) with either the biorelated DiDopa&#8208;bisquinone (BY*Q) or the fossil&#8208;based bisquinone A (BQA). The PSAs enable debonding by oxidation of TCC&#8208;catechols to quinones. The extent of debonding efficiency depends on the interaction modes, which are determined by the chemical structure differences of both TCC&#8208;motifs. BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA debonds with exceptional loss of 99&#8201;% of its approx. 2&#8197;MPa shear strength in glass&#8208;on&#8208;glass junctions. For BQA&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA, a debonding efficiency of only approx. 60&#8201;% was found, irrespective of its initial shear strength, which could be tuned up to approx. 7&#8197;MPa. The efficiency of debonding for BY*Q&#8208;TCC&#8208;PSA after TCC&#8208;oxidation is linked to the loss of synergistic interactions without strongly affecting the bulk glue properties, outperforming the purely catechol&#8208;based BQA&#8208;analogue.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Self&#8208;Organized Chloro&#8208;Bridged Cubic Pd(II) Cage Showing Selective Encapsulation of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise formation of a metal&#8208;chloride neutral cage has been shown to involve the initial pre&#8208;organization of the Pd3 subunits of a Pd6&#8208;hexamer mediated by a directional oxamide linker to a tetrameric Pd12 assembly followed by its conversion into a Pd12&#8208;tetrahedron and finally to a chloro&#8208;bridged Pd24 cube upon ligand substitution. The Pd24&#8208;cube shows selective encapsulation of phenolic guest molecules.







Abstract
The synthesis and guest recognition properties of a neutral Pd24&#8208;cubic cage, [{Pd3(NiPr)3PO}8(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)24] 1 are reported. The formation of the cubical assembly takes place by an exclusive one&#8208;pot ligand&#8208;assisted pathway directed by an oximido linker. The initial coordination of the oximido ligand pre&#8208;organizes the [Pd3(NiPr)3PO]3+ polyhedral building units into a tetrameric intermediate, which then transforms into an oximido&#8208;tethered tetrahedral assembly and to the cubical cage 1 in the presence of chloride ions. In the absence of the directing oximido linker, no cage formation was observed, and the Pd6&#8208;precursor was found to undergo self&#8208;condensation, giving rise to a new pentameric polyhedral cluster, [Pd5{(NiPr)3PO}2(OAc)2(OH)2] 2. The central cavity of the cube has been probed for guest encapsulation studies, which shows a high binding with phenolic guest molecules with association constants of the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The favorable formation of host&#8211;guest complexes was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest functional groups.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>The Formation Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Carbonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the formation mechanism of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) by exploring the effect of crosslinking on the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are revealed, and the higher crosslinking degree can also bring a higher carbonization degree to realize the regulation of photoluminescence.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as a kind of zero&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, have been widely synthesized by bottom&#8208;up methods from various precursors. However, the formation mechanism is still unclear and controversial, which also brings difficulty to the regulation of structures and properties. Only some tentative formation processes were postulated by analyzing the products obtained at different reaction times and temperatures. Here, the effect of crosslinking on the formation of carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is explored. Crosslinking&#8208;induced nucleation and carbonization (CINC) is proposed as the driving force for the formation of CPDs. Under hydrothermal synthesis, the precursors are initiated to polymerize and crosslink. The crosslinking brings higher hydrophobicity to generate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation, which promotes dehydration and carbonization resulting in the formation of CPDs. Based on the principle of CINC, the influence factors of size are also revealed. Moreover, the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation is employed to support this formation mechanism. This concept of CINC will bring light to the formation process of CPDs, as well as facilitate the regulation of CPDs&#8217; size and photoluminescence.

         <title>Simultaneous Material and Chemical Recycling of Waste PET/PE Multi&#8208;Layer Films under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a hydrothermal process equipped with two filters for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) multi&#8208;layer films. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa, around 100&#8201;% of PET is hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Meanwhile, PE, TPA, and EG are collected separately using the same system, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films is firstly achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;layer plastic films are widely used in various fields especially for packaging, but due to complex composition, it is very difficult to recover single&#8208;material polymers or high&#8208;purity monomers from them after usage. In this study, we proposed a hydrothermal process for recycling PET/PE (PET: Polyethylene terephthalate; PE: Polyethylene) films. PET can be hydrolyzed to monomers of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Using a hydrothermal system equipped with two filters, PE, TPA, and EG were collected separately, indicating the simultaneous material and chemical recycling of PET/PE films was firstly achieved. At 300&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;MPa for 60&#8197;min, PET conversion reached around 100&#8201;%, and TPA yield of 83.0&#8201;% was obtained with a high TPA purity of 96.1&#8201;%. In addition, the effect of the holding time on PET conversion, TPA yield, EG yield, and TPA purity was studied. This research opened up a new and sustainable pathway to recycle multi&#8208;layer plastic films in both lab and industry.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Pd&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Macrocyclic Sulfonamide for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Precisely Constructing Molecular Junctions in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to introduce CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation sites into the framework. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport, which achieves an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%).







Abstract
The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction&#8208;type porphyrin&#8208;based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP) was successfully self&#8208;assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni&#8208;TCPP&#8208;TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (selectivity, ~100&#8201;%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single&#8208;component photocatalyst (Ni&#8208;TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure&#8208;function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

In this protocol, a series of benzofuran-fused-piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound &lt;b&gt;16&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; was identified as potent and intestine specific P-gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P-gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P-gp exists in many tissues, the non-selective P-gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P-gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P-gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post-modification, various benzofuran-fused-piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified &lt;b&gt;16&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; with potent P-gp inhibitory activity. Notably, &lt;b&gt;16&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and &lt;b&gt;16&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Meisenheimer Complexes as Powerful Photoreductants Readily Obtained from Aza&#8208;Hetero Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong reducing systems (&#8804;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE) can be obtained simply and practically by adding nBuLi to available heterocyclic compounds (pyridine, isoquinoline, etc) and using them under irradiation at 456&#8197;nm. Strong photoreductans obtained are capable of reducing electron&#8208;rich arylchlorides.







Abstract
Excited states of radical anions derived from the photoreduction of stable organic molecules are suggested to serve as potent reductants. However, excited states of these species are too short&#8208;lived to allow bimolecular quenching processes. Recently, the singlet excited state of Meisenheimer complexes, which possess a long&#8208;lived excited state, was identified as the competent species for the reduction of challenging organic substrates (&#8722;2.63&#8197;V vs. SCE, saturated calomel electrode). To produce reasonably stable and simply accessible different Meisenheimer complexes, the addition of nBuLi to readily available aromatic heterocycles was investigated, and the photoreactivity of the generated species was studied. In this paper, we present the straightforward preparation of a family of powerful photoreductants (*Eox&lt;&#8722;3&#8197;V vs. SCE in their excited states, determined by DFT and time&#8208;dependent TD&#8208;DFT calculations; DFT, density functional theory) that can induce dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl chlorides and to form C&#8722;C bond through radical cyclization. Photophysical analyses and computational studies in combination with experimental mechanistic investigations demonstrate the ability of the adduct to act as a strong electron donor under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Optimizing the Intermediates Adsorption by Manipulating the Second Coordination Shell of Ir Single Atoms for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Ir single atoms anchored on NiO via different bonding strategies, resulting in diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. The OER activity exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number. The improved activity of Ir1&#8722;NiO was attributed to the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni, which weakened the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates.







Abstract
The precise regulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with the desired local chemical environment is vital to elucidate the relationship between the SACs structure and the catalytic performance. The debate on the effect of the local coordination environment is quite complicated even for the SACs with the same composition and chemical nature, calling for increased attention on the regulation of the second coordination shell. For oxide&#8208;supported SACs, it remains a significant challenge to precisely manipulate the second coordination shell of single atoms supported on oxides due to the structural robustness of oxides. Here, Ir single atoms were anchored on NiO supports via different bonding strategies, resulting in the diverse Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers for Ir sites. Specifically, Ir1/NiO, Ir1&#8722;NiO, and Ir1@NiO SACs with increasing Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 5 were synthesized, respectively. We found that the activity of the three samples towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibited a volcano&#8208;shaped relationship with the Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni coordination number, with Ir1&#8722;NiO showing the lowest overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanism investigations indicate that the moderate coordination number of Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Ni in Ir1&#8722;NiO creates the higher occupied Ir dz2 orbital, weakening the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates and thereby enhancing the OER activity.

         <title>Integration of Perylene Diimide into a Covalent Organic Framework for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework based on perylene diimide (PDI&#8208;PDA) has been synthesized and characterized. Its photocatalytic efficiency in thioether oxidation to sulfoxide compounds was more than ten&#8208;fold higher than that of PDI&#8208;PH. The enhanced electron&#8208;induced O2 activation under visible light was due to improved charge separation and transfer.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have garnered considerable attention due to their immense potential in photocatalysis. However, manipulating the molecular packing within their aggregates and enhancing the efficiency of photogenerated carrier recombination remain significant challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the incorporation of a PDI unit into a covalent organic framework (COF), named PDI&#8208;PDA, by linking an ortho&#8208;substituted PDI with p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA) to control its intermolecular aggregation. The incorporation enables precise modulation of electron&#8208;transfer dynamics, leading to a ten&#8208;fold increase in the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation of thioether to sulfoxide with PDI&#8208;PDA compared to the PDI molecular counterpart, with yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. Electron property studies and density functional theory calculations show that the PDI&#8208;PDA with its well&#8208;defined crystal structure, enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lowers the electron transition barrier. Moreover, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the PDI unit promotes the spatial separation of the valency band maximum and conduction band minimum of PDI&#8208;PDA, suppressing the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and improving the charge&#8208;separation efficiency to give high photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a brief but effective way for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of commonly used PDI&#8208;based dyes by integrating them into a framework skeleton.

         <dc:description>The construction of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion system by mimicking the photosynthetic network of the chloroplast holds great promise on efficient solar energy utilization. We developed an artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) based on molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltage (1.1 V) and neutral condition (pH&#8776;7). The CoTPP&#8208;FePy can emulate the light reaction in thylakoids to produce O2 by coupling light harvesting, photocatalysis, and electron/energy storage (FeIII/FeII&#8208;Py). Subsequently, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were employed to simulate the dark reaction, wherein the proton, electron and energy generated by the light reaction can drive the H2 producing process. By a temporally and spatially coupling of the light and dark reactions, the resulting APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrating the potential of artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Sulfonylation of Allylic C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic sulfones are valuable motifs due to their medicinal and biological significance and their versatile chemical reactivities. While direct allylic C&#8211;H sulfonylation represents a straightforward and desirable approach, these methods are primarily restricted to terminal alkenes, leaving the engagement of the internal counterparts a formidable challenge. Herein we report a photocatalytic approach that accommodates both cyclic and acyclic internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns and electronic properties.

While direct allylic C&#8211;H sulfonylation represents a straightforward and desirable approach, these methods are primarily restricted to terminal alkenes, leaving the engagement of the internal counterparts a formidable challenge. Herein we report a photocatalytic approach that accommodates both cyclic and acyclic internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns and electronic properties. Importantly, the obtained allylic sulfones can be readily diversified into a wide range of products, thus enabling formal alkene transposition and all-carbon quaternary center formation through the sequential C&#8211;H functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Behavior via Controlled Molecular Film Formation Engineering Leads to Significant Improvement in Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quality of organic thin films critically influences carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors. In neat/doped films, even tiny voids can be penetrated by water or oxygen molecules to create charge&#8208;trap states called water/oxygen&#8208;induced traps that significantly hinder carrier mobility. While the water/oxygen&#8208;induced traps in non&#8208;doped films and crystalline states have been investigated comprehensively, there is a lack of thorough examination regarding their properties in the doped state. Therefore, there is a high demand for a molecular design strategy that effectively modulates the molecular stacking behavior in doped films and practical devices and enhances the quality of these films. Herein, we proposed a versatile molecular design principle that enables the formation of "nano&#8208;cluster" structures on both the surface and interior of doped films in target molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1'&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;spiro[acridine&#8208;9,9'&#8208;xanthene] (DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ), which is modified with a fluorophenyl group. These "nano&#8208;cluster" structures exhibit more uniform shapes within doped films and effectively reduce defective state densities while enhancing carrier injection and transport properties, ultimately improving device performance. Notably, TADF&#8208;OLED based on DspiroO&#8208;F&#8208;TRZ demonstrates nearly twice as much efficiency as its control counterpart due to contributions from 'nano&#8208;cluster' structure enhancements toward improved electroluminescence performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>Radiocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid from CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. This study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions (&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%).







Abstract
The C&#8722;C coupling of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to generate acetic acid (CH3COOH) represents a highly atom&#8208;efficient chemical conversion, fostering the comprehensive utilization of greenhouse gases. However, the inherent thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CH4 and CO2 present obstacles to achieving efficient and selective conversion at room temperature. Our study reveals that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) produced by water radiolysis can effectively activate CH4 and CO2, yielding methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3) and carbon dioxide radical anions(&#8901;CO2&#8722;) that facilitate the production of CH3COOH at ambient temperature. The introduction of radiation&#8208;synthesized CuO&#8208;anchored TiO2 bifunctional catalyst could further enhance reaction efficiency and selectivity remarkably by boosting radiation absorption and radical stability, resulting in a concentration of 7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 of CH3COOH with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%). These findings offer valuable insights for catalyst design and implementation in radiation&#8208;induced chemical conversion.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>

         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.

Abstract
We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to establish better surface coverage to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition methods through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to it exhibiting the highest crystallinity and hole mobility which is derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation. This resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45&#8201;%, which enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07&#8201;% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94&#8201;% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200&#8197;h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50&#8201;% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL. This greatly simplifies and broadens the scope for SAM to be used for large&#8208;area devices on diverse substrates.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme.

     alt="Light-Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light-driven and temperature-dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen-tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-C and Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-L. In contrast to the well-known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-C, photoconversion of Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-SR&#8217;&#8217; into Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-L is an active-site redox reaction that involves light-driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron-sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground-state intermediate Ni&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non-local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;S&#8208;Selective Stille&#8208;Coupling Enables Stereodefined Alkene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large-area blade-coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; OSC where a blade-coated PPDINN was used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Chemodivergent Parallel Kinetic Resolution of Paracyclophanes: Enantiomer Fishing with Different Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of catalytic strategy in asymmetric synthesis is disclosed, through which the parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) of the racemic substrate can be realized with two distinct achiral reactants. The current study also represents the seminal investigations on the PKR reaction of racemic compounds bearing planar chirality, the chemodivergent PKR reaction with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, and the catalytic approach for the preparation of chiral pyridines bearing multi&#8208;functionalities.







Abstract
An unprecedented chemodivergent strategy for parallel kinetic resolution (PKR) is disclosed through which two planar chiral products bearing different structures were simultaneously afforded with opposite stereoselectivities. Two achiral esters are activated by one single chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to react with the different enantiomers of the racemic imine substrate in a parallel fashion. Two products bearing distinct structures and opposite stereoselectivities are respectively afforded from the same reaction system in good to excellent yields, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Control experiments and kinetic studies are carried out to probe the kinetic and dynamic properties during the reaction progress. The planar chiral pyridine and lactam products show interesting applications in both asymmetric synthesis and pesticide development.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Co&#8208;Conversions of PBS Waste Plastics and Maleic Acid into High&#8208;Purity Succinic Acid Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA). The high&#8208;purity SA solid can be obtained by a carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach.







Abstract
Plastic pollution, an increasingly serious global problem, can be addressed through the full lifecycle management of plastics, including plastics recycling as one of the most promising approaches. System design, catalyst development, and product separation are the keys in improving the economics of electrocatalytic plastics recycling. Here, a membrane&#8208;free co&#8208;production system was devised to produce succinic acid (SA) at both anode and cathode respectively by the co&#8208;electrolysis of polybutylene succinate (PBS) waste plastics and biomass&#8208;derived maleic acid (MA) for the first time. To this end, Cr3+&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst featuring much enhanced 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) oxidation reaction (BOR) activity has been synthesized and the role of doped Cr has been revealed as an &#8220;electron puller&#8221; to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Ni2+/Ni3+ cycling. Impressively, an extra&#8208;high SA production rate of 3.02&#8197;g&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;high apparent Faraday efficiency towards SA (FEapparent=181.5&#8201;%) have been obtained. A carbon dioxide&#8208;assisted sequential precipitation approach has been developed to produce high&#8208;purity SA and byproduct NaHCO3 solids. Preliminary techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates that the reported system is economically profitable and promising for future industrial applications.

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose.

     alt="Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6-Anhydro-D-Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase &lt;i&gt;Zg&lt;/i&gt;GH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic-based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra-constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marine Bacteroidota &lt;i&gt;Zobellia galactanivorans&lt;/i&gt; has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;-3,6-anhydro-D-galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo-(&#945;-1,3)-3,6-anhydro-D-galactosidase &lt;i&gt;Zg&lt;/i&gt;GH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D-galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6-anhydro-D-galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;[&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and deglycosylation &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;[&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt; itineraries limited to the &lt;i&gt;Southern&lt;/i&gt; Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non-standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism-based inhibitor design for anhydro-type carbohydrate-processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxy&#8208;Carbonylation of Aryl and Vinyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here a Minireview which describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. This Minireview mainly highlights the developments in the asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. It will to provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral skeletons widely exist in natural products, bioactive compounds, and other functional molecules. Although significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric synthesis of centrally or axially chiral molecules over the past years, enantioselective constructing of planar chirality is still a big obstacle and numerous efforts have been made in this field. Previous works have mainly focused on the assembly of planar&#8208;chiral [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes and metallocenes. This Minireview describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles, including ansa chain construction, plane formation and asymmetric transformation strategies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will sever as a source of inspiration for developing new unconventional procedures for access to planar&#8208;chiral skeletons.

This Minireview describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar-chiral macrocycles, including &lt;i&gt;ansa&lt;/i&gt; chain construction, plane formation and asymmetric transformation strategies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will sever as a source of inspiration for developing new unconventional procedures for access to planar-chiral skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Borylative Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;Vinyl Cyclobutanols and Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Point Chirality Transfer in a Diastereoconvergent/Stereoretentive Allylation Scenery</title>

         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Electrochemical identification and quantification of through&#8208;plane proton channels in graphene oxide membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stacked graphene oxide (GO) proton membranes are promising candidates for use in energy devices due to their proton conductivity. Identification of through&#8208;plane channels in these membranes is critical but challenging due to their anisotropic nature. Here, we present an electrochemical reduction method for identifying and quantifying through&#8208;plane proton channels in GO membranes. The simplicity lies in the operando optical observation of the change in contrast as GO is electrochemically reduced. Here, we find three proton&#8208;dominated three&#8208;phase interfaces, which are critical for the reduction reactions of GO membranes. Based on these findings, a method is proposed to identify and quantify through&#8208;plane channels in stacked GO proton membranes using a simple three&#8208;electrode device in combination with real&#8208;time imaging of the membrane surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide for efficient, long&#8208;lasting zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8208; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O 2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8208;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8208;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (60.6% at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8% after 1050 charge&#8208;discharge cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Notably, oxidative (ortho&#8208;)demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs via a distinct reaction mechanism compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Dynamic Chirality in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Very recently, the control of dynamic chirality has emerged as a powerful strategy to design chiral functional materials. In this context, we describe herein a molecular design in which a tethered configurationally stable binaphthyl chiral unit efficiently controls the dynamic chirality of donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores, involving diverse indolocarbazoles as electron donors and terephthalonitrile as an electron acceptor. The high conformational discrimination in such a molecular system suggested by density functional theory calculations is experimentally probed using electronic and vibrational circular dichroism and confirmed by the crystallization of these chiral molecules in gel and their single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition to extending the scope of dynamic chirality control to donor&#8208;acceptor fluorophores, this work also highlights the positive effect of the configurationally stable chiral inductor on the magnitude of the dissymmetry factors of the active dynamically chiral fluorophores, both in ground and excited states, through chiral perturbation.</dc:description>

         <title>Employing singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer for boosting the reactivity of Type I photoinitiators in radical photopolymerization.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A remarkable and unexpected increase in the photopolymerization efficiency of an acrylic resin by a bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator was observed when an optical brightener was present in the medium. High values for the maximal rates of photopolymerization were obtained by RT&#8208;FTIR at 365 nm under a very low irradiance of 1 mW/cm2. Fluorescence studies revealed that the quenching process was attributed to singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer between the first singlet excited state of the optical brightener and the ground state photoinitiator. This mechanism acts as an additional pathway for the excitation of the photoinitiator, thereby increasing the total amount of initiating radicals. Using the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer model, we calculated the relative efficiency of the photosensitization process compared to the direct excitation efficiency of the photoinitiator. The results demonstrate that the photosensitization process can be predicted, paving the way for further improvements in photoinitiating systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Desymmetrization of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehydes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A desymmetrizing 1,2&#8208;addition of silicon nucleophiles to biaryl derivatives containing an 2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde&#8208;1&#8208;yl unit is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by copper with a triazolium&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the chiral ligand and an Si&#8211;B reagent as the silicon pronucleophile. The practical methodology furnishes axially chiral aromatic carbaldehydes decorated with a centrally chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxysilane moiety in moderate to high yields and with high enantio&#8208; as well as excellent diastereoselectivities. The silicon nucleophile always attacks at either carbonyl group away from the ortho substituent on the phenyl ring at C1 of the 2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde&#8208;1&#8208;yl fragment. The resulting axially and centrally chiral products can be further converted into valuable biaryl compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Visible Light Sensitization of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in Dimeric LnIII/GaIII Metallacrowns through Functionalization with RuII Complexes for NIR&#8208;II Multiplex Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplex imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) provides exciting opportunities for more precise understanding of biological processes and more accurate diagnosis of diseases by enabling real&#8208;time acquisition of images with improved contrast and spatial resolution in deeper tissues. Today, the number of imaging agents suitable for this modality remains very scarce. In this work, we have synthesized and fully characterized, including theoretical calculations, a series of dimeric LnIII/GaIII metallacrowns bearing RuII polypyridyl complexes, LnRu&#8208;3 (Ln = YIII, YbIII, NdIII, ErIII). Relaxed structures of YRu&#8208;3 in the ground and the excited electronic states have been calculated using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory methods. Detailed photophysical studies of LnRu&#8208;3 have demonstrated that characteristic emission signals of YbIII, NdIII and ErIII in the NIR&#8208;II range can be sensitized upon excitation in the visible range through RuII&#8208;centered metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) states. We have also showed that these NIR&#8208;II signals are unambiguously detected in an imaging experiment using capillaries and biological tissue&#8208;mimicking phantoms. This work opens unprecedented perspectives for NIR&#8208;II multiplex imaging using LnIII&#8208;based molecular compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Triple Regulations via Fe Redox Boosting Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) has promising prospects for green synthesis of ammonia and environmental remediation. However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3&#8208;) to nitrite (NO2&#8208;) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two&#8208;step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low&#8208;valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3&#8208;RR performance at industrial current density. The existence of low&#8208;valence Fe species bypasses the NO3&#8208; to NO2&#8208; step through the spontaneous redox with NO3&#8208; to produce NO2&#8208; and Fe2O3, regulates the electronic structure of Ni2P to reduce the barrier of NO2&#8208; to NH3, thirdly prohibits the hydrogen evolution by consuming the excess active hydrogen through reduction of Fe2O3 to recover low&#8208;valence Fe species. The triple regulations via Fe redox during the two&#8208;step relay reactions guarantee the Fe&#8208;Ni2P@NF high ammonia yield of 120.1 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 with Faraday efficiency of more than 90% over a wide potential window and a long&#8208;term stability of more than 130 h at ~1000 mA cm&#8208;2. This work provides a new strategy to realize the design and synthesis of nitrate reduction electrocatalysts at high current densities.</dc:description>

However, the performance of catalysts at high current density usually suffers from the high energy barrier for the nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite (NO2-) and the competitive hydrogen evolution. Herein, we proposed a two-step relay mechanism through spontaneous redox reaction followed electrochemical reaction by introducing low-valence Fe species into Ni2P nanosheets to significantly enhance the NO3-RR performance at industrial current density.

         <title>A Helicene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Molecule Inductor and Capacitor with Frequency&#8208;Dependent Charge&#8208;Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive studies has been explored on single&#8208;molecule switches and rectifiers, the design of single&#8208;molecule inductors has not been explored due to the experimental challenges in the investigation of frequency&#8208;dependent charge transport at the single&#8208;molecule scale. In this study, we synthesized a helicene&#8208;based helical molecular wire and carried out meticulous single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, combined with current&#8208;voltage (IV) studies with varying frequencies using the scanning tunneling microscope break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Our results reveal the formation of a single&#8208;molecule junction and highlight the unique behavior of the molecular wire in response to different alternating current (AC) varying frequencies. The transport of charges occurs selectively either through the coiled backbone of the conjugated helical structure or vertically via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, depending on the frequency of the applied AC. Notably, our investigation demonstrates the functionality of the wire as an inductor at low frequencies, and a capacitor at high frequencies. This work lays the foundation for a systematic approach to designing, fabricating, and implementing single&#8208;molecule logic devices such as inductors and wave filters.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic tuning of microstructure and morphology in carbon molecular sieve hollow fibers for propylene/propane separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric carbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fiber membranes with tunable micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structural morphologies for energy efficient propylene&#8208;propane separation are reported here.&#160; A sub&#8208;glass transition temperature (sub&#8208;Tg) thermal oxidative crosslinking strategy enables simultaneous optimization of the intrinsic molecular sieving properties while also reducing the thickness of the CMS &#8220;skin&#8221; derived from the 6FDA:BPDA/DAM polyimide precursors. Such synergistic tuning of CMS microstructure and macroscopic morphology of CMS hollow fibers enables significantly increased propylene permeance (reaching 186.5 GPU) while maintaining an appealing propylene/propane selectivity of 13.3 for 50/50 propylene/propane mixed gas feeds. Our findings reveal a more refined and versatile tool than available with previous O2&#8208;doping pretreatments. The advanced approach here should be broadly useful to other polyimide precursors and diverse gas pairs.</dc:description>

         <title>Propane Dehydrogenation on PtxZny Active Sites in Silicalite&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has progressed by recent investigations that have identified Zn as a promising promoter for Pt subnanometer catalysts. It is desirable to gain insights into the structure, stability, and activity of such active sites and the factors that influence them, such as Zn:Pt ratio, Pt coordination and nuclearity. Here, we employ density functional theory and microkinetic simulations to investigate the stability of PtxZny (x=1&#8208;3, y=0&#8208;3) active sites grafted on silanols of Silicalite&#8208;1 and the PDH activity of Pt. We find that the coordination of a Pt atom to a nest of grafted Zn(II) atoms increases the stability of the Pt1Zny sites, whose activity is similar for y=0&#8208;2 and drops dramatically for y&gt;2. We further demonstrate, via linear scaling relations and microkinetic simulations, that the turnover frequency obeys a volcano law as a function of propylene binding strength. The Pt2Zn1 and Pt3Zn1 sites are stable and exhibit activity similar to Pt1Zn2, but only Pt1Zn2 manifests reaction kinetics consistent with experimental data, strongly suggesting the active site composition in the synthesized catalyst samples. The methodology presented here suggests a general strategy for deducing active site information such as composition through simple kinetic experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst&#8217;s electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is widely applied in optical data storage, quantum computing and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. Carbon dots (CDs) exhibit competitive optical properties, in addition to excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical&#8208;bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. Here, oriented assembly was driven by hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participated in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs formed multi&#8208;hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfered with optical dynamics of exciton radiation transition and promoted the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands successfully overcame the frequent phenomenon of aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and contributed further to the formation of self&#8208;supporting films by assembly and facilitated chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL were manipulated by simply regulating the functional groups on the ligands. Finally, based on the stable chiral powder phosphors, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes were constructed which provide feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese Carbodiimide (MnNCN): A New Heterogeneous Mn Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of Nitriles from Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant manganese oxides (MnOx) were competitive candidates when screening catalysts for ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles due to their redox property. However, over&#8208;oxidation and possible acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles into amides still limited the application of MnOx in nitrile synthesis. In this work, manganese carbodiimide (MnNCN) was first reported to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and the hydrolysis. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including the ammoxidation of primary alcohols into nitriles, the oxidative C&#8208;C bonds cleavage and ammoxidation of secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, and diols into nitriles. Controlled experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of MnNCN originated from its high ability in the activation of O2 molecules, and favorable oxidative dehydrogenation of C=N bonds in the aldimine intermediates (RCH=NH) into nitriles, inhibiting the competitive side reaction of the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, followed to amide byproducts. Moreover, the hydrolysis of nitriles was also inhibited over MnNCN for its weak acidity as compared with MnOx. This study provided new insights into Mn&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidations as a highly important complement to manganese oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Approach for Accessing 3D Heterocycles via 1,2&#8208;Dicyanation of Planar N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic frameworks is a key challenge in contemporary medicinal chemistry. The molecules with three&#8208;dimensional complexity hold a greater probability to improve clinical outcomes, solubility, selectivity for target proteins, and metabolic stability. However, the prevalence of flat molecules persists among new drug candidates, primarily owing to the multitude of chemical methods available for their synthesis. In principle, the dearomative functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene allows for the conversion of readily available planar molecules into partially or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are most significant structural motifs of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Unfortunately, these reactions are very rare because of the inherent challenge imposed by heteroarenes&#8217; poor reactivity, rendering the process thermodynamically unfavorable. Herein, we report a modular approach for accessing 3D chemical space in translating planar heteroarenes into valuable 3D heterocycles via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector. This approach is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive, non&#8208;symmetric iodane by combining cyanide anion and bench&#8208;stable PhI(OAc)2. This reaction represents a rare example of 1,2&#8208;dicyanation of N&#8208;heteroarenes that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug and agrochemical discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Confined Organic Butterfly&#8208;Molecule with High Photoluminescence Efficiency, Deep&#8208;Blue Amplified Spontaneous Emission, and Unique Piezochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic fluorophores with tunable &#960;&#8208;conjugated paths have attracted considerable attention owing to their diverse properties and promising applications. Herein, we present a tailored butterfly like molecule, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(2,5&#8208;bis (2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)dinaphtha&#8208;lene (BDVPN), which exhibits diverse photophysical features in its two polymorphs. The BP phase crystal, with its &#8220;aligned wings&#8221; conformation, possesses emissive characteristics that are nearly identical to those in dilute solutions. In contrast, the BN phase crystal, which adopts an &#8220;orthogonal wings&#8221; conformation, exhibits an unusual hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission compared to its dilute solution counterparts. This intriguing hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission originates from the reduction in the effective conjugated length of the molecular skeleton. Notably, BN phase crystals also exhibit exceptional optical performance, featuring high&#8208;efficiency emission (76.6%), low&#8208;loss optical waveguides (0.571 dB mm&#8208;1), deep&#8208;blue amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM: 6.4 nm), and a unique 200 nm bathochromic shift of piezochromic luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Induced by Mercury Ions through Binaphthyl Dopants' Conjugation Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials based on cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms show great promise for applications in information encryption and anticounterfeiting. In this study, we constructed a mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL system in CLCs by controlling the conjugation degree of axially chiral binaphthyl derivatives. Two chiral binaphthyl derivatives (R/S&#8208;1 and R/S&#8208;2) were initially used as chiral dopants to demonstrate that CPL inversion (glum values from 0.5/&#8208;0.44 to &#8208;0.53/0.48) in CLCs could be achieved by modulating the conjugation degree of the chiral binaphthyls. Based on this concept, the thioacetal binaphthyl R&#8208;2S was developed and used as a mercury&#8208;responsive chiral dopant in CLCs. Under Hg ion treatment, the CPL sign inverted (glum value changed from 0.22 to &#8208;0.29) due to the transformation of the thioacetal into an aldehyde group. Additionally, the mercury ion&#8208;responsive CPL material was applied in information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Imaging of Renin Activity using Fluorogenic Nanoprobes for Precision Antihypertensive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life&#8208;threatening hypertension remains inadequately controlled in clinics due to its heterogenous renin levels. Rapid stratification of hypertension through renin analysis is crucial for effective personalized treatment, yet an ultrasensitive detection approach is currently lacking. Here, we report activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) for non&#8208;invasive and ultrasensitive profiling of renin activity and guiding antihypertensive treatment decision through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis. ARNs are intrinsically non&#8208;fluorescent due to NIRF reporter connected to a gold nanocluster through a renin&#8208;responsive peptide. In hyperreninemia mouse models, ARNs specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter for accurate renin detection that outperforms the gold standard radioimmunoassay. Such specific and sensitive detection also enables imaging&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening of antihypertensive drugs. In hypertensive rat models, ARNs enable ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate (90% versus 58%).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Life-threatening hypertension remains inadequately controlled in clinics due to its heterogenous renin levels. Rapid stratification of hypertension through renin analysis is crucial for effective personalized treatment, yet an ultrasensitive detection approach is currently lacking. Here, we report activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) for non-invasive and ultrasensitive profiling of renin activity and guiding antihypertensive treatment decision through near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis. ARNs are intrinsically non-fluorescent due to NIRF reporter connected to a gold nanocluster through a renin-responsive peptide. In hyperreninemia mouse models, ARNs specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter for accurate renin detection that outperforms the gold standard radioimmunoassay.

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo&#8208;trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized &#945;&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF3&#8722; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF3&#8722; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.







Abstract
A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.

A photoinduced and electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex&#8208;mediated three&#8208;component C(sp3)&#8722;H bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;arylation of glycine derivatives was developed. This protocol demonstrated efficacy in synthesizing diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporating 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP motifs and enabled the late&#8208;stage integration of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCPs into peptides, applicable to both liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions.







Abstract
The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.

         <dc:description>
The novel designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst has been presented for the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. The new bifunctional catalyst, which combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator, significantly enhances efficiencies and stereoselectivities compared to conventional catalysts. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The electrooxidation of diverse phenols enables the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies by control experiments and cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrate possible reaction pathways and the origin of enantio&#8208;induction.

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal&#8208;free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr2/TPMA resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca carbon dots confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu2+ (9&#8197;ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

Regulating the crystal surface energy and optimizing the crystallization dynamics realized blade&#8208;coating of (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for 24.16&#8201;% efficient inverted perovskite solar cells with extended lifespan.







Abstract
Photoactive black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites during film formation. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8722;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42&#8201;%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Benefited from multifaceted advantages of promoted charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, the resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16&#8201;% (~26.5&#8201;% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) with 15&#8201;% CO2/5&#8201;% O2/80&#8201;% N2 gas mixture and achieve 11&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgBr2 and 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgCl2 compared to 15&#8201;% CO2/85&#8201;% N2 gas mixture. A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.







Abstract
We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr2 (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl2 (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen.

A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8211;20&#8201;% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100&#8197;cycles of operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular electrostatic stabilization in zwitterionic moieties plays a critical role in their reactive stability. The stabilization potential is demonstrated to have a unique spatial orientation dependence in zwitterionic head groups of surfactants and lipids. This feature has been used to generate triggerable supramolecular assembly formation and their disassembly.







Abstract
The consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid head groups. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;Decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven green syngas production from natural lignin and water is achieved over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires supported by a silicon substrate. Photo&#8208;excited charges play a critical role in the generation of &#8901;CH3 from lignin and &#8901;OH from water, followed by the formation of syngas. The study shows a promising route for the carbon&#8208;neutral production of transportation fuels and valuable chemicals beyond fossil fuels.







Abstract
Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. The spectroscopic characterizations, isotope, and model compound experiments, as well as density function theory calculation, disclose that among a variety of groups including aromatic ring, &#8722;OH, &#8722;OCH3, &#8722;C3H7 with complex chemical bonds of O&#8722;H, C&#8722;H, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, etc., InGaN nanowires are cooperative with Pt for preferably breaking the C&#8722;O bond of the rich O&#8722;CH3 group in lignin to liberating &#8901;CH3 by photogenerated holes with a minimum dissociation energy of 2.33&#8197;eV. Syngas are subsequently yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches 43.4&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543&#8197;mol syngas per mol Pt. Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1&#8201;% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional azure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with a peak external quantum efficiency of more than 16&#8201;%, are developed by optimizing the energy cascade process between low&#8208;dimensional phases, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, through the inclusion of multifunctional molecular additives.







Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6&#8201;% (@ 490&#8197;nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3MLCT&#8594;3MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with cis&#8208;coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between 3MLCT and 3MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.







Abstract
Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth-abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal-centered (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable-temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;cis&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-[Fe(pdmi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with four NHC donors show &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;trans&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-[Fe(pdmi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which leads to a nanosecond &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi-classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two polymorphic copper&#8208;based hybrid halides &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI3] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits multi&#8208;properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase&#8208;matchable SHG effect and outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8722; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8722; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid&#8208;state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X&#8208;ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thienopyrazine&#8208;based organic molecules as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two&#8208;step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx as HTM, the TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7&#8201;% for TP&#8208;MN (1). Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups and NiOx as HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80&#8201;% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#8197;h.

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable &#8220;Pink Box&#8221; Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast coherent multidimensional spectroscopy probes photoinduced dynamics in a covalent perylene diimide (PDI) dimer exhibiting solvent&#8208;controlled on/off excitonic coupling. Excitonic coupling leads to ultrafast excimer formation. The coupling dependent population and vibrationally coherent dynamics in the two cases are measured and discussed in the context of controlling PDI dimer photophysics.







Abstract
Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300&#8197;fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.

The partitioned cavity of cage 1 demonstrates a high degree of molecular&#8208;specific recognition, enabling its application not only in the separation of adamantane derivatives but also in the progressive separation of multi&#8208;component polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the reversible binding between the redox&#8208;active guest and 1 is achieved through precise regulation of the reduction/oxidation state of the guest via electrochemical stimulation.







Abstract
The concept of pore space partition has emerged as an effective strategy for developing improved coordination&#8208;based supramolecular porous materials with exceptional performance. Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the influence of cavity&#8208;partitioned cage 1 on the electrochemical properties of redox&#8208;active molecules and electrochemically driven reversible host&#8211;guest process has also been demonstrated. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and development of new type of materials with controlled phase separation and tailored electrochemical properties.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization Induced by Ferromagnetic Sulfur doped C3N4 Triggers Selective H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

Sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) catalyst causes the in&#8208;plane electronic perturbations, further inducing stronger electron delocalization state on carbon sites, which breaks the *C&#8722;O bond and involves the faster desorption of the key reaction intermediate *OOH on the metal surface to form the final product H2O2.







Abstract
For the 2D metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, the atomic coplanar architecture enables a large number of pz orbitals to overlap laterally, thus forming &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and the delocalization degree of the central atom dominates the catalytic activity. Herein, designing sulfur&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) materials as a model, we propose a strategy to promote localized electron polarization by enhancing the ferromagnetism of ultra&#8208;thin 2D carbon nitride nanosheets. The introduction of sulfur (S) further promotes localized ferromagnetic coupling, thereby inducing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and accelerating the electron interface transport. Meanwhile, the hybridization of sulfur atoms breaks the symmetry and integrity of the unit structure, promotes electron enrichment and stimulating electron delocalization at the active site. This optimization enhances the *OOH desorption, providing a favorable kinetic pathway for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Consequently, S&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits high selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and achieves a superb H2O2 production rate, approaching 4374.8&#8197;ppm during continuous electrolysis over 300&#8197;hour. According to theoretical calculation and in situ spectroscopy, the ortho&#8208;S configuration can provide ferromagnetic perturbation in carbon active centers, leading to the electron delocalization, which optimizes the OOH* adsorption during the catalytic process.

17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane diterpenoids include two categories, Cephalotaxus troponoids and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, which possess polycyclic frameworks with seven&#8208;membered A ring bearing different oxidation states. We report herein a novel ynol&#8208;diene cyclization as a rapid access to tropone unit. Combining with a bioinspired stereoselective dual hydrogenation, the first divergent strategy to both categories of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids has been successfully established, which enabled the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus troponoids, (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F and (+)&#8208;harringtonolide, and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;fortalpinoids M/N/P and analog (&#8722;)&#8208;20&#8208;deoxocephinoid P, in 14&#8211;17 linear longest steps starting from commercially available materials.

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenamides are demonstrated as a peptide modification tool that enables late&#8208;stage access to chemically diverse bioactive lipopeptides prepared by semisynthesis and to &#946;&#8208;keto amide&#8208;functionalised peptides, which serve as versatile building blocks for further derivatisation.







Abstract
Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semisynthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22&#8197;lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Multichannel Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the origins of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane. This approach enabled elucidation of the chiroptical signals originating from either the topological or Euclidean chirality in these chiral molecules.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) are promising platforms for developing functionalized artificial molecular machines.

&lt;p&gt;Time-resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the origins of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission in pyrene-functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (BiSAs) loaded TiO2. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 (911.87&#177;5&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gBi&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8722;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8722;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical. The BiSAs sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the nucleophilic attack of &#8901;NH2 radical on the &#8901;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8722;N bond formation. This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8722;N coupling mechanism and offers an intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8722;N compounds.

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system play a central role in host defense and in the modulation of immune responses in infection, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Of the PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLR) are particularly important targets for the development of immunotherapies in a variety of inflammatory and oncological settings. TLR4&#8208;specific carbohydrate&#8208;based biomolecules capable of potently activating cellular responses or inhibiting TLR4&#8208;mediated inflammation were designed, chemically synthesised and immunobiologically evaluated.







Abstract
Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.

An endoperoxide compound (E5) spontaneously deliver three active agents and target multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone. In addition, triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is an important issue in many refractory cancers.







Abstract
We report an endoperoxide compound (E5) which can deliver three therapeutic components by a thermal cycloreversion, namely, singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (P5), thus targeting multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In aqueous environment, E5 undergoes clean reaction to afford three therapeutic components with a half&#8208;life of 8.3&#8197;hours without the generation of other by&#8208;products, which not only achieves good cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells and decreases the levels of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) protein, but also inhibits the transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) induced fibrosis in vitro. In vivo experiments also demonstrated the efficacy of E5 in inhibiting tumor growth and relieving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while exhibiting good biocompatibility. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone for these two lung diseases, and triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is a critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT). Unlike other combination therapies, in which multiple therapeutic agents are given in independent formulations, our work demonstrates single molecule endoperoxide prodrugs could be developed as new platforms for treatment of cancers and related diseases.

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>

A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

&lt;p&gt;A machine-learning approach is used to derive a non-classical model that describes the crystallization of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF-5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO2RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.







Abstract
Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;Catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboranes are disclosed to generate highly stable CB@AuNPs of core&#8208;satellite structures. They are capable of suppressing active species dissolution under harsh conditions and have realized regioselective bromination of unbiased arenes with p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities comparable if not superior to those in the best selective non&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems.







Abstract
Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111)=&#8722;2.90&#8197;eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8722;C bonds combined with B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8722;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110&#8201;&#176;C, pH=1&#8211;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt;30&#8201;:&#8201;1), bromobenzene (15&#8201;:&#8201;1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via a Heterogenous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A heterogeneous gallium(III) catalyst drives the sugar transformation reaction by visible light with turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 1500, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) catalyst.







Abstract
Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogeneous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143&#8197;times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON) of the heterogeneous gallium(III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was ca. two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8212;Coinage&#8208;Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>

Coinage&#8208;metal hydrides or Lewis acidic cationic hydrosilane&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes? The synthesis and characterization of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes are reported. These can catalyze carbonyl hydrosilylation without the addition of an external base. Mechanistic control experiments and DFT calculations reveal a new mechanism in which the coinage&#8208;metal&#8211;alkoxides act as the key intermediates.







Abstract
The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate (ortho&#8208;silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8722;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.

         <dc:description>
A series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams are presented. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners.







Abstract
Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy is developed for firmly growing a variety of transition metal&#8208;coordinated polymer catalysts on diverse substrates. An exemplified NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) with Ni/Fe&#8722;N4 coordination structure transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution, which exhibits remarkable activity and stability in alkaline seawater due to the electronic structure modulation, metal anchoring effect and strong substrate adhesion.







Abstract
Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP=polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000&#8197;h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

A highly efficient and tunable ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2O is presented, where the plasma activates inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species reacting with the confined H2O molecules in porous MOF reactors with various compositions and structures.







Abstract
While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8722;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye&#8208;Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp; Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer film with unique multiple chirality inversion properties has been efficiently prepared, based on a newly&#8208;designed pH&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, etc) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record five switchable chiral states and good reversibility.







Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, etc. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly&#8208;designed acid &amp; base&#8208;sensitive dye&#8208;grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, etc.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp; base&#8208;driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three&#8208;state switching) and good reversibility.

     alt="Multiple Chirality Switching of a Dye-Grafted Helical Polymer Film Driven by Acid &amp;amp; Base"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel polymer film with unique multiple chirality inversion properties has been efficiently prepared, based on a newly-designed pH-sensitive dye-grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, etc) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp;amp; base-driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record five switchable chiral states and good reversibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stimuli-responsive multiple chirality switching material, which can regulate opposed chiral absorption characteristics, has great application value in the fields of optical modulation, information storage and encryption, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;. However, due to the rareness of effective functional systems and the complexity of material structures, developing this type of material remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, a smart polymer film with multiple chirality inversion properties was fabricated efficiently based on a newly-designed acid &amp;amp; base-sensitive dye-grafted helical polymer. Benefited from the cooperative effects of various weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;.) under the aggregated state, this polymer film exhibited a promising acid &amp;amp; base-driven multiple chirality inversion property containing record switchable chiral states (up to five while the solution showed three-state switching) and good reversibility. The creative exploration of such a multiple chirality switching material can not only promote the application progress of current chiroptical regulation technology, but also provide a significant guidance for the design and synthesis of future smart chiroptical switching materials and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering Regulation Achieving Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

F&#8208;substitution achieves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and multipolar axis multiferroicity and enhances the Tc 94&#8197;K in rare&#8208;earth hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric with CPL response. It reveals that F&#8208;substitution is a powerful approach to controlling the performances of ferroic materials and providing new prospects for applications in next&#8208;generation ferroelectric micro&#8208;nano devices.







Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is a highly desired property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for application in vertical sandwich&#8208;type photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite great advances that have been made in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized in the 2D hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric family. Here, from our previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite HQERN ((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution on organic component to successfully obtain FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ=S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium) showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis ferroelectric HQERN, FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity but also realizes out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of 94&#8197;K. This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy. Our study demonstrates that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving more possibility of 2D ferroelectric materials for applications in micro&#8208;nano optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance strategy has been proposed to modulate the closed pores formation of polymer&#8208;derived hard carbon (HC). Sterically hindered groups with aromatic ring are crucial to enhance the rigidity and internal free volumes of polymer, which could suppress the polymer rearrangements and induce the formation of close pores. Moreover, the fabricated HC anode exhibit excellent Na+ storage capacity and fast Na+ transport for sodium&#8208;ion battery.







Abstract
The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;C, improved rate performance (210.7&#8197;mAh/g at 5&#8197;C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Rechargeable &#8220;Rocking Chair&#8221; Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type aqueous Zn&#8722;CO2 battery was designed with Zn2+ cations shuttling between the cathode and anode in a single compartment. A weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (ZnOTf)2 aqueous electrolyte was introduced to inhibit interfacial side reactions on the Zn anode and facilitate uniform Zn plating. Experimental results confirm a novel reaction pathway of the reversible formation and decomposition for ZnCO3 and carbon discharge products.







Abstract
Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a &#8220;rocking chair&#8221; Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with an enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Atomic Level&#8208;Macroscopic Structure&#8208;Activity of Inhomogeneous Localized Aggregates Enabled Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Hybrid Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micelle&#8208;like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic&#8208;enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co&#8208;solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt&#8208;water&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic&#8208;level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;A novel micelle-like structure electrolyte in macroscopic activity is proposed, featuring organic-enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates. Enabled by low donor number co-solvents and amphiphilic anions, this electrolyte offers exceptional solubility, wide electrochemical window, low viscosity, and state-of-the-art ultra-low temperature (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) zinc ion conductivity in aqueous batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utilization of hybrid aqueous electrolytes has significantly broadened the electrochemical and temperature ranges of aqueous batteries, such as aqueous zinc and lithium-ion batteries, but the design principles for extreme operating conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically unveil the ternary interaction involving salt-water-organic co-solvents and its intricate impacts on both the atomic-level and macroscopic structural features of the hybrid electrolytes. This highlights a distinct category of micelle-like structure electrolytes featuring organic-enriched phases and nanosized aqueous electrolyte aggregates, enabled by appropriate low donor number co-solvents and amphiphilic anions. Remarkably, the electrolyte enables exceptional high solubility, accommodating up to 29.8&#8197;m zinc triflate within aqueous micelles. This configuration maintains an intra-micellar salt-in-water setup, allowing for a broad electrochemical window (up to 3.86&#8197;V), low viscosity, and state-of-the-art ultralow-temperature zinc ion conductivity (1.58&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C). Building upon the unique nature of the inhomogeneous localized aggregates, this micelle-like electrolyte facilitates dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping, even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled Zn||PANI battery showcases an impressive capacity of 71.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an extended lifespan of over 3000 cycles at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C. This study opens up a promising approach in electrolyte design that transcends conventional local atomic solvation structures, broadening the water-in-salt electrolyte concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Frameworks with Controlled and Uniform Pore Apertures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three&#8208;arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) was developed as a functional polymer coating for Zn, enhancing the cycling stability of the Zn anode and accelerating the storage rate of photogenerated charges. This enabled the fabricated photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries to achieve a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.

         <title>Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings Engineered via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;phenolic network interfacial strategy is developed to form crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on diverse particle and planar substrates. This strategy allows for customized physicochemical properties (e.g., thickness, and morphology) of the supported crystalline MOFs, with potential for biomedical, agricultural, and energy applications.







Abstract
Crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered extensive attention owing to their highly ordered porous structure and physicochemical properties. However, their practical application often requires their integration with various substrates, which is challenging because of their weakly adhesive nature and the diversity of substrates that exhibit different properties. Herein, we report the use of amorphous metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings to facilitate the growth of crystalline MOF coatings on various particle and planar substrates. Crystalline MOFs with different metal ions and morphologies were successfully deposited on substrates (13 types) of varying sizes, shapes, and surface chemistries. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the coated crystalline MOFs (e.g., composition, thickness) could be tuned using different synthesis conditions. The engineered MOF&#8208;coated membranes demonstrated excellent liquid and gas separation performance, exhibiting a high H2 permeance of 63200&#8197;GPU and a H2/CH4 selectivity of 10.19, likely attributable to the thin nature of the coating (~180&#8197;nm). Considering the vast array of MOFs available (&gt;90,000) and the diversity of substrates, this work is expected to pave the way for creating a wide range of MOF composites and coatings with potential applications in diverse fields.

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, enabling the efficient generation of gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates.







Abstract
The design of various cycloaddition/annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges in the development of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropane chemistry. In this work, a new class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates starting from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, while other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself can also successfully act as a hydride anion donor, which allows the ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered carbocycles has been developed.

     alt="Formal High-Order Cycloadditions of Donor-Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new class of formal high-order [6+n]-cycloaddition and annulation processes of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activation conditions, enabling the efficient generation of gallium 1,2-zwitterionic or 1,3-zwitterionic intermediates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of various cycloaddition/annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges in the development of donor-acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropane chemistry. In this work, a new class of formal high-order [6+n]-cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was studied in detail under GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2-zwitterionic complexes or 1,3-zwitterionic intermediates starting from D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, while other Lewis acids are ineffective and non-selective. New examples of formal [6+2]-, [6+3]-, [6+4]-, [6+1]-, and [4+2]-cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself can also successfully act as a hydride anion donor, which allows the ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven-membered carbocycles has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Catalysis of Encapsulated Platinum Nanoparticles by Pore Wall Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pt nanoparticles are incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with engineered thioether groups on the pore walls, enabling tailored Pt electronic states and accessible Pt sites. Significantly, the optimized Pt@COF&#8208;S0.5 with electron&#8208;deficient Pt NPs in ~1&#8197;nm sizes and high accessible Pt sites exhibit excellent activity and almost absolute selectivity to targeted p&#8208;chloroaniline in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene.







Abstract
While supported metal nanoparticles (NPs) have shown significant promise in heterogeneous catalysis, precise control over their interaction with the support, which profoundly impacts their catalytic performance, remains a significant challenge. In this study, Pt NPs are incorporated into thioether&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (denoted COF&#8208;Sx), enabling precise control over the size and electronic state of Pt NPs by adjusting the thioether density dangling on the COF pore walls. Notably, the resulting Pt@COF&#8208;Sx demonstrate exceptional selectivity (&gt; 99&#8201;%) in catalytic hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene to p&#8208;chloroaniline, in sharp contrast to the poor selectivity of Pt NPs embedded in thioether&#8208;free COFs. Furthermore, the conversion over Pt@COF&#8208;Sx exhibits a volcano&#8208;type curve as the thioether density increases, due to the corresponding change of accessible Pt sites. This work provides an effective approach to regulating the catalysis of metal NPs via their microenvironment modulation, with the aid of rational design and precise tailoring of support structure.

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;Driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;Capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin derivatives introduced by electron&#8208;donating groups (EDG) and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) present the effect of functional groups on varying the electronic structure of porphyrin derivatives, which changes the redox potential and electrochemical energy storage performance. EWG can increase redox potential, while EDG reduces the redox potential. Due to the increasing electron density, EDG can improve Faradaic electrochemical reaction and de/adsorption capacitance contribution of porphyrin macrocycle, which is beneficial to improve the energy storage.







Abstract
Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.

         <title>A Hexaarylbiimidazole&#8208;Terarylene Hybrid: Visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II Absorption via Sequential Photochromic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photochromic molecule that consists of HABI and terarylene exhibits the sequential four&#8208;state photochromism. The delocalization of a &#960;&#8208;electron spin on the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system of the terarylene unit is crucially efficient in increasing the photosensitivity to NIR&#8208;II light. A recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer.







Abstract
A synergetic interaction between two or more photochromic chromophores has a potential to achieve advanced photochemical properties beyond conventional photochromic molecules and to realize photochemical control of complex systems using only a single molecule. Herein, we report a hybrid photochromic molecule consisting of hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) and terarylene that exhibits multi&#8208;state photochromism. The biphotochrome hybrid shows four&#8208;state photochromic reaction involving sequentially proceeding photoreactions. The UV or visible light irradiation to the biphotochrome leads to the C&#8722;N bond breaking reaction of the HABI in preference to the ring&#8208;closing reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron system in the terarylene unit, leading to two terarylene radical molecules. The photogenerated terarylene radical further exhibits the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization reaction by UV irradiation. The delocalized &#960;&#8208;radical on the closed&#8208;ring form of the terarylene is efficient to enhance the photosensitivity to the NIR&#8722;I and &#8208;II region. Furthermore, a recombination reaction of radicals between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers of terarylene affords an unprecedented photochromic dimer as a structural isomer of the initial molecule. This is a consequence of the sequential hybrid photochromic system involving the HABI and terarylene units.

         <title>Fe&#8722;O4 Motif Activated Graphitic Carbon via Oxo&#8208;Bridge for Highly Selective H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
The Fe&#8722;O4 motif embedded carbon material catalyzes oxygen reduction reaction via two electron pathway (2e ORR) to achieve a record&#8208;high H2O2 production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with exceptional selectivity at a high current density, thanks to the carbon reaction sites activated by the well&#8208;defined Fe&#8722;O4 motif via oxo&#8208;bridges and the highly graphitized carbon substrate.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based materials have been utilized as effective catalysts for hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR), however the insufficient selectivity and productivity still hindered the further industrial applications. In this work, we report the Fe&#8722;O4 motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti&#8208;poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H2O2 cumulated to 8.6&#8201;% in 24&#8197;h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in situ characterization verified &#945;&#8208;C surrounding the Fe&#8722;O4 motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo&#8208;bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.

In this work, we report the Fe&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; motif activated graphitic carbon material which enabled highly selective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis operating at high current density with excellent anti-poisoning property. In the bulk production test, the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cumulated to 8.6&#8201;% in 24&#8197;h and the corresponding production rate of 33.5&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; outperformed all previously reported materials. Theoretical model backed by in situ characterization verified &#945;-C surrounding the Fe&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; motif as the actual reaction site in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics aspects. The strategy of activating carbon reaction site by metal center via oxo-bridge provides inspiring insights for the rational design of carbon materials for heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy has been used to affect a simple cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated supramolecular heterodimerisation. A further photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition leads to the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane.







Abstract
In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation based on an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Furthermore, the heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system that not only contributes to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriches synthetic methods for mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Variation of Chemical Microenvironment of Pores in Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain engineering approach is proposed to elucidate the impact of pore chemical microenvironment variation on photocatalytic H2O2 production behavior of two hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Comparatively, COF&#8722;O features impeded charge recombination, lowered charge transfer resistance, accelerated interfacial electron transfer and additional reactive sites, leading to an impressive apparent quantum yield of 10.3&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 is an advantageous and ecologically sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving high conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents remains a challenge. In this study, two covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8722;O and COF&#8722;C) were prepared with identical skeletal structures but with their pore walls anchored to different alkyl chains. They were used to investigate the effect of the chemical microenvironment of pores on photocatalytic H2O2 production. Experimental results reveal a change of hydrophilicity in COF&#8722;O, leading to suppressed charge recombination, diminished charge transfer resistance, and accelerated interfacial electron transfer. An apparent quantum yield as high as 10.3&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) can be achieved with H2O and O2 through oxygen reduction reaction. This is among the highest ever reported for polymer photocatalysts. This study may provide a novel avenue for optimizing photocatalytic activity and selectivity in H2O2 generation.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500&#8197;Wh/kg</title>

[Fe(CN)6] vacancies regulation is proposed to achieve high specific capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). And then a novel precipitation conversion synthesis method was designed. The as&#8208;prepared PBAs with hierarchical hollow morphology and [Fe(CN)6] vacancies have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh energy density.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover upon Methane Dissociation on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under real&#8208;world conditions, the frequent collisions of gaseous CH4 molecules on Rh/Cu(111) single&#8208;atom alloy are a key to promote adsorbate spillover, especially for bulky polyatomic CH3* species, providing insights into the effective use of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has a minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by the frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Nitrate Upcycling Mediated by Organonickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed nitrate (NO3&#8722;) upcycling technology has been developed that uses a nickel pincer complex as a bifunctional catalyst to effect sequential deoxygenation followed by C&#8722;N coupling. This approach enables nitrate salts to be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major environmental pollutants and to neutralize this long&#8208;term environmental threat, new catalytic methods are needed. Although there are biological denitrification processes involving four different enzymatic reactions to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into dinitrogen (N2), it is unfortunately difficult to apply in industry due to the complexity of the processes. In particular, nitrate is difficult to functionalize because of its chemical stability. Thus, there is no organometallic catalysis to convert nitrate into useful chemicals. Herein, we present a nickel pincer complex that is effective as a bifunctional catalyst to stepwise deoxygenate NO3&#8722; by carbonylation and further through C&#8722;N coupling. By using this nickel catalysis, nitrate salts can be selectively transformed into various oximes (&gt;20 substrates) with excellent conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the highly inert nitrate ion can be functionalized to produce useful chemicals by a new organonickel catalysis. Our results show that the NOx conversion and utilization (NCU) technology is a successful pathway for environmental restoration coupled with value&#8208;added chemical generation.

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Imaging/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z1 was synthesized and it was encapsulated with F127 polymer to obtain Z1 NPs. They could generate ROS effectively under 808&#8197;nm laser, particularly type I ROS. Moreover, they exhibited good mitochondrial targeting, and induced synergistic pyroptosis and apoptosis for potent tumor therapy. Meanwhile, Z1 NPs demonstrated NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy with minimal adverse effects.







Abstract
Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis of a Metalla[2]catenane, Metallarectangles and Polynuclear Assemblies from Di(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorenone&#8208;bridged di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to give the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4, which disintegrates in DMF into two metallarectangles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. Substitution of the imidazo[1,5a]pyridinium NHC precursors in H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 for imidazolium groups yields di&#8208;NHC precursors H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 which react with Ag2O to yield exclusively metallarectangles of type [Ag2(L)2(PF6)2 with a spacing between the fluorenone planes too small for [2]catenane formation.

The 2,7&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;linked bis(6&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4. The [2]catenane rearranges in DMF to yield two metallamacrocycles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. 2,7&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;(imidazolium) salts H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 (L=2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b) react with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield metallamacrocycles [Ag2(L)2](PF6)2 with interplanar distances between the fluorenone rings too small for [2]catenane formation. Intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the fluorenone groups were observed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The strongly kinked 2,7&#8208;fluorenone bridged bis(5&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to yield [Ag2(4)(CN)](PF6), while the tetranuclear assembly [Ag4(4)2(CO3)](PF6)2 was obtained in the presence of K2CO3.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14, were incorporated with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl chains to induce intrinsic polarizability and piezoelectric properties. Utilizing these two COFs to assemble piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), remarkable output open circuit voltage, short circuit current and stability were produced under the applied force without poling conditions.







Abstract
Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <title>Anionic Chemistry Modulation Enabled Environmental Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc Batteries: The Case of Carbonate Ions</title>

         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes is presented, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property.







Abstract
Anionic chemistry modulation represents a promising avenue to enhance the electrochemical performance and unlock versatile applications in cutting&#8208;edge energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a methodology that involves anionic chemistry of carbonate anions to tailor the electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction reactions of bismuth (Bi) electrodes, where the conversion energy barrier for Bi (0) to Bi (III) has been significantly reduced, endowing anionic full batteries with enhanced electrochemical kinetics and chemical self&#8208;charging property. The elaborately designed batteries with an air&#8208;switch demonstrate rapid self&#8208;recharging capabilities, recovering over 80&#8201;% of the electrochemical full charging capacity within a remarkably short timeframe of 1&#8197;hour and achieving a cumulative self&#8208;charging capacity of 5&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1. The aqueous self&#8208;charging battery strategy induced by carbonate anion, as proposed in this study, holds the potential for extending to various anionic systems, including seawater&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion batteries. This work offers a universal framework for advancing next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;functional power sources.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The forest , a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo&#8208;ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article (e202402915), Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose&#8208;based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo&#8208;ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

Supramolecular hetero&#8208;self&#8208;assembly is more challenging and meaningful compared to homo&#8208;self&#8208;assembly in many areas. In their Research Article (e202410130), Xu&#8208;Man Chen, Hong Yang, Quan Li et&#8197;al. present a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerization, which enables the occurrence of a rare cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated [2+2] heterocycloaddition under UV irradiation. The final product is found to be an unexpected [2]rotaxane, developing into a novel photochemical template synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Back Cover: Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper provides a comprehensively review of nanozymes targeting organic substrates, discusses the strategies for efficient identification of new nanozymes, and proposes a novel paradigm for constructing nano&#8208;organelles.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe3O4), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H2O2, oxygen, and O2&#8722;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward&#8208;looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano&#8208;organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano&#8208;organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Coupled Electron&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Transfer Processes at a Liquid/Liquid Interface Decorated with Photoactive Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>

The electron transfer and ion transfer reactions at self&#8208;assembled BiVO4 particles at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface could be disentangled by the combined use of micropipettes and microelectrodes to detect the products. The rates of all processes could be modulated by an external Galvani potential difference across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
The influence of the ion transfer on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions was studied on the surface of hyperbranched semiconducting BiVO4 particles spontaneously adsorbed at the liquid&#8208;liquid (L/L) interface between an aqueous LiCl solution and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentaflurophenyl)borate (BATB) in 1,2&#8208;dichlorethane. The organic electrolyte was supplemented with [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3 to accept photoexcited electrons from BiVO4 under formation of the corresponding Co(II) complex. The L/L interface was stabilized at the orifice of a micropipette (MP) and allowed to record ion transfer cyclic voltammetry (ITCV) by applying a Galvani potential difference

         <title>Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. Characteristic ionic current oscillations have been used to evaluate the binding affinity, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles. This finding sheds light on the mechanism of vesicle&#8208;mediated tau spreading and tau pathology.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau participates in neurotransmission regulation via its interaction with synaptic vesicles (SVs). The precise nature and mechanics of tau&#8216;s engagement with SVs, especially regarding alterations in vesicle dynamics, remain a matter of discussion. We report an electrochemical method using a synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette to monitor vesicle dynamics induced by tau. A model vesicle of ~30&#8197;nm is confined within a lipid&#8208;modified nanopipette orifice with a comparable diameter to mimic the synaptic lipid environment. Both tau and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau) present two&#8208;state dynamic behavior in this biomimetic system, showing typical ionic current oscillation, induced by lipid&#8208;tau interaction. The results indicate that p&#8208;tau has a stronger affinity to the lipid vesicles in the confined environment, blocking the vesicle movement to a higher degree. Taken together, this method bridges a gap for sensing synaptic vesicle dynamics in a confined lipid environment, mimicking vesicle movement near the synaptic membrane. These findings contribute to understanding how different types of tau protein regulate synaptic vesicle motility and to underlying its functional and pathological behaviours in disease.

Stochastic sensing of chloride anions has been developed by employing a semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter inside the &#946; barrel of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin pore. When the chloride receptor blocks the protein pore, it inhibits the ionic current through the pore, providing a single&#8208;molecule sensing technology and concomitantly allowing detection of its chloride guest. The kinetic parameters are deduced from the single&#8208;channel recordings in the absence and presence of chloride anions.







Abstract
Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.

Abstract
The one&#8208;step synthesis of tetra&#8208;substituted benzenes was accomplished via gold&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;ene annulation. Distinguished from prior modification methods, this novel strategy undergoes formal [3+3] cyclization, producing polysubstituted benzenes with exceptional efficiency. The critical factor enabling this transformation was the introduction of amides, which were reported for the first time in gold catalysis as covalent nucleophilic co&#8208;catalysts. This interesting protocol not only offers a new strategy to achieve functional benzenes with high efficiency, but also enlightens potential new reaction pathways within gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne activation processes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadienes by Birch Reduction in the Presence of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete change in regioselectivity has been observed during the Birch reduction of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds. Alkyl aldehydes afford exclusively 1,4&#8208;isomers, whereas with ketones and aryl aldehydes, 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are isolated in good yields on a large scale. Such compounds are suitable precursors for further transformations.







Abstract
Birch reductions are well&#8208;known transformations of arenes, applied for large scale synthesis of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Herein, we describe first reactions of benzoic acids in the presence of carbonyl compounds, affording aldol products in moderate to high yields. Alkyl aldehydes give the expected nonconjugated dienes by reaction at the &#945;&#8208;position. Interestingly, the intermediately formed enolate attacks aryl aldehydes and ketones from its &#947;&#8208;position, which can be explained by steric hindrance. This opens the door for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes, which are not accessible by classical Birch reductions. Our method is applicable to benzoic, m&#8208; and p&#8208;toluic acid and various carbonyl compounds, and more than 25 new products were isolated in up to 93&#8201;% yield. Prochiral aryl aldehydes afford diastereomeric mixtures in ratios of about 4&#8201;:&#8201;1, but in the cyclohexadiene ring only trans isomers are formed with high selectivity. Finally, the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are suitable precursors for further transformations, which we have demonstrated in first examples. Thus, aromatization affords products of a formal meta selective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and four new stereocenters were generated by cycloaddition of singlet oxygen with excellent selectivity.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a subsequent cyclization/oxidation process to access inherently chiral calix[4]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Both the large&#8208;scale synthesis and synthetic transformation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based chiral catalysts have demonstrated their potential applications.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are an excellent structural scaffold for enantioselective synthesis, chiral recognition, sensing, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives via cascade enantioselective cyclization and oxidation reactions. The three&#8208;component reaction features a broad substrate scope (33&#8197;examples), high efficiency (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee on average). The potential applications of calix[4]arene derivatives are highlighted by their synthetic transformation and a detailed investigation of their photophysical and chiroptical properties.

         <title>Exploiting trans&#8208;Sulfinylation for the Synthesis of Diverse N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfinamides via Decarboxylative Sulfinamidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trans&#8208;sulfinylation enables the generation of hydrolytically&#8208;sensitive alkyl sulfinylamines in situ from Tr&#8208;NSO and primary amines. We exploit this process alongside alkyl radical generation from carboxylic acids using acridine photocatalysis to prepare a broad selection of N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides from structurally diverse and readily available feedstocks.







Abstract
Combining simple amines with the bench&#8208;stable sulfinylamine Tr&#8208;NSO allows in situ preparation of reactive alkyl sulfinylamines, which when combined with alkyl radicals generated by photocatalytic decarboxylation, provides N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides. The reactions are broad in scope and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups on both the acid and amine components. The sulfinamide products are used to prepare a selection of challenging S(VI) products. The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.

         <title>Deuteration as a General Strategy to Enhance Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isotope effects have been explored for decades and now find entrance into photopharmacology. Simple deuteration of azobenzene photoswitches improves photoswitching quantum yield and macroscopic switching kinetics. This finding is translated to the faster optical control of big potassium ion channels and G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, important players for synaptic transmission and neural communication.







Abstract
Chemical photoswitches have become a widely used approach for the remote control of biological functions with spatiotemporal precision. Several molecular scaffolds have been implemented to improve photoswitch characteristics, ranging from the nature of the photoswitch itself (e.g. azobenzenes, dithienylethenes, hemithioindigo) to fine&#8208;tuning of aromatic units and substituents. Herein, we present deuterated azobenzene photoswitches as a general means of enhancing the performance of photopharmacological molecules. Deuteration can improve azobenzene performance in terms of light sensitivity (higher molar extinction coefficient), photoswitch efficiency (higher photoisomerization quantum yield), and photoswitch kinetics (faster macroscopic rate of photoisomerization) with minimal alteration to the underlying structure of the photopharmacological ligand. We report synthesized deuterated azobenzene&#8208;based ligands for the optimized optical control of ion channel and G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) function in live cells, setting the stage for the straightforward, widespread adoption of this approach.

&lt;p&gt;Isotope effects have been explored for decades and now find entrance into photopharmacology. Simple deuteration of azobenzene photoswitches improves photoswitching quantum yield and macroscopic switching kinetics. This finding is translated to the faster optical control of big potassium ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors, important players for synaptic transmission and neural communication.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Activation and Stereospecific Functionalization of Bis(boronic Esters) Derived from 2&#8208;Alkenes: Construction of Propionates and Other 1,2&#8208;Difunctional Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes can be accomplished by a strategy involving alkene diboration followed by site&#8208;selective activation and copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of the less&#8208;hindered boronic ester. This process allows a broad array of difunctional chiral products to be produced from simple olefin starting materials.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed regioselective activation of bis(boronic esters), followed by functionalization, is reported. A bulky activator is shown to selectively activate the less hindered boronic ester enabling it to undergo stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling to a variety of electrophiles. This steric&#8208;based regioselectivity provides a simple and efficient method to prepare highly functionalized, enantiomerically enriched products starting from simple alkenes.

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8722;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;promoted halogen transfer enables direct benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reactions with alcohols. This new deprotonative C&#8722;H oxidation protocol displays unique synthetic capabilities over alternative mechanistic strategies, including the ability to activate high oxidation potential substrates, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, and precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes.







Abstract
We disclose a benzylic C&#8722;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based methods for C&#8722;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8722;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8722;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecular Bromine Production in Sea&#8208;Salt Aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O without additional potent oxidants is proposed. Under acidic conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ can spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Light can promote this process significantly and promote the release of molecular bromine into the gas phase.







Abstract
Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8722; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate was up to 1.55&#215;1010&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8722; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8722; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production; here, H3O+ facilitates the activation of Br&#8722; by O2, serves as a significant source of atmospheric reactive bromine and exerts a profound impact on the atmospheric oxidation capacity.

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of amide bonds between amino acids in supersaturated aerosol droplets is shown to be possible in the presence of dicyandiamide, a potential prebiotic compound, and intense visible light. The rate of this photochemical reaction is strongly dependent on the microdroplet radius.







Abstract
The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.

         <dc:description>
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The mechanism investigation further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral products.







Abstract
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.

         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>BioLindlar Catalyst: Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Promoted Selective Bioreduction of Cyanoalkynes to Give (Z)&#8208;Cyanoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 39, September 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes are attractive starting materials owing to the wide range of possible chemical transformations of this functional group. The selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;poor alkynes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases to give (Z)&#8208; or (E)&#8208;alkenes is now reported. Preparative biotransformations were performed with total selectivity to give the (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes (isolated in 63&#8211;97&#8201;%&#8201;yield), thus resembling the activity shown by transition&#8208;metal (e.g. Lindlar) catalysts.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of alkenes from alkynes usually requires the use of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Unfortunately, efficient biocatalytic alternatives for this transformation have yet to be discovered. Herein, the selective bioreduction of electron&#8208;deficient alkynes to alkenes catalysed by ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs) is described. Alkynes bearing ketone, aldehyde, ester, and nitrile moieties have been effectively reduced with excellent conversions and stereoselectivities, observing clear trends for the E/Z ratios depending on the nature of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group. In the case of cyanoalkynes, (Z)&#8208;alkenes were obtained as the major product, and the reaction scope was expanded to a wide variety of aromatic substrates (up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion, and Z/E stereoselectivities of up to &gt;99/1). Other alkynes containing aldehyde, ketone, or ester functionalities also proved to be excellent substrates, and interestingly gave the corresponding (E)&#8208;alkenes. Preparative biotransformations were performed on a 0.4&#8197;mmol scale, producing the desired (Z)&#8208;cyanoalkenes with good to excellent isolated yields (63&#8211;97&#8201;%). This novel reactivity has been rationalised through molecular docking by predicting the binding poses of key molecules in the ERED&#8208;pu&#8208;0006 active site.

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8722;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>

An organophosphorus&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles using inorganic sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.







Abstract
An organophosphorus &#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8722; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.

         <title>Effective Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with an Iron&#8208;Xantphos Catalyst: Mechanistic and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings have been widely studied and developed in the last decade, alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling systems with iron remain underdeveloped despite the importance of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds in organic synthesis. A major challenge to the development of these reactions is the current lack of fundamental insight into ligand effects and organoiron intermediates that enable effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl couplings. The current study addresses this longstanding limitation using a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and reactivity studies of alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling with iron&#8208;Xantphos to define the in situ formed iron&#8208;Xantphos intermediates in catalysis. Combined with detailed reactivity studies, the nature of the key mechanistic pathways in catalysis and ligands effects to achieve effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling over competing b&#8208;H elimination pathways are probed. Overall, these foundational studies provide a platform for future bespoke ligand and pre&#8208;catalyst design for alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling methods development with sustainable iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO2 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as the charge&#8208;transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO2, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO2 with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO2. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO2 raises the concentration of (SO3NH2)&#8208; which passivates uncoordinated Pb2+ and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity. Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91%. The devices retained 93.8% of their initial PCEs after 1000 hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement of Vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) to Synthesize Six&#8208;Membered Non&#8208;Conjugated Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) under mild conditions to synthesize non&#8208;conjugated cyclohexenone derivatives, which so far do not have many ways to be accessed. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope with reaction yields up to 98%. This VCBO rearrangement can also be used to access various n/6 (n = 5&#8208;8) bicyclic products efficiently. Furthermore, mechanism of this rearrangement has been investigated using DFT calculations, showing that vinyl group&#8208;assisted cyclobutanone C&#8208;C cleavage is easy with a computed activation free energy of 18.1 kcal/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>Interdependence of Support Wettability &#8208;Electrodeposition Rate &#8208; Sodium Metal&#160;Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6 mAh cm&#8208;2, 0.5&#8208;3 mA cm&#8208;2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AF&#8208;SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8208;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modelling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Acetic acid, a key intermediate compound, is synthesized by oxidization of ethane with H2O2 at 0&#8201;&#176;C at ambient pressure through an integrated thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. The selectivity for producing acetic acid reaches 98.7&#8201;%. The positively charged Pd1 atom with an adsorbed OH group is the site for activating the first C&#8722;H of C2H6 with an energy barrier of only 0.14&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8722;Pd1

/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8722;H instead of C&#8722;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14&#8197;eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7&#8201;%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#8201;&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single&#8208;ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high&#8208;voltage stable in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine&#8208;based linkage to a stable &#945;&#8208;aminonitrile linkage, azanide&#8208;based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high&#8208;voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature. The revealed significance of nitrile functionality and the design of new COF structures with high Li+ transport and high electrochemical stability shed light on a novel approach for the rational design of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8722;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8722;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100&#8197;h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5&#8197;V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

Furthermore, the as-fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH-based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH-based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high-performance aqueous zinc batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organized assembly of fundamental building blocks into intricate molecular architectures remains challenging due to the dynamic building blocks. A general strategy has been developed to synthesize high&#8208;dimensional complex architectures by choosing appropriate anion templates and flexible, non&#8208;planar organic linkers. Further, the complex architecture possesses multifunctions suitable for humidity&#8208;electric power generation.







Abstract
Systematically orchestrating fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8722; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8722; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8722; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8722; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF=Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51&#8197;V and a current density of 77.8&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.
