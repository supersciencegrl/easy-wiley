         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 on Z&#8208;Schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Z&#8208;schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 catalyst is efficient for urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction. It has dual active sites for adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 and the accelerated kinetics for C&#8722;N coupling reaction. The energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is reduced on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4.







Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2 is a sustainable method for urea synthesis under mild conditions. However, high&#8208;yield synthesis of urea is a challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. Herein, we have successfully engineered a Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, for boosting photocatalytic urea synthesis via enhancing the initial CO2 and N2 adsorption step and reducing the energy barrier for the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. A high urea yield of 8054.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, which was significantly higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, with accelerated charge transfer by FeS, not only had dual active sites for the chemical adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2, but also retained the high conduction band (&#8722;1.50&#8197;eV) and accelerated supply of electrons and protons, which are responsible for its good photoreduction activity and significantly reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of C&#8722;N coupling reaction.

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate Diagnosis and Efficient Clearance of Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) is reported for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes. FLAGC is easily drained to sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for precise localization. FLAGC is then specifically lit up by the low pH and over&#8208;expressed myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in an accurate diagnosis of metastatic SLNs by chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window. Further, the tumor was efficiently eradicated through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). Our findings offer a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically positive lymph nodes.







Abstract
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC is easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggers the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes is achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized the stereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of bicyclobutanes via radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, which constitutes a practical method to assemble fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes. It is noteworthy that the covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy achieved diastereoselective radical&#8208;radical cross coupling, with dispersion and electrostatic interactions playing a crucial role in stereoinduction.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.

         <title>Mineralizing Biofilm towards Sustainable Conversion of Plastic Wastes to Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of inorganic materials with biological machinery to convert plastics into fuels offers a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. Herein, we develop a type of hybrid living material via biomineralization of CdS onto Shewanella oneidensis&#8208;based biofilm, which is capable of sustainable hydrogen production from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) wastes under daylight. We reveal that the formed biofilm microstructure provides an independent anaerobic microenvironment that simultaneously supports cellular viability, maintains hydrogenase activity, and preserves the functional stability of CdS, giving rise to the efficient plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 3751 &#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Besides, by genetically engineering transmembrane pili conduit and incorporating conductive nanomaterials to strengthen the electron transfer across cellular interface and biofilm matrices, we show that the conversion efficiency is further enhanced to 5862 &#956;mol H2 g&#8208;1 PLA. Significantly, we exhibit that a long&#8208;term sustainable plastic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion of 63 d could be achieved by periodically replenishing PLA wastes. Overall, by the synergistic integration of biotic&#8208;abiotic characteristics the developed biofilm&#8208;based biomineralized hybrid living material is anticipated to provide a new platform toward the efficient conversion of plastic wastes into valuable fuels, and bridge the gap between environmental contamination and green energy production.</dc:description>

We synthesized high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and three 413&#8208;type phases. The varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes were observed. TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15&#8197;minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54&#8201;%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#8201;&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.

         <title>Hubbard Gap Closure&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Redox Li&#8208;Storage Mechanism as the Origin of Anomalously High Capacity and Fast Ion Diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;Like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism is first decoded as the origin of anomalously high capacity and fast diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;like POM electrode, where enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation, Hubbard gap closure and interlayer conjugated configuration essentially contribute to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and superior cycle stability.







Abstract
MOFs&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POMs) electrodes, harvesting combined advantages of interlocking porosity and multi&#8208;electron transfer reaction, have already emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the origins of the underlying redox mechanism in such materials remain a matter of uncertainty. Of critical challenges are the anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values and the fast ion diffusivity that cannot be satisfactorily comprehended in the theory of crystal lattice. Herein, for the first time we decode t2g electron occupation&#8208;regulated dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism as the true origin of extra capacity in POMs electrodes. The lattice and electronic transition of active centers and reaction intermediates were systematically decoupled through density functional theory (DFT) and a suite of structural spectroscopic investigations, such as X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation by Li coordination significantly triggers the Hubbard gap closure and reversible Li deposition/dissolution at surface region. Conjugated V&#8722;O&#8208;Li configuration at interlayers endow Li+ ion pathways along pore walls as the dominant contribution to the low migration barrier and fast diffusivity. As a result, remarkable cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), extremely high specific capacity (1200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (404&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) were achieved, providing new understandings on the underlying mechanism of POMs electrodes and pivotal guidance for dual&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;Packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship in high mobility emissive materials was revealed that a centroid distance of about 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for achieving high mobility and strong emission in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates simultaneously based on four quinoline&#8208;anthracene isomers. This relationship also demonstrates the broad applicability and universal potential in other organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors. However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8211;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8722;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading highly active metal clusters on a semiconductor nanosheet can enable the introduced metal atom and the metal atom in substrate materials to construct the heteroatom pair sites. Having two different metal atoms on the interface as active sites may effectively accelerate C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 for CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheets, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998&#8197;eV, hinting the easy C&#8722;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

         <title>GlutaR: A High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visualization of the metabolism of glutamine in vivo: Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle. GlutaR, a genetically encoded fluorescence sensor of glutamine, displays excellent selectivity and sensitivity, which enable to report dynamic and precise changes of glutamine levels in cells, live mice, and quantification of free subcellular organelle glutamine concentrations with high spatiotemporal resolution.







Abstract
Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity (R488/405 of ~1000&#8201;%), and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed in situ titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GLS) differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR's ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice in vivo. These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active (FexCoy)5C2 structure is developed through the synergistic effect of electronic (sodium) and structural (cobalt) promoters. This strategy facilitates the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into olefins at a low temperature of 240&#8201;&#176;C, achieving the highest STY of olefins at low temperatures, even better than a significant proportion under high&#8208;temperature operating conditions. Additionally, it retains the capability to synthesize olefins at 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7&#8201;%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2&#8201;%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0&#8201;% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9&#8201;% at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 1000&#8197;mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#8201;&#176;C and 4000&#8197;mL/g/h with more than 25&#8201;% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500&#8197;hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;Component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of L&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of l&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways and double networks of P and M helices were therefore formed, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices. The bipyridine core, phenyl ring, amide unit all adapted into different stacking modes in M&#8208;helices and P&#8208;helices, and energy analysis indicated that the minority M&#8208;helices were more thermodynamically favored products. This study provides an approach to explore synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures by manipulating the multiple assembly pathway.

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the bay region of polyperylene with mono and diimide functional groups has enabled the synthesis of robust graphene nanoribbons. These nanoribbons are solution&#8208;processable and show good NIR absorption and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000&#8197;nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3&#8197;eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Maleimide&#8208;Based Dual Functionalization of Protein N&#8208;Termini</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleimides can target the N&#8208;termini of proteins instead of cysteine by the use of 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde and copper(II) salt under non&#8208;denaturing conditions. The methodology requires no mutagenesis of proteins and enables the high&#8208;yield attachment of various functional groups to proteins with various N&#8208;terminal amino acids through a simple operation using commercially available maleimides.







Abstract
Maleimide derivatives are privileged reagents for chemically modifying proteins through the Michael addition reaction with cysteine due to their selectivity, operational simplicity, and commercial availability. However, since accessible free cysteine is rarely found in natural proteins, it is highly desirable to find alternative targets to enable direct bioconjugation of proteins with maleimides. In this study, we have developed an operationally simple and straightforward method for the N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins without the need for mutagenesis via a copper(II)&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with maleimides and 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PCA) derivatives under non&#8208;denaturing conditions at pH&#8197;6 and 37&#8201;&#176;C in aqueous media. Our method utilizes commercially available maleimides to attach diverse functionalities to various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. We demonstrate the preparation of a ternary protein complex cross&#8208;linked at the N&#8208;termini and dually modified trastuzumab equipped with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic agent, and a Cy5 fluorophore (MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab). MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab retained human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) recognition activity and exerted cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;positive cells. Furthermore, MMAE&#8208;Cy5&#8208;trastuzumab allowed successful visualization of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in mouse tumors. This straightforward method will expand the accessibility of protein conjugates with well&#8208;defined structures in a wide range of research fields.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring in PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 Organic&#8211;inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide via Rigid Benzene Ring Induced Local Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scheme. Schematic illustration of combining organic compunds PMA+ (C7H10N+) with the inorganic [NaCl6]&#8208;[InCl6] layer to form a novel and highly efficient luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide PMA4NaInCl8 (PNIC) with Sb3+ doping. The dual emission of PNIC:Sb3+ can be adjusted from cyan to yellow by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy.







Abstract
Low dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity&#8208;forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88&#8201;% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity&#8208;forbidden transition by strong spin&#8208;orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) interaction. The as&#8208;prepared crystal shows an efficient dual emission peaking 495 and 560&#8197;nm at low temperature, which are ascribed to different levels of 3P1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Sb3+ in [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral caused by JT deformation. Moreover, wide&#8208;range luminescence tailoring from cyan to orange can be achieved through adjusting excitation energy and temperature because of flexible [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedral in the PNIC lattice. Based on a relative stiff lattice environment, the 560&#8197;nm yellow emission under 350&#8197;nm light excitation exhibits abnormal anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 8 to 400&#8197;K owing to the suppression of non&#8208;radiative transition. The multimode luminescence regulation enriches PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 great potential in the field of optoelectronics such as temperature sensing, low temperature anti&#8208;counterfeiting and WLED applications.

         <title>Meso/Microporous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Featuring Curved Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ZnO&#8208;assisted ZIF derivation approach is developed to synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C catalyst with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites onto the tubular carbon walls, showing excellent oxygen reduction performance in both acidic and alkaline media. When used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries, it demonstrates outstanding cell/battery performance.







Abstract
Zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are among the most efficient precursors for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N/C materials, which are promising catalysts for enhancing the performance of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and proton exchange fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, existing ZIF&#8208;derived Fe&#8722;N/C electrocatalysts mostly consist of microporous materials, leading to insufficient mass transport and inadequate battery/cell performance. In this study, we synthesize an atomically dispersed meso/microporous Fe&#8722;N/C material with curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites, denoted as FeSA&#8722;N/TC, through the pyrolysis of hemin&#8208;modified ZIF films on ZnO nanorods, obtained from the self&#8208;assembly reaction between Zn2+ from ZnO hydrolysis and 2&#8208;methylimidazole. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the curved Fe&#8722;N4 active sites can weaken the intermediate adsorptions, resulting in lower free energy barriers and enhanced performance during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, FeSA&#8722;N/TC exhibits exceptional ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.925&#8197;V in alkaline media and 0.825&#8197;V in acidic media. When used as the cathodic catalyst in PEMFCs and ZABs, FeSA&#8722;N/TC achieves high peak power densities (H2&#8722;O2 PEMFC: 1100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; H2&#8722;Air PEMFC: 715&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; liquid&#8208;state ZAB: 228&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2; solid&#8208;state ZAB: 112&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in practical applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Functionalization of Arenes with Vinyl Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of arenes with vinyl cations has been realized, enabling the atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes. This transformation is the first example of the assembly of atropisomeric alkenes via vinyl cations. Notably, the constructed axially chiral skeletons were shown to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Axially chiral tetrasubstituted alkenes are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related areas. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains elusive, owing to the high steric repulsion and relatively low conformational stability. Herein, we disclose the straightforward construction of atropisomeric tetrasubstituted alkenes by effective enantiocontrol in a reaction with vinyl cation intermediates. This copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization of sterically hindered (hetero)arenes with vinyl cations enables the efficient and atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted styrenes and pyrrolyl ethylenes with high atroposelectivities. Importantly, this reaction represents the first example of the assembly of axially chiral alkenes via vinyl cations. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the reaction mechanism, origin of regioselectivity, Z/E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by diverse product derivatizations, chiral organocatalyst synthesis, as well as further applications in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Modulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Phenothiazine Dioxide via External Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External halogen&#8208;&#960; interactions have been demonstrated to be a key feature for the development of ultralong phosphorescent material. A phenothiazine dioxide (DOPTZ) featuring a chloride atom linked through a flexible alkyl chain (DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl) exhibits an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%, the highest values among phenothiazine&#8208;based phosphorescent substances.







Abstract
Developing pure organic materials with ultralong lifetimes and balanced quantum efficiency is attractive but challenging. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to investigate external heavy atoms by linking molecular emitters with halogen through a flexible alkyl chain. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis clearly reveal the halogen C&#8722;X&#8208;&#960; interactions, which can be tuned by halogen donors, as well as the distance and geometry between them. Impressively, DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl featuring a chloride atom as donor, exhibits a balanced long phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%. We also first demonstrate that Cl can induce more positive effect than heavier halogens (Br and I) on prolonging the lifetime. We envisage that the present study will expedite new molecular design to manipulate the room temperature phosphorescence via external heavy atom effect, and highlight a special C&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction for the development of ultralong phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Protein&#8211;Protein Communication for Field&#8208;Deployable Cell&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8211;protein communication (LIRAC) was developed by redefining the connection between transcription factors (TFs) and CRISPR/Cas enzymes that do not have natural interactions. LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into fast activation of CRISPR/Cas enzymes within a homogeneous system, allowing for rapid response, tunable dynamic range, tristate logic, and portable detection.







Abstract
Natural protein&#8211;protein communications, such as those between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerases/ribosomes, underpin cell&#8208;free biosensing systems operating on the transcription/translation (TXTL) paradigm. However, their deployment in field analysis is hampered by the delayed response (hour&#8208;level) and the complex composition of in vitro TXTL systems. For this purpose, we present a de novo&#8208;designed ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8211;protein communication (LIRAC) by redefining the connection between TFs and non&#8208;interacting CRISPR/Cas enzymes. By rationally designing a chimeric DNA adaptor and precisely regulating its binding affinities to both proteins, LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into rapid CRISPR/Cas enzyme activation within a homogeneous system. Consequently, LIRAC obviates the need for RNA/protein biosynthesis inherent to conventional TXTL&#8208;based cell&#8208;free systems, substantially reducing reaction complexity and time (from hours to 10&#8197;minutes) with improved sensitivity and tunable dynamic range. Moreover, LIRAC exhibits excellent versatility and programmability for rapidly and sensitively detecting diverse contaminants, including antibiotics, heavy metal ions, and preservatives. It also enables the creation of a multi&#8208;protein communication&#8208;based tristate logic for the intelligent detection of multiple contaminants. Integrated with portable devices, LIRAC has been proven effective in the field analysis of environmental samples and personal care products, showcasing its potential for environmental and health monitoring.

         <title>Heavy Pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyltriylenes and their Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyltriylenes of gallium, indium and thallium (5CpGa; 5CpIn; 5CpTl) is reported. Their application as ligands in a series of heterobimetallic complexes is demonstrated, including a heterobimetallic polydecker of gallium and lithium.







Abstract
A series of triylenes of the heavy group&#8197;13 elements gallium, indium and thallium, carrying the pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl ligand is reported. The compounds were characterized in solution and in the solid&#8208;state and their donor ligand properties in heterobimetallic complexes were investigated, whereby a series of tungsten carbonyl complexes was isolated. Furthermore, a new synthetic route towards a previously described lithium&#8208;aluminum heterobimetallic dimetallocene is reported, which also enabled the isolation of a heterobimetallic polydecker of lithium and gallium.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Glycerol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring 2D c&#8208;MOFs for Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation Reaction(GOR): This work introduces a novel class of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), M2[NiPcS8] with various metal center based on octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8). Focusing on glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), theoretical and experimental analyses reveal the superior performance of the CoS4 site in Co2[NiPcS8] among the family of 2D c&#8208;MOFs M2(M'PcX8) (M/M&#8217;=Cu/Ni/Co, X=S/O/NH). The electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported by carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which contributes to excellent overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27&#8197;V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR.







Abstract
Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. In this study, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27&#8197;V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.

         <title>Unconventional Near&#8208;Equilibrium Nucleation of Graphene on Si&#8208;Terminated SiC(0001) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface is elucidated. The stable carbon clusters, preferential nucleation sites and nucleation pathways are revealed, and a nucleation diagram is established. Contradictory experimental observations on graphene growth on SiC(0001) surface are explained. Nucleation on terraces instead of near step edges is proposed to be crucial for producing high&#8208;quality graphene on SiC(0001) surface.







Abstract
The transfer&#8208;free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si semiconductor technologies for directly fabricating high&#8208;end electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene nucleation on Si-terminated hexagonal-SiC(0001) surface is elucidated. The stable carbon clusters, preferential nucleation sites and nucleation pathways are revealed, and a nucleation diagram is established. Contradictory experimental observations on graphene growth on SiC(0001) surface are explained. Nucleation on terraces instead of near step edges is proposed to be crucial for producing high-quality graphene on SiC(0001) surface.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer-free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state-of-the-art Si semiconductor technologies for directly fabricating high-end electronics. Although significant progress has been achieved in epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC recently, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a theoretical study to elucidate graphene near-equilibrium nucleation on Si-terminated hexagonal-SiC(0001) surface. It is found that the ultra-large lattice mismatch between SiC(0001) surface and graphene and the highly localized electron distribution on SiC(0001) surface lead to a distinctive nucleation process: (i)&#8197;Most of the magic carbon clusters on SiC(0001) show only &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry and are mainly composed of pentagonal rings; (ii)&#8197;Two possible nucleation pathways are revealed, &lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., longitudinal and circular modes; (iii)&#8197;Carbon clusters are more stable on flat terraces than near atomic step edges. Based on above findings, a graphene nucleation diagram on SiC(0001) is established and experimentally observed contradictories for graphene growth on SiC(0001) are answered. Our in-depth understanding on graphene nucleation on SiC(0001) extends nucleation mechanisms of 2D crystals and will benefit high-quality graphene growth on SiC(0001).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Surface Reconstruction as the Primary Trigger for Capacity Loss in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical failures, such as cracks and nanopores,  along with the associated surface reconstruction, have long been regarded as the primary causes of capacity decay in ultra&#8208;high Ni layered oxides. However, the impact of these failures on performance degradation has not yet been effectively elucidate and distinguished. Herein, we develop ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo&#8208;mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer in Hybrid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Boosted Interface Stability and Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex interactions between the inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) and the liquid electrolyte (LE) give rise to challenges of achieving durable interface stability in hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (HQSE), and the influence on the involved ISE surface ionic conductivity also needs to be investigated. Here, 4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (CBSA) is utilized to establish a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12&#160;(LLZTO), which is then incorporated into PEGDA&#8208;based in&#8208;situ polymerized HQSE. The results show that the introduction of CBSA significantly improves the LLZTO/LE interface stability with the optimized solvation structure, resulting in a favorable ionic conductivity (1.19 mS cm&#8208;1) and an increasing Li+ transference number (0.647). Mechanisms for the promotion of ionic conduction and interfacial stability of SAM&#8208;HQSE are unveiled through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Raman spectra and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear&#8208;magnetic&#8208;resonance. There are no short&#8208;circuits in the Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells after 1000 h. The Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|LFP cells or Graphite|SAM&#8208;HQSE|LFP pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2% and 87.0% with the 0.5.C&#8208;rate for 500 and 300 cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro&#8208;environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li+ conduction in a hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte system.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Anomeric C(sp3)&#8722;H Cyclization Towards the Design of New Cyclophane&#8208;Braced Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H anomeric activation approach has been developed for the synthesis of cyclophane&#8208;braced glycopeptides. This technique is versatile and can be applied to glycopeptides of various cyclic sizes. In addition, biological evaluations of some glycophanes revealed that this series exhibits promising antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Here we report a macrocyclization route towards the synthesis of glycophane peptides by a selective C&#8722;H arylation of the anomeric bond. This approach demonstrates the power of Pd&#8208;catalysis C&#8722;H activation to access unusual cyclic peptides.

         <title>Freestanding Phosphonium Covalent Organic Frameworks with Efficient Hydroxide Conduction for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline&#8208;stable phosphonium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) work as durable and efficient hydroxide conductors for zinc&#8211;air battery applications. Especially, the COFs with a minimal ion exchange capacity of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 resulted in 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and batteries with the COF electrolytes demonstrated stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min.







Abstract
Owing to their well&#8208;defined crystalline pore structures and ordered functional ionic groups along the skeleton, ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) exhibit excellent performance and have significant potential for use in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we for the first time developed cationic phosphonium COFs with high hydroxide conduction even with low ion exchange capacity (IEC). Specifically, we synthesized COFs containing quaternary phosphonium groups as excellent ion transport moieties. Then, we fabricated freestanding phosphonium membranes through a vapor&#8208;assisted method, which exhibited high hydroxide conductivity of 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C from a minimal IEC of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The resulting film was successfully applied to zinc&#8211;air batteries, demonstrating energy density of 96.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 95.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min. Overall, in addition to investigating a novel cationic functional group, we demonstrated a freestanding film formation method of COF&#8208;based materials. The findings can provide a solid foundation for advancing the field of iCOFs to ion transport and promoting electrochemical applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitrile Derived Lithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.







Abstract
Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross&#8208;coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross&#8208;coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo&#8208;unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom&#8208;stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (N&#8208;stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds, previously challenging in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated &#945;-amino nitrile derived lithium reagents with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed. The rapid fluorine-editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross-coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross-coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo-unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;-fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom-stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel-catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated &#945;-amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross-coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R bonds, previously challenging in transition-metal-catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;-hydride elimination. The rapid fluorine-editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds Through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Opening/Isomerization of Densely Substituted Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted cyclopropanols and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific transformation into 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyls. The developed ring opening/chain walking sequence enables access to dialdehydes and ketoaldehydes bearing vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters as single diastereomers in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
We report a highly diastereoselective protocol for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds from densely substituted cyclopropanols. The methodology involves a palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening reaction followed by a &#8220;metal&#8208;walk&#8221; and oxidation of a remote hydroxyl group. The methodology represents a new application of cyclopropanols as initiation sites for chain walking remote functionalization. Importantly, this approach provides a straightforward access to highly valuable succinaldehyde derivatives bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters as single diastereomers.

         <title>Highly Efficient Chiral Separation Based on Alkali&#8208;proof Protein Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based chiral stationary phases that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. Upon incorporating CSPs into chiral separation columns, we enable high&#8208;precision chiral chromatographic separation with exceptional stability.







Abstract
Chiral separation plays a pivotal role in both practical applications and industrial productions. However, traditional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) exhibit inherent instability in alkaline environments, presenting a significant challenge despite their importance. Herein, basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based CSPs that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. An in&#8208;depth theoretical simulation is conducted to unveil the unique three&#8208;dimensional conformation of alcalase, showing selective affinity towards various enantiomers of chiral amino acids and drugs, especially acidic substrates. Subsequently, an in situ assembly strategy is used to immobilize alcalase within a hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platform. The generated protein&#8208;based CSPs enable successful baseline separation (Rs&#8805;1.50) for various value&#8208;added compounds (e.g., non&#8208;steroidal drug, RS&#8208;flurbiprofen; nucleotide analog, RS&#8208;tenofovir) via high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, surpassing the commercial chiral column. Furthermore, a systematic study reveals that increasing hydrophilicity and pore sizes of COFs can enhance the separation performance. Remarkably, the obtained CSPs demonstrated exceptional durability, maintaining performance for &gt;2,400 runs. This study provides a new member to the protein library for CSPs, and represents an innovative and effective platform for CSPs with immense potential for the enantioseparation of acidic drugs.

         <title>Printing Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy for Microvasculature using Degradable DNA Biolubricant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature. Utilizing the DNA hydrogel as biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature and cell&#8208;laden tissue constructs with branched microvasculatures.







Abstract
Microvasculature is essential for the continued function of cells in tissue and is fundamental in the fields of tissue engineering, organ repair and drug screening. However, the fabrication of microvasculature is still challenging using existing strategies. Here, we developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature, which eliminates the need for a subsequent cell seeding process and the associated deficiencies. Utilizing the shear&#8208;thinning property of DNA hydrogels as a novel sacrificial, cell&#8208;laden biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature, breaking the limit of 100&#8197;&#956;m. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest endothelialized microvasculature that has ever been bioprinted so far. In addition, the self&#8208;healing property of DNA hydrogels allows the creation of continuous branched structures. This strategy provides a new platform for constructing complex hierarchical vascular networks and offers new opportunity towards engineering thick tissues. The extremely low volume of sacrificial biolubricant paves the way for DNA hydrogels to be used in practical tissue engineering applications. The high&#8208;resolution bioprinting technique also exhibits great potential for printing lymphatics, retinas and neural networks in the future.

         <title>Precise Photochemical Post&#8208;Processing of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a method to fabricate molecular crystals of desired size and aspect ratio that capitalizes on their photochemical reactivity. The resulting crystals retain their physical properties and can be used to transduce light, among other applications requiring aspect ratios that are currently unavailable by crystallization approaches.







Abstract
Molecular crystals carry a great potential as new soft smart materials, with a plethora of recent examples overcoming the major obstacle of mechanical flexibility, and this research direction holds enormous potential to revolutionize optics, electronics, medicine, and space exploration. However, shaping organic crystals into desired shapes and sizes remains a major practical challenge due to the lack of control over the crystallization process, and the difficulties in mechanical post&#8208;processing without introduction of defects that are usually imparted by their soft nature. Here we present an innovative approach that employs photochemical processing for precise and nondestructive cutting of a molecular crystal. Our proposed method uses light to post&#8208;process crystals of the desired size and shape, similar to using light to cut other materials. This reaction induces strain, ensuring sharp cleavage without the need for melting or other processes. We further demonstrate the potential of this approach by producing crystals of arbitrary size, which can be used as controllable optical waveguides. Among other potential applications, this method can be used to prepare dynamic crystals, particularly those with aspect ratios crucial for mechanical deformation, such as flexible electronics, soft robotics, and sensing.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Twisted Conformational Changes in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Host&#8208;Guest Systems: Theoretical Modeling and Chiroptical Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model were applied to analyze 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for achiral and chiral host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208;twisted conformations (HM and HP) and chiral and achiral guest molecules (GX). Theoretical analysis for the variable temperature circular dichroism (VT&#8722;CD) experiments resulted in the successful determination of the thermodynamic parameters, equilibrium constants (K), and molar CD values.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance chiral materials is to design and synthesize host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208; (M&#8208; and P&#8208;)twisted conformations and to control their twisted conformations. For this, a quantitative analysis is required to describe the chiroptical inversion, chiral transfer, and chiral recognition in the host&#8208;guest systems, which is generally performed using circular dichroism (CD) and/or proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8197;NMR) spectroscopies. However, the mass&#8208;balance model that considers the M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations has not yet been established. In this study, we derived the novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems. Then, we further applied them to analyze the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for the achiral calixarene&#8208;based capsule molecule, achiral dimeric zinc porphyrin tweezer molecule, and chiral pillar[5]arene with the chiral and/or achiral guest molecules by using the data obtained from the CD titration, variable temperature CD (VT&#8722;CD), and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments.

     alt="Temperature-Dependent Left- and Right-Twisted Conformational Changes in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 Host-Guest Systems: Theoretical Modeling and Chiroptical Simulations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel equations based on the mass-balance model were applied to analyze 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest systems for achiral and chiral host molecules with left- and right-twisted conformations (H&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) and chiral and achiral guest molecules (G&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;). Theoretical analysis for the variable temperature circular dichroism (VT&#8722;CD) experiments resulted in the successful determination of the thermodynamic parameters, equilibrium constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;), and molar CD values.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient strategy for high-performance chiral materials is to design and synthesize host molecules with left- and right- (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-)twisted conformations and to control their twisted conformations. For this, a quantitative analysis is required to describe the chiroptical inversion, chiral transfer, and chiral recognition in the host-guest systems, which is generally performed using circular dichroism (CD) and/or proton nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR) spectroscopies. However, the mass-balance model that considers the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-twisted conformations has not yet been established. In this study, we derived the novel equations based on the mass-balance model for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest systems. Then, we further applied them to analyze the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest systems for the achiral calixarene-based capsule molecule, achiral dimeric zinc porphyrin tweezer molecule, and chiral pillar[5]arene with the chiral and/or achiral guest molecules by using the data obtained from the CD titration, variable temperature CD (VT&#8722;CD), and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR experiments. The thermodynamic parameters (&#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;), equilibrium constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;), and molar CD (&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;) in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest systems could be successfully determined by the theoretical analyses using the derived equations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imidazolate&#8208;Stabilized Cu(III): Dioxygen to Oxides at Type 3 Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Type 3 (coupled binuclear) copper systems reduce dioxygen for transport, substrate oxygenation, and electron transfer across aerobic life. Using synthetic models with protic histidine environments, we find that the histidine&#8208;stabilized copper centers become not just one&#8208;electron but also two&#8208;electron shuttles&#8212;they isomerize to copper(III) when deprotonated by a base.







Abstract
Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to an oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes ligated exclusively by monodentate imidazoles, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate&#8208;ligated bis(&#956;2&#8208;oxido)dicopper(III) species. Formal two&#8208;electron oxidation to Cu(III) remains biologically unprecedented, yet is effected readily by addition of base. Spectrophotometric titrations by UV/Visible/near&#8208;IR and copper K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies are interpreted most simply as two cooperative, 2H+ transformations in which the peroxide O&#8722;O is cleaved in the first step. Elaboration from simple imidazoles to a protected histidine extends this isomerization into an amino acid environment. The role of phenolate as a base suggests this four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 is energetically viable in a biological context and requires only two copper centers, which act as two&#8208;electron shuttles when imidazole deprotonation assists. This existential precedent of viable imidazolate intermediates invites speculation into an alternative mechanism for phenol hydroxylation not previously considered at Type 3 copper sites such as tyrosinases. Structural biological evidence suggests imidazolate ligation of copper may be more widespread than generally understood.

         <title>Electron Delocalized Ni Active Sites in Spinel Catalysts Enable Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel&#8208;based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH&#8208; binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus&#8208;substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity to over 26.8% with a peak current density of 300 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, while partial phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1% for liquid products (NOx&#8208;). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote&#8208;site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby&#8208;site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Intratumoral Transforming Boron Nanosensitizers for Amplified Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an advanced binary tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selected heavy&#8208;particle radiotherapy used for treating invasive malignant tumors. However, its clinical applications have been impeded by the rapid metabolism and insufficient tumor&#8208;specific accumulation of boron agents. To tackle this issue, we develop a smart boron nanosensitizer (BATBN) capable of transforming its size in response to cancer biomarker for optimal balance between penetration and retention of boron&#8208;10 for BNCT. BATBN comprises an ultrasmall boron quantum dots (BQD) core (4 nm) conjugated with cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, which facilitates its cellular uptake and deep tumor penetration. In the tumor microenvironment, the tumor biomarker can specifically initiate a self&#8208;condensation reaction of BATBN, leading to the formation of larger&#8208;sized nanoaggregates. Due to such a specific intratumoral transformation, BATBN demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in intratumoral boron concentration and a 5.0&#8208;fold increase in tumor retention time compared to the BQDs. Thus, the relative tumor volume of the BATBN&#8208;treatment group is 2.7&#8208;fold smaller than that of BQDs in preclinical tumor models after 21 days of neutron irradiation treatment. This study presents a supramolecular strategy to endow BNCT agents with the biomarker&#8208;activated size interconversion, permitting precise and efficient BNCT for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar,&#8208;CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Interpenetration&#8208;Free Mesoporous Aromatic Frameworks by Manipulating Catalysts as Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry allows the design and synthesis of mesoporous networks by extending the size of the building blocks. However, interpenetration of the nets easily happens against the designed mesoporous networks, thereby falling short of achieving the intended specific surface area and pore size. Controlling the framework interpenetration has always been a challenge in the synthesis section of reticular chemistry. In this work, based on our previously reported type of highly porous aromatic frameworks (named PAF&#8208;1), we extended the tetrahedral building blocks to target an iso&#8208;reticular mesoporous PAF&#8208;333. A series of Ni(0) ligands with different sizes were employed to confirm that suitable&#8208;sized catalyst ligands could successfully inhibit skeleton interpenetration in the coupling reaction through the steric hindrance effect. The obtained mesoporous PAF&#8208;333 possessed a pore size of approximately 3.2 nm matching well with the value from the predicted non&#8208;interpenetrated structure. PAF&#8208;333 showed great high&#8208;pressure hydrogen and methane storage potential with a 13.4 wt% H2 uptake at 77 K, 100 bar and a 0.537 g g&#8208;1 CH4 uptake at 298 K, 98 bar, ranking at the top of the reported porous adsorbents in the gas storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence with Bis&#8208;pyclen Yb(III) Chelates: Crown vs. Linear Polyether Linkers in Discrete Heteropolynuclear Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands combining 2 lateral bis&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclens were synthesized, using a linear pegylated linker L2 or a K22 crown&#8208;ether L3. A functionalized pyridyl&#8208;phosphonated&#8208;pyclen L1 was also prepared as a mononuclear analogue. Coordination behavior of lanthanide cations was studied via NMR titration with Lu for L1, UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence spectroscopy with Yb for L2/L3. Strong coordination of two Yb atoms enabled isolation and spectroscopic characterization of dinuclear complexes in H2O and D2O. Excited state lifetime at 980nm revealed strong protection of Yb cations, with no coordinated water. Upon titration of the isolated dinuclear Yb complexes with Tb cations cooperative upconversion (UC) sensitization of Tb in the visible was observed (excitation of Yb, 980nm, D2O). In absence of Tb, the Yb complexes also exhibited cooperative luminescence with a weak emission band around 500nm upon NIR Yb excitation. UC with Tb was only observed after thermal treatment, suggesting a slow kinetic of formation of the UC species. [Yb2TbL3] showed weak Tb centered UC emission, while the dinuclear complex of L2 displayed more intense UC emission up to two equivalents of Tb, forming [(Yb2L2)Tbx] (x=1&#8208;2), with the tetranuclear heterometallic complex being the most intense emitter. Log&#8208;Log plot analysis confirmed the 2&#8208;photon nature of the UC process.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric carbon nitride edged with spatially isolated Donor and Acceptor for Sunlight&#8208;driven H2O2 Synthesis and In&#8208;situ Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;site H2O2 activation attracts much attention in energy conversion and environment remediation et al, yet remains challenging in its highly efficient and sustainable synthesis. Herein, we grafted a pair of spatially isolated donor (methoxyphenyl unit) and acceptor (anthraquinone unit) in polymeric carbon nitride edges, which induce directional electron&#8208;hole transfer to the two spatially separated dual active centers. Specifically, photogenerated electrons in the anthraquinone unit facilitate the 2e&#8208; ORR, while the methoxyphenyl unit, which gathers photogenerated holes, enables rapid 4e&#8208; WOR. More impressively, the anthraquinone unit also exhibits strong proton extraction capabilities to boost the generation of *OOH intermediates and H2O2. Consequently, the reported donor&#8208;plyometric carbon nitrite&#8208;acceptor (DPA) polymer shows a remarkable H2O2 yield of 6497.1 &#956;M h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 in pure water, surpassing traditional DP and PA catalysts. Because of its high efficiency, the H2O2 product can efficiently degrade and mineralize various organic contaminants in a continuous&#8208;flow self&#8208;Fenton reactor under sunlight irradiation. Our work presents an unprecedented approach to designing photocatalysts with efficient H2O2 synthesis and practical application from a molecular engineering perspective.</dc:description>

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetric Protonation Driven Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis in Supramolecular Photocatalysts via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air.&#160;The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4667 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60 min.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Electric Fields on Oxidization Processes at the Air&#8208;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the air&#8208;water interface, many reactions are accelerated, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This phenomenon has proved to be particularly important in water microdroplets, where the spontaneous oxidation of many species stable in bulk has been experimentally demonstrated. Different theories have been proposed to explain this finding, but it is currently believed that the role of interfacial electric fields is key. In this work, we have carried out a quantum chemistry study aimed at shedding some light on this question. We have studied two prototypical processes in which a hydroxide anion transfers its excess electron to either the water environment or a dioxygen molecule. To model the interface, we use a cluster of 21 water molecules immersed in an electric field, and we examine the energetics of the studied reactions as a function of field magnitude. Our results reveal that electric fields close to those estimated for the neat air&#8208;water interface (~0.15 V&#215;&#197;&#8208;1) have a moderate effect on the reaction energetics and that much stronger fields (&gt;1 V&#215;&#197;&#8208;1) are required to get spontaneous electron transfer. Therefore, the study suggests that additional factors such as an excess charge in microdroplets need to be considered for explaining the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Carboxylation of Benzylic Tertiary C&#8208;H Bonds with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct catalytic carboxylation of benzylic tertiary C&#8208;H bonds with CO2 for the synthesis of all&#8208;carbon quaternary carboxylic acids represents a significant challenge. Here, we present a redox&#8208;neutral approach to address this difficulty by leveraging the synergistic interplay between photocatalysis and cascade hydrogen abstraction cycles. Remarkably, this strategy eliminates the need for sacrificial electron donors, electron acceptors, or stoichiometric additives, offering enhanced atom economy and environmental sustainability. It is particular that the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals with sulfur radicals generated in situ from the decomposition of DMSO was employed to realize the abstraction of benzylic tertiary C&#8208;H bonds. Our method enables the direct synthesis of a diverse array of benzylic quaternary carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance as well as the derivatization of bioactive molecules and the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt; 70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420 nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10 mol%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Kalmanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kalmanol (1) is the first isolated kalmane&#8208;type grayanoid featuring a highly oxidized 5/8/5/5 tetracyclic carbon skeleton and 9 contiguous stereocenters. We have accomplished the efficient and asymmetric total synthesis of 1 in 16 steps from known compounds (20 steps from commercially available starting materials) by a modular synthetic strategy. A tetracyclic intermediate was prepared in a convergent manner through a Grignard reaction and a subsequent ring&#8208;closing metathesis reaction of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The polyhydroxyl groups were introduced by late&#8208;stage stereo&#8208; and regioselective oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Aggregate Electrochemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecule in solutions is the energy storage unit in the organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs), of which the aggregation is acknowledged pivotal but has been rarely investigated. By establishing a pyridinium library, the manipulation over the aggregation in solutions is investigated at the molecular level. Both theoretical calculations and physiochemical methods are used to characterize the aggregate&#8217;s structure, and salient findings are as follows. First, the singly&#8208;reduced monoradicals simultaneously aggregate in a concentrated solution, which is driven by the solvation effect, orbital overlap and dispersion interaction. Second, the aggregation can be manipulated by the molecular engineering strategy and counteracted by introducing either electrostatic repulsive force or twisted geometry. Third, the monoradical&#8217;s aggregation yields a decrease in the molecular singly occupied molecular orbital energy level and a linear scaling relationship with its thermodynamic potential. As a result, the increase in the concentration lowers the battery&#8217;s voltage, which counteracts its effort to increase the battery&#8217;s energy density. The anti&#8208;aggregation is proven effective in breaking the scaling relationship and accordingly, a molecular strategy to manipulate aggregate electrochemistry is developed. This work provides physical insights into the electrolytic solution and chemical strategy for optimizing the flow battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Featuring Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformation as An Efficient Electrolyte Additive for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is promising but still challenging for the widespread application of aqueous zinc batteries due to the poor reversibility of the Zn anode caused by prevalent dendrite growth and pronounced interfacial s  ide reactions. Herein, we report  a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable high&#8208;nuclearity {Nd9Si4W39} polyoxotungstate. Interestingly, upon encountering Zn2+ ions, the discrete {Nd9Si4W39} nanocluster undergoes a structural transformation to form an infinitely extended cluster&#8208;based {[Zn(H2O)4]3[Nd9Si4W39]2} two&#8208;dimensional honeycomb layer, with which atomic&#8208;level Zn2+ ion effects in reconstructing the layer are determined. More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd9Si4W39} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd9Si4W39} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000 hours at a current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long&#8208;term service life.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiosulfate&#8208;Mediated Polysulfide Redox for Energetic Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;). The S2O32&#8722; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short&#8208;chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;) within the K2S2O3&#160;electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E0 &gt; 0 V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470 mAh gs&#8722;1, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616 Wh kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8722;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate&#8208;mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the Cyclopiane Family of Diterpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;stage chemoenzymatic synthesis of the cyclopiane family and related diterpenes is reported. Deoxyconidiogenol with a 6/5/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic cyclopiane skeleton was first produced by an engineered E. coli host harboring the corresponding terpene cyclase PchDS. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were synthesized by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D of the cyclopiane skeleton through direct redox operations, directed C&#8208;H activation, and enzymatic hydroxylation, respectively. Skeletal diversification was achieved by taking advantage of the selective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration of a cyclopiane cation generated chemically or enzymatically. Three cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons, including the spiro 5/5/5/5&#8208;tetracyclic skeleton of spiroviolene, the angular 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused ring system of phomopsene, and the new linear 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic ring system of amycolatene, were produced either by chemical skeletal transformation from the cyclopiane skeleton, or by terpene cyclases discovered by genome mining.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for&#160;Boosting&#160;H2O2 Photosynthesis via the Synergy of Multiple Charge Transfer Channels and Polarized Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, while attaining high&#8208;performance COFs remains a formidable challenge due to the insufficient separation of photogenerated charges. Here, through the rational design of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (Cz&#8208;COFs), we showcase the first achievement in piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 using COFs. Noteworthily, the ethenyl group&#8208;modified Cz&#8208;COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) demonstrates&#160;a record&#8208;high yield of H2O2 (9212 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) from air and pure water through piezo&#8208;photocatalysis, which is ca. 2.5 times higher than that of pristine Cz&#8208;COFs without ethenyl groups (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;H) under identical condition and COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth without ultrasonic treatment. The H2O2 production rate originates from the synergistic effect between an ultrasonication&#8208;induced polarized electric field and the spatially separated multiple charge transfer channels, which significantly promote the utilization of photogenerated electrons by directional transfer from bicarbazole groups to the ethenyl group&#8208;modified benzene rings. Several Cz&#8208;COFs and bifluorenylidene&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;BFTB&#8208;H) with similar twisted monomers exhibit obvious piezoelectric performance for promoting H2O2 generation, signifying that organic ligands with a twistable structure play a crucial role in creating broken symmetry structures, thereby establishing piezoelectric properties in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalytic Reactions Networks: A Pathway to Spatial Temporal Mastery in Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autocatalytic reactions present a significant opportunity for the precise spatial and temporal control of dynamic materials, mimicking the characteristics of living matter within autonomous chemical systems. Herein, we have crafted an autocatalytic chemical reaction network (CRN) designed to be incorporated into a dynamic system, allowing for efficient control of both sol(I)&#8208;gel and gel&#8208;sol(II) transitions through autocatalytic fronts. The CRN incorporates two autocatalytic reactions. The first reaction promotes the formation of disulfide crosslinks while increasing the local pH through base product generation, catalyzing further disulfide bond formation and initiating a polymerization front that transforms the liquid phase into a gel. A subsequent, slower reaction triggered at the gel/air interface, resulted in the reduction of disulfide crosslinks, transforming the gel back into a liquid state through accelerating fronts. The dynamics of these autocatalytic fronts are accurately predicted by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, providing a theoretical framework for system preprogramming. Moreover, our results show that the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition can be reliably repeated multiple times. This approach not only enhances our understanding of autocatalytic CRNs but also pioneers a new approach for developing dynamic materials with life&#8208;like properties, significantly impacting material science and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Batrachopolyenes: Volatile Norsteroids from Femoral Scent Glands of Frogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroid hormones are C18&#8208;C21&#8208;sterane derivatives, featuring the typical 6&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5 ring system. Here we report on a novel C18&#8208;steroid ring system named batrachane with a contracted A&#8208;ring resulting in a 5&#8208;6&#8208;6&#8208;5 ring arrangement. The isolation, structural elucidation, and total synthesis of three members of the novel batrachopolyene family occurring in the tropical frog genus Odontobatrachus is reported. The batrachopolyenes represent an entirely new collection of volatile steroidal natural products produced by anuran amphibians. Alongside the contracted A&#8208;ring, each member contains a &#916;16&#8208;17 double bond but differs in the central belt of the steroidal structure. To create these atypical structural features, syntheses featuring a combination of Breslow radical chain relay chlorination, Favorskii ring contraction, and Clemmensen reduction proved successful. The occurrence of such compounds in another distal anuran group, the Mantellinae, suggests a more widespread distribution of the batrachane&#8208;type compounds among frogs. The new structural steroid type raises questions concerning steroid biosynthesis and reception, as well as distribution in frogs in general and the structures of their hormones.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Activity&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Amylase Probes for Dissection and Annotation of Linear and Branched&#8208;Chain Starch&#8208;Degrading Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Amylases are the workhorse enzymes of starch degradation. They are central to human health, including as targets for anti&#8208;diabetic compounds, but are also the key enzymes in the industrial processing of starch for biofuels, corn syrups, brewing and detergents. Dissection of the activity, specificity and stability of &#945;&#8208;amylases is crucial to understanding their biology and allowing their exploitation. Yet, functional characterization lags behind DNA sequencing and genomics; and new tools are required for rapid analysis of &#945;&#8208;amylase function. Here, we design, synthesize and apply new branched &#945;&#8208;amylase activity&#8208;based probes. Using both &#945;&#8208;1,6 branched and unbranched &#945;&#8208;1,4 maltobiose activity&#8208;based probes we were able to explore the stability and substrate specificity of both a panel of human gut microbial &#945;&#8208;amylases and a panel of industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;amylases. We also demonstrate how we can detect and annotate the substrate specificity of &#945;&#8208;amylases in the complex cell lysate of both a prominent gut microbe and a diverse compost sample by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and mass spectrometry. A toolbox of starch&#8208;active activity&#8208;based probes will enable rapid functional dissection of &#945;&#8208;amylases. We envisage activity&#8208;based probes contributing to better selection and engineering of enzymes for industrial application as well as fundamental analysis of enzymes in human health.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for embedding catalytically active polyoxovanadate (POV) into supramolecular assemblies was developed by utilizing host&#8208;guest interactions between pillararenes grafted on the cluster and ditopic linkers. The amphiphilic nature of the POV in the host&#8208;guest complex promoted responsive behavior of the assembly toward the solvent polarity. Lastly, the assembly showed enhanced catalytic properties compared to the parent POV.







Abstract
Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material for a given task. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as particularly interesting candidates to be used in supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in the fields of energy conversion/storage or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in the field of supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a POMcovalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8211;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8211;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>

The first microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which are functionalized by open pyrene sites, thereby exhibits exceptional Xe/Kr separation performance surpassing all previously reported HOF materials under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31&#8197;cm3/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) of 184&#8197;mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universally applicable supramolecular strategy to transition room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from solid states to aqueous phases is reported. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, a series of aqueous RTP materials are constructed through the noncovalent dispersion of diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain.







Abstract
Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8211;790&#8197;nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450&#8197;nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8211;30.7&#8201;%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins Using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;UV readout (SBS) in microbial rhodopsins can be used to probe the retinal configuration as well as electrostatic changes associated with the charge translocation during the ion pumping process in real time.







Abstract
Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity. Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8722;&#8208;(NmHR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and&#8212;being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal&#8212;even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.

         <dc:description>
Cognitive diversity explores aspects beyond traditional lenses of culture, physical diversity, and merit and into variations in problem solving skills. Understanding aspects that need to be recognized in recruitment for various scientific enterprises will promote higher productivity, efficiency, diversity and heterogeneity in a team.







Abstract
Cognitively diverse teams outperform high intelligence (IQ) teams in problem solving, while businesses with at least one woman in their board of directors financially outperform ones with all men boards. These well&#8208;known facts are lost in most academic science enterprises. Herein, we make the case for looking at sources, approaches, and opportunities in expanding cognitive diversity of research teams for high productivity and efficiency.

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach is used to grow naphthalenediimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor MOF thin films for efficient free charge generation in response to light. Interestingly, we find that the optimum photocurrent response is obtained at a low optimal doping concentration of acceptor, which outperforms traditional donor&#8208;MOF thin films by a factor of forty.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3&#8201;%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Coupling Rotary Motion to Helicene Inversion within a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;powered molecular motor featuring a specifically engineered helicene moiety is presented. The inversion of the helicene fragment is mechanically coupled to the unidirectional rotation of the motor in a 6&#8208;step rotation cycle, which involves 8 isomers. This coupled motion results in the dynamic modulation of the handedness of the helicene by the motor via a central to helical to helical chiral transmission mechanism.







Abstract
Towards complex coupled molecular motions, the remote handedness inversion of a helicene moiety was achieved by a rotary molecular motor. The use of a specifically engineered dynamic helicene stator in a novel overcrowded&#8208;alkene second&#8208;generation molecular motor based on a fluorinated dibenzofluorene fragment allows for an unprecedented control over helicity inversion. This is achieved by the mechanical coupling of the rotation of the rotor to the helicene inversion of the stator half via a remote chirality transmission process. Thus, the unidirectional rotary motion generated upon irradiation is used to invert the dynamic stereochemistry of a helicene, leading to a 6&#8208;step cycle with eight intermediates. In this cycle, both alternation between P and M configurations of the helicene stator and dynamic thermal interconversion (paddling motion) can be achieved. In&#8208;depth computational and spectroscopic studies were performed to support the associated mechanism. The control over coupled motion and dynamic helicity offers prospects for the development of complex responsive systems.

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2 and O2: Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a kinetic multilayer model and comprehensive experimental data, this study investigates the oxidation of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions, going beyond traditional shrinking core modelling approaches. The study develops a molecular picture of the reaction system, including a reference chemical reaction mechanisms and energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways.







Abstract
Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from

130&#8197;kJ/mol. We derive energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways that involve uni&#8208; or bimolecular decomposition of reactive oxygen intermediates.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism of photon&#8208;upconversion using a spin&#8208;flip process was proposed and demonstrated by combining a triplet sensitizer and a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecule. The triplet energy transfer from the green phosphorescent emitter (Ir(ppy)3) to the blue TADF emitter (CzBSe) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.

         <title>Exploiting High Order Magnetic Anisotropy for Advanced Magnetocaloric Refrigerants</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal experiments on the novel 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complex [DyDOTA][CrF2(py)4] (DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate, py=pyridine) have revealed a tetragonal easy&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Temperature and magnetic&#8208;field dependent experiments to evaluate the rotating magnetocaloric effect demonstrated the potential of high&#8208;order anisotropies for developing more efficient magnetocaloric materials.







Abstract
Three new 3&#8201;d&#8211;4&#8201;f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M=Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln=Dy3+ or Y3+, py=pyridine and DOTA=tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride&#8208;bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four&#8208;fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy3+ complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and ab initio calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all about oxygen! Photochemical upcycling of polystyrene occurs efficiently using an acridinium photocatalyst even under solar irradiation. However, contrary to expectations, the mechanism proceeds through the generation of reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is a commodity plastic recalcitrant to chemical recycling or upcycling processes. Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the robust C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds of PS. We show that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS substrates into up to 40&#8201;% benzoic acid (BAc), formic acid (FA) and small proportions of acetophenone (ACP), under visible light (456&#8197;nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77&#8201;% of the photons absorbed vs. 1&#8201;% for the direct reaction with PS (0.303&#8197;M in repeating units). These results are in agreement with a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photo upcycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion even in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis of the irradiated samples.

         <title>Stable Mono&#8208;Radical and Triplet Diradicals Based on Allylic Radical&#8208;Embedded All&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The derivative of an allylic radical&#8208;embedded all&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbon (dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene) was synthesized, which showed high stability due to captodative effect and desired high&#8208;spin triplet ground state with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic radicals are notable for their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but synthesizing stable high&#8208;spin systems is challenging due to their inherent reactivity. This study presents a novel strategy for designing stable high&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) by incorporating allylic radical into fused aromatic benzenoid rings. To enhance stability, large steric hindrance groups with a synergistic captodative effect were added to the allylic radical centers. This approach was applied to synthesize derivatives of two open&#8208;shell all&#8208;benzenoid PHs: benzo[fg]tetracene (1) and dibenzo[fg,lm]heptacene (2). Both compounds exhibited excellent stability, with diradical 2 showing a half&#8208;life of up to 17.2&#8197;days under ambient conditions. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that 1 and 2 predominantly feature Clar's aromatic sextet structures with embedded allylic radicals. Compound 2 was confirmed to have a triplet ground state through DFT calculations and experimental methods, including pulse EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. This work introduces a new design strategy for stable high&#8208;spin hydrocarbons, paving the way for future developments in high&#8208;spin organic materials.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Aziridines: Enhancing Polysulfides for Superior Mechanical Strength and Adhesive Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triaziridine crosslinker, SaC&#8208;100, is used in inverse vulcanization to create polysulfides with superior mechanical strength. These polymers exhibit exceptional adhesion to various substrates and maintain their performance at extremely low temperatures.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel approach to inverse vulcanization by utilizing a commercially available triaziridine crosslinker as an alternative to conventional olefin&#8208;based crosslinkers. The model reactions reveal a self&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of &#8220;unactivated&#8221; aziridine with elemental sulfur, forming oligosulfide&#8208;functionalized diamines. The triaziridine&#8208;derived polysulfides exhibit impressive mechanical properties, achieving a maximum stress of ~8.3&#8197;MPa and an elongation at break of ~107&#8201;%. The incorporation of silicon dioxide (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%) enhances the composite's rigidity, yielding a Young's modulus of ~0.94&#8197;GPa. Furthermore, these polysulfides display excellent adhesion strength on various substrates, such as aluminum (~7.0&#8197;MPa), walnut (~9.6&#8197;MPa), and steel (~11.0&#8197;MPa), with substantial retention of adhesion strength (~3.3&#8197;MPa on steel) at &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C. The straightforward synthetic process, combined with the accessibility of the triaziridine crosslinker, emphasizes the potential for further innovations in sulfur polymer chemistry.

         <title>Selective Nonenzymatic Formation of Biologically Common RNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template&#8208;free RNA loop&#8208;closing ligation selectively generates RNA tetraloops that are prevalent in biology, as demonstrated by high&#8208;throughput sequencing. Utilizing high&#8208;yield overhang sequences enables the efficient assembly of functional RNAs.







Abstract
The prebiotic formation of RNA building blocks is well&#8208;supported experimentally, yet the emergence of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;specific RNA oligomers is generally attributed to biological selection via Darwinian evolution rather than prebiotic chemical selectivity. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate the partitioning of randomized RNA overhangs into ligated products by either splinted ligation or loop&#8208;closing ligation. Comprehensive sequence&#8208;reactivity profiles revealed that loop&#8208;closing ligation preferentially yields hairpin structures with loop sequences UNNG, CNNG, and GNNA (where N represents A, C, G, or U) under competing conditions. In contrast, splinted ligation products tended to be GC rich. Notably, the overhang sequences that preferentially partition to loop&#8208;closing ligation significantly overlap with the most common biological tetraloops, whereas the overhangs favoring splinted ligation exhibit an inverse correlation with biological tetraloops. Applying these sequence rules enables the high&#8208;efficiency assembly of functional ribozymes from short RNAs without template inhibition. Our findings suggest that the RNA tetraloop structures that are common in biology may have been predisposed and prevalent in the prebiotic pool of RNAs, prior to the advent of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that the one&#8208;step prebiotic chemical process of loop&#8208;closing ligation could have favored the emergence of the first RNA functions.

         <title>Arene Ring Expansion by Ruthenium &#951;6&#8208;Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a new reactivity mode for &#960;&#8208;arene metal complexes to promote carbon group insertion is reported. The reaction uses ruthenium &#951;6&#8208;arene complexes supported by a tripodal ligand with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes in a single&#8208;step dearomatization process.







Abstract
Transition metal &#960;&#8208;arene complexes enable the dearomatization of benzene rings to access diversified unsaturated carbocycles through multistep synthetic procedures involving sequential addition of nucleophiles and electrophiles. This work details a single&#8208;step dearomatization process by reaction of Ru(&#951;6&#8208;arene) complexes with enolates derived from &#945;&#8208;halo or &#945;&#8208;(tosyloxy)esters to directly transform &#960;&#8208;coordinated arenes to ring&#8208;expanded cycloheptatrienes.

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the impact of coordination&#8208;induced spin&#8208;state switching on hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nickel(II) porphyrin, revealing that low&#8208;spin Ni(II) porphyrin favors hydrogen evolution while high&#8208;spin counterpart facilitates &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin periphery. Our finding highlights the pivotal role of spin transition in regulating the reactivity and selectivity of metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni (II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Configuration Assignment of (+)&#8208;Myxoquaterine&#8208;450</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise, modular synthesis of the structurally novel natural product myxoquaterine&#8208;450 (1) has been accomplished. Four building blocks were assembled by cross&#8208;coupling reactions to establish the all&#8208;(E)&#8208;configured hexaene core. The C25,C26&#8208;diastereoisomer of 1 was prepared to clarify the absolute configuration of the yet unassigned stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Myxoquaterines represent a recently discovered class of natural products with intriguing biological properties. They were isolated from Pendulasporacea albinea MSr 11954 and display a unique structure combining heterocyclic (pyrrole, oxazoline), hexaene, and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol subunits. We have now synthesized the first example of a myxoquaterine natural product, myxoquaterine&#8208;450, in a highly convergent fashion, in which the sensitive hexaene unit was established in the final stages of the synthesis (16 linear steps starting from l&#8208;serine). Comparison of the synthetic material with an authentic sample allowed to establish and confirm the constitution and configuration of the natural product.

         <title>Combination of Ambient and High&#8208;Temperature Beryllium Nitride Motifs in W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two first transition metal nitridoberyllates W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9 were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach starting from Be3N2, W and NH4N3 or NaN3, respectively. The layered crystal structures, which unite ambient and high&#8208;temperature motifs of beryllium nitride, was elucidated in a combined approach of several analytic techniques. The structure elucidation from X&#8208;ray diffraction data alone was not unambiguous.







Abstract
Compounds of transition metals and beryllium have a wide range of applications, from everyday tools to high tech applications. Remarkably, no single ternary beryllium nitride with a transition metal is known. Here, we report on the synthesis and properties of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates, namely W2Be4N5 and W4Be8N9. Both compounds were synthesized in a high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;pressure approach from Be3N2 and W, using azide generated N2 as an oxidizing agent. The crystal structures, consisting of alternating layers of WN6 trigonal prisms and BeN4 tetrahedra, were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). The separating nitridoberyllate layers show either ambient temperature (&#945;&#8208;Be3N2 type) or high temperature (&#946;&#8208;Be3N2 type) motifs. W2Be4N5 was further corroborated by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements. The latter revealed a mixed valence with an intermediate oxidation state of 3.5 for the W atoms. Both, the synthesis of the first transition metal nitridoberyllates and the synthesis approach using elemental W pave the way to a new field of nitride chemistry.

         <title>Adamantane&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate Phosphors AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ via Medium&#8208;Pressure Ion&#8208;Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method for the synthesis of nitridophosphate&#8208;based phosphors using hot isostatic pressing is presented. Ion exchange reactions starting from the Li&#8208;ion conductor Li10P4N10 enables the preparation of single crystals and bulk samples of compounds with the general formula AExLi10&#8722;2xP4N10. Upon doping with Eu2+, these compounds exhibit remarkable luminescent properties across the green to red spectral range.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium&#8208;pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8722;2xP4N10 (x=2, 2.7, 4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate&#8208;based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10. The synthesis route allowed for the preservation of the anionic [P4N10]10&#8722; structural motif of the starting material, while simultaneously introducing potential doping sites for Eu2+ by incorporating divalent alkaline earth cations (Ca2+/Sr2+). Upon excitation of Eu2+ doped samples with blue light, strong luminescence due to parity&#8208;allowed 4f6(7F)5d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition can be observed in the red (Ca2Li6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=626&#8197;nm), yellow/orange (Ca2.7Li4.6P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max1=506&#8197;nm, &#955;max2=592&#8197;nm and Sr3Li4P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=596&#8197;nm) and green (Ca4Li2P4N10&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+: &#955;max=546&#8197;nm) spectral regions of the visible light. The compounds presented, together with the simplified synthetic approach, demonstrate the significant potential of ion exchange on Li ion conductors for the development of novel nitridophosphates in the future.

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the perchlorate activation process in microbes, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex was developed in this work to facilitate the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate through the cooperation of bimetallic centers. With the aid of photoirradiation, the oxidative potential of perchlorate could be released in a controllable manner to achieve the homocoupling of hydrocarbon substrates.







Abstract
Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8722;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8722;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8722;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8722;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.

To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe-NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was designed to enable the two-phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)-O&#8722;Fe(III) complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and 9,10-dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; was identified as the major product in this C&#8722;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8722;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8722;C coupling product, achieving the complete two-phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high-valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free, two coordinate oxoborane (R&#8208;BO) has been isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3 and shown to react in a unique way with PhN3. In contrast to the parent oxoborane, the oxoborane&#8594;AlCl3 adduct is stable towards oligomerisation and C&#8722;H cleavage of the Mes* group as AlCl3 coordination provides thermodynamic stabilization while also reducing the basicity of the oxygen unit thus reducing the biphilic character of the BO unit.







Abstract
Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.

A strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, leading to an advanced human somatosensory network analogous piezoionic skin.







Abstract
Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressure&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1&#8197;kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2&#8197;Pa with a fast response time of 18.1&#8197;ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate arrayed pressure sensing with a PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin, analogous to the human somatosensory network. These capabilities hold great promises for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.

         <title>Flexible ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Helium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous and scalable ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes have been successfully fabricated on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer supports. The prepared ZSM&#8208;5 membranes exhibit high flexibility that allows helium separation from natural gas under various circumstances. The helium separation performance exceeds those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Flexible zeolite membranes are promising for scalable and adaptable separation of critical gases such as helium; however, the synthesis of such membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of crack&#8208;free ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports using a seeded growth method. PTFE&#8208;supported membranes exhibit unprecedented helium permeance of over 6.7&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 and high He/N2 and He/CH4 separation factors of 17 and 83 respectively, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. These flexible membranes maintain excellent separation performance even after bending and stretching. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale membranes demonstrate stable helium separation from multicomponent gas mixtures, showcasing their significant potential for practical helium extraction from natural gas.

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designable electrochemiluminescence patterning is achieved by focusing a 730&#8197;nm laser beam on the electrode surface. Through an in situ photothermal effect generated by the laser, which removes oxides formed by anodization, this approach enables enhanced bioimaging, highly sensitive immunoassays, and reversible luminescence&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.

         <title>Strontium Doped IrOx Triggers Direct O&#8722;O Coupling to Boost Acid Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)2&#8208;assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium&#8208;doped IrOx catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8722;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8722;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8722;IrOx catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8722;IrOx as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains excellent stability for over 500&#8197;hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions is crucial for the commercialization of proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers. In this work, we propose a Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-assisted method to fabricate a (200) facet highly exposed strontium-doped IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst to provide available adjacent iridium sites with lower Ir&#8722;O covalency. This design facilitates direct O&#8722;O coupling during the acidic water oxidation process, thereby circumventing the high energy barrier associated with the generation of *OOH intermediates. Benefiting from this advantage, the resulting Sr&#8722;IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits an impressive overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, a PEMWE device utilizing Sr&#8722;IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; as the anodic catalyst demonstrates a cell voltage of 1.72&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains excellent stability for over 500&#8197;hours. Our work not only provides guidance for the design of improved acidic OER catalysts but also encourages the development of iridium-based electrocatalysts with novel mechanisms for other electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Cu(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2) have been developed. Based on these emitters, efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were fabricated. It was also discovered that a magnetic field significantly suppresses the CP&#8208;TADF of chiral Cu(I) emitters.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether &#8220;Molecular Locks&#8221; for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) molecules were in&#8197;situ encapsulated within the sodalite cage of the ZIF&#8208;8 membranes to restrict their flexible pore structure. The resulting 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes exhibited exceptional C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, reaching 220, significantly surpassing most other membranes. Remarkably, as pressure increased, the separation factor continued to rise, achieving a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 at 7&#8197;bar.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7&#8197;bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96 mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of S/Kr&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in&#8208;situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective and Enantioselective Hydropyridylation of Dienes for the Synthesis of Chiral Diaryl Compounds via Concerted Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds, particularly those containing a pyridine moiety, is of significant interest due to their pharmaceutical applications. Here, we report the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hydropyridylation of conjugated dienes. Utilizing 2&#8208;fluoropyridine as the electrophile, CuOAc, and the chiral ligand Tol&#8208;BINAP, we optimized reaction conditions to achieve the desired chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl products containing both a pyridine and a cis&#8208;crotyl group. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the 1,2&#8208;hydrocupration step is enantio&#8208;determining, and the concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution proceeds via six&#8208;membered cyclic transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Integrated Electrocatalyst on Oxygen Conversion for Highly Durable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key for clean energy applications such as rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts have been the focus of great attention by scientists. Here, an innovative and continuous growth method is established to fabricate integrated Janus structure Co3O4/CoNGDY catalyst, which can work for bifunctional oxygen catalytic conversion, achieving highly durable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Embedded in the hydrangea&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped graphdiyne (NGDY), the Co3O4/CoNGDY is self&#8208;organized by CoNGDY at the NGDY contact sites and Co3O4 at the upper part, in which Co3O4 works as OER catalyst and CoNGDY acts as ORR catalyst. Due to the incomplete charge transfer within integrated structure, NGDY reduces the d&#8208;band center of the Co sites, so the adsorption strength of intermediates is balanced, and the catalytic activity for ORR/OER is increased. The Co3O4/CoNGDY can serve as an efficient air electrode of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. The rechargeable Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrate excellent performance with a high specific capacity of 746.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and an extremely long lifetime of more than 5000 hours. The recoverable modularized cylindrical Co3O4/CoNGDY&#8208;based solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries with a power density of up to 167.6 mW cm&#8722;2 can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;level Modulation of N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value&#8208;added products through benzylic C&#8212;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly strategy towards molecular&#8208;level&#160;fabrication of co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N&#160;and&#160;S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition. The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97% ethylbenzene conversion and 98% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doping leads to&#160;the&#160;redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular&#8208;level design of carbon&#8208;based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom&#8208;doping on catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic Organic Micro&#8208;Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents the first demonstration of a mechanochromic organic micro&#8208;laser, which exhibits remarkable wide range pressure sensing characteristics. The gain material, pinacolato boronate ester functionalized anthanthrene (AnBPin), is designed by incorporating mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties into organic laser dye. The AnBPin exhibits a reversible transition between green and orange fluorescence upon grinding annealing and recrystallization cycle, and its micro&#8208;crystal exhibits typical organic micro&#8208;laser behaviors. Applying localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1 MPa inhibits micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot. In contrast, under 1 to 2 GPa hydrostatic pressure, the organic laser maintains narrow emission while showing a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in emission wavelength. By combining theory and experimentation, we attribute the unusual pressure&#8208;correlated emission spectroscopy to the unique interleaved locked crystal structure. Understanding the mechanochromic laser behavior in AnBPin micro&#8208;crystals under an unprecedented pressure range significantly expands the family of organic micro&#8208;lasers and provides a new route for wide&#8208;range photonic pressure detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction&#160;and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks.&#160; The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar 2D&#8208;nanosheets covalent organic framework (I&#8208;TTA COF), whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (I&#8208;TG COP) with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134 mV for HER (in 0.5 M H2SO4) and ~283 mV for OER (in 1 M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24 hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g mol&#8208;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Chemical Repair of Etheno&#8208;Type RNA Damages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Etheno damages in RNA represent a unique class of structural alterations that arise from exposure to various environmental stressors or endogenous processes. They significantly distort the RNA structure and affect crucial biological functions, including RNA&#8208;protein interactions, ribosome function, and translation fidelity. However, repair mechanisms for those etheno damages in RNA are still being elucidated. Here, a synthetic flavin derivative PS9 has been identified as the first example of chemical repair approach for this type of RNA damages. It efficiently managed the removal of etheno&#8208;type &#949;A and &#949;C damages in nucleosides, oligonucleotides in vitro, and in E. coli RNA in vivo under blue light irradiation. The capacity of the chemical approach relies on a unique cycloaddition activation of the etheno&#8208;bridge with singlet oxygen, which is distinct from traditional epoxidation of the C=C double bonds by proteins from the AlkB family. The understanding and effective manipulation of etheno damages in RNA with chemical tools hold implications for deciphering their role in mutagenesis and RNA biology, potentially opening avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce3+/Ce4+ Ion Redox Shuttle Stabilized Cu&#948;+ for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2+ products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8208;C coupling process, the Cu&#948;+ species suitable for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy (Ce/CuOx) to protect the Cu&#948;+ state in the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40% for C2H4, 14% for CH3CH2OH, and 6% for CH3COOH), and 25 h stability at &#8208;1.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ XPS combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides an idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals to maintain the stability of dynamic Cu&#948;+ state and improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Strategy for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Branched Human Milk Oligosaccharides Containing the Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exhibit prebiotic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties and confer significant benefits to infants. Branched HMOs are constructed through diverse glycosidic linkages and prominently feature the lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB, Gal&#8208;&#946;1,3&#8208;GlcNAc) motif with fucose and/or sialic acid modifications, displaying structural complexity that surpasses that of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycans. However, synthesizing comprehensive libraries of branched HMO is challenging due to this complexity. Although a few systematic synthetic strategies have emerged, many of them rely on labor&#8208;intensive chemical methodologies or exploit the substrate specificity of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (hGCNT2). In this study, we capitalized on the substrate promiscuities of hGCNT2 and bacterial glycosyltransferases (GTs) to construct a universal tetrasaccharide core in a highly efficient manner. This core was systematically and flexibly extended to generate diverse branched HMOs utilizing the promiscuity of bacterial GTs coupled with N&#8208;trifluoroacetyl glucosamine (GlcNTFA), which facilitated sugar chain elongation. The GlcNTFA residues were subsequently converted into various N&#8208;modified glucosamines through straightforward chemical manipulations to modulate the activities of additional GTs during glycan extension. These masked amino groups were ultimately reverted to N&#8208;acetyl groups, facilitating the synthesis of a broad range of asymmetric and multiantennary HMOs featuring LNB moieties, including many previously inaccessible structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Pt&#8208;Encrusted RuCu Nanocages Optimizing OH Adsorption for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the best candidates for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), ruthenium (Ru) has attracted significant attention for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), although it suffers from sluggish kinetics under alkaline conditions due to its strong hydroxide affinity. In this work, we develop ternary hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy on RuCu (Pt&#8208;RuCu NCs) as efficient HOR catalysts for application in AEMFCs. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the synergy in optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs significantly modifies the electronic structure and coordination environment of Ru, thereby balancing the binding strengths of H* and OH* species, which leads to a markedly enhanced HOR performance. Specifically, the optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C achieves a mass activity of 5.91 A mgPt+Ru&#8208;1, which is ~3.3, ~2.2, and ~15.0 times higher than that of RuCu NCs/C (1.38 A mgRu&#8208;1), PtRu/C (1.83 A mgPt+Ru&#8208;1) and Pt/C (0.37 A mgPt&#8208;1), respectively. Impressively, the specific peak power density of fuel cells reaches 15.9 W mgPt+Ru&#8208;1, significantly higher than those of most reported PtRu&#8208;based fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Heterobidentate Coordination of 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridine Leading to Remarkably Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Zn(C5H4NO)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unconventional heterobidentate coordination mode of conventional 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand in a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2. The strong heterobidentate coordination interactions between Zn2+ and 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands promote a uniform alignment of the polarization of each [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral building unit, resulting in remarkably strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) with an intensity that is the largest among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds, reaching 13.6 &#215; KDP. Moreover, Zn(C5H4NO)2 processes a suitable optical bandgap of 4.40 eV, high thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C, excellent air stability, and strong water resistance, demonstrating great application potential. Additionally, Zn(C5H4NO)2 exhibits photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced lifetime of 558 ms, accompanied by a rare blue afterglow visible to the naked eye, lasting up to 5 s.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Oxidative Atom and Group Transfer Reactions at a Well&#8208;Defined Uranium(II) Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M = K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand) and K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)) with pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X = O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8211;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low&#8208;temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The multi-electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two-electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well-defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M = K(2,2,2-cryptand) and K(18-crown-6)(THF)) with pyridine-N-oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X = O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8211;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low-temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate. These uranium(IV)&#8211;element multiply bound compounds were fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, solution magnetic susceptibility, and elemental analysis.

         <title>H Induced Metal&#8208;Insulation Transition Boosts the Stability of High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanded range of hydrogen sources and simplified management systems. However, the frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD)&#160;caused fuel starvation&#160;operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell.&#160;In this manuscript, VO2&#160;was incorporated in the anode&#160;to restrain fuel starvation&#160;of the electrode. Under the operation condition, the insulative VO2&#160;would reversibly&#160;transform into metallic HxVO2&#160;by&#160;intercalating hydrogen, and HxVO2&#160;can automatically release hydrogen,&#160;which&#160;could&#160;act as the hydrogen buffer&#160;and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. After the hydrogen release, the generated insulating VO2&#160;would prevent the&#160;side reactions during fuel starvation.&#160;Compared&#160;to the traditional&#160;Pt anode, the electrode&#160;with VO2&#160;showed much higher&#160;output power&#160;and greatly improved durability after fuel starvation. This work demonstrates the in&#8208;situ&#160;reversible hydrogen storage/release&#8208;controlled metal&#8208;insulator phase transition strategy to enhance the durability of fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Confinement and Microenvironment of Ru Clusters Stably Confined in MFI Zeolite for Efficient Propane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by encapsulating noble metal species within zeolites is highly promising for high utilization and cost efficiency in thermal and environmental catalytic reactions. Ru considered an economical noble metal alternative with comparable performance, faces great challenges within MFI&#8208;type microporous zeolites due to its high cohesive energy and mobility. Herein, an innovative strategy was explored coupling hydrothermal in situ ligand protection with stepwise calcination in a flowing atmosphere to embed ultrasmall Ru clusters anchored at K+&#8208;healed silanol sites (&#8801;Si&#8211;Ru&#948;+&#8208;O&#8208;K complexes) within 10&#8208;membered ring sinusoidal channels of MFI. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the interplay between confined Ru clusters and MFI induces local strain in MFI, creating a unique catalytic microenvironment around the Ru clusters. This synergy exhibits superior alkane deep oxidation, performance owing to the confined Ru clusters and the MFI microenvironment collectively pre&#8208;activate C3H8 and O2, facilitate the cleavage of C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds at low temperatures. Notably, the stable geometric and electronic properties of confined Ru show exceptional thermal stability up to 1000 &#176;C, rivaling fresh catalysts. These findings shed vital methodological and mechanistic insights for developing efficacious heterogeneous catalysts for thermal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N&#8208;coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co&#8208;N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99% yields) at 80 oC under 0.5 MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8208;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Bistability of Magnetic Susceptibility, Light Absorption, Second Harmonic Generation, and Dielectric Properties in a Polar Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron&#8211;Rhenium Chain Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bistability of multiple physical properties driven by external stimuli in a solid is a desired prerequisite for its application in memory devices with convenient data readout. We present a pathway for thermal bistability detectable in four physical properties: magnetic, light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and dielectric. We report a novel heterometallic (TBA){[FeII(phIN)4][ReV(CN)8]}&#183;(phIN) (1) (TBA = tetrabutylammonium cation, phIN = phenyl isonicotinate) cyanido&#8208;bridged chain material. Owing to an appropriate {N6} coordination sphere of Fe(II) centers, 1 reveals a thermal spin crossover (SCO) effect which is complete and cooperative providing a distinct thermal hysteresis loop in magnetic measurements. Moreover, it exhibits simultaneous thermal bistability in (a) visible&#8208;light absorption due to the presence of efficient d&#8208;d electronic transitions in the low&#8208;spin (LS) state, (b) SHG activity as it crystallizes in a polar Cc space group due to the bulky substituent on phIN ligands, and (c) dielectric parameters, including dielectric constant, which can be correlated with subtle changes in polarity between LS and HS (high spin) phases. Thus, we present a remarkable thermally controlled hysteretic behavior in four physical functionalities realized by properly functionalizing an SCO&#8208;active coordination compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudohalide Anions Driven Structural Modulation in Distorted Tetrahedral Manganese(II) Hybrids toward Tunable Green&#8208;Red Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn(II)&#8208;based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8208;x (R= phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P = triphenylphosphine; x = 1 &#8208; 3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green&#8208;emitting A2MnBr4 (512 nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4&#8208;X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549 ~ 613 nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#183;&#183;&#183;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mn(II)-based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4-x (R= phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P = triphenylphosphine; x = 1 - 3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green-emitting A2MnBr4 (512 nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4-X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549 ~ 613 nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#183;&#183;&#183;Mn distance.

         <title>Ethane Triggered Gate&#8208;Opening in a Flexible&#8722;Robust Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;high Purity Ethylene Purification</title>

         <dc:description>Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high&#8208;concentration ethylene mixtures instead of traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report the ethane triggered gate&#8208;opening in the flexible&#8208;robust metal&#8722;organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3&#8208;methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecule, thus achieving the unprecedent ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#160;cm3 g&#8208;1) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low&#8208;pressure region (0.1 bar and 298 K). The ethane&#8208;induced structural transition behavior is uncovered by a collaboration of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in&#8208;situ variable pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross&#8208;section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor&#8208;made pore channels. Dynamic breakthrough experiments revealed the outstanding separation performance of Zn(ad)(min) in the production of ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt; 99.995%) with a productivity of up to 39.2 L/kg under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Moir&#233; Lattice of Twisted Bilayer Graphene as Template for Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree of non&#8208;covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with twist angles varying between ~5&#176;&#160;and 7&#176;&#160;was non&#8208;covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11&#8208;hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy, where areas with larger twist angles exhibited a lower HATCN peak intensity compared to areas with smaller twist angles. We suggest that the HATCN adsorption follows the moir&#233; pattern of tBLG by avoiding AA&#8208;stacked areas and attach predominantly to areas with a local AB&#8208;stacking order of tBLG, forming an overall ABA&#8208;stacking configuration. This is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our work highlights the role of the moir&#233; lattice in controlling the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of tBLG. Our approach can be generalized for designing nanoscale patterns on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials using moir&#233; structures as a template. This could facilitate the fabrication of nanoscale devices with locally controlled varying chemical functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a&#160;Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) also poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2&#160;is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2&#160;adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in an Au(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz = pyrazine;&#160;1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network.&#160;Ex situ&#160;single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for&#160;1&#160;and CS2&#160;accommodated&#160;1&#160;suggested that the Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2&#160;modulating the Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2&#160;and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure.&#160;Based on the obtained structural formation,&#160;1&#160;exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2&#160;with an ultrafast response time of less than 10 s. Ex situ&#160;time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2&#160;varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative active sites on Ag2Pt3TiS6 for enhanced low&#8208;temperature ammonia fuel cell electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia has attracted considerable interest as a hydrogen carrier that can help decarbonize global energy networks. Key to realizing this is the development of low temperature ammonia fuel cells for the on&#8208;demand generation of electricity. However, the efficiency of such systems is significantly impaired by the sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the design of a bifunctional Ag2Pt3TiS6 electrocatalyst that facilitates both reactions at activities exceeding that of commercial Pt/C. Through comprehensive density functional theory simulations, we identify that active site motifs composed of Pt and Ti atoms work cooperatively to catalyze ORR and AOR. Notably, in&#8208;situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments indicate a decreased propensity for *NOx formation and hence an increased resistance toward catalyst poisoning for AOR. Employing Ag2Pt3TiS6 as both the cathode and anode, we constructed a low temperature ammonia fuel cell with a high peak power density of 8.71 mW cm&#8208;2 and low Pt loading of 0.45 mg cm&#8208;2. Our findings demonstrate a pathway towards the rational design of effective electrocatalysts with multi&#8208;element active sites that work cooperatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Transmembrane Delivery of an Aryl Azopyrazole Photo&#8208;switchable Ion Transporter Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive synthetic ionophores allow for spatial and temporal control over ion transport, with promise for applications in targeted therapy. Relay transporters have emerged as a new class of ion transporters &#8208; these are anchored carriers that sit in both leaflets of the bilayer and mediate transport across the membrane by passing ions between them. The relays are themselves membrane impermeable, and so must be incorporated into the membrane during vesicle preparation. Here we show that relay transporters can be delivered to both sides of the membrane of vesicles using a synthetic flippase. By incorporating an aryl azopyrazole photo&#8208;switch into the movable arm of the relay transporters the ion transport activity can be very efficiently and reversibly switched between off and on states. This control is achieved by extension and contraction of their movable arms via photo&#8208;isomerization of the central aryl azopyrazole moiety, hence modulating the ability of the relays to pass ions across the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize NIR chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can&#8217;t switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Nitrogen Functionalization of Isostructural 2D Conjugated MOFs for Enhancement of the Dual&#8208;Ion Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. However, a viable path to realize superior dual&#8208;ion storage in 2D c&#8208;MOFs has remained elusive. Here, we report the synthesis of Cu2(Nx&#8208;OHPTP) 2D c&#8208;MOFs (x=0,1,2; OHPTP=octahydroxyphenanthrotriphenylene) with precise aromatic carbon&#8208;nitrogen arrangements, based on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated OHPTP ligand incorporated with one or two nitrogen atoms. The skeletal nitrogen modification in Cu2(Nx&#8208;OHPTP) allows the synergistic introduction of additional redox sites, and thus substantially favors the unique dual&#8208;ion adsorption capacity. Consequently, the Cu2(N2&#8208;OHPTP) cathode exhibits a largely enhanced electrochemical performance for dual&#8208;ion storage (i.e., Li+ and Cl&#8208;) with a high specific capacity of 53.8 mAh g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Cu2(N0&#8208;OHPTP) and 1.3 times that of Cu2(N1&#8208;OHPTP). Furthermore, the Cu2(N2&#8208;OHPTP) electrode displays a favorable rate performance of 52% and good cycling stability of 96% after 1000 cycles. We identify N&#8208;centered redox sites as additional Li+ adsorption sites. In addition, calculations underline the synergistic enhancement of the Cl&#8722; adsorption energy by about 1.0 eV at the more electron&#8208;poor CuO4 linkages after N&#8208;incorporation. This work paves the way for the precise design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with superior electrochemical properties, advancing their application in dual&#8208;ion storage applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here an electrocatalyst that exhibits superior performance in the electrooxidation of ethanol. The reactive centers of the catalyst have a nest&#8208;type configuration with outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest covering inner PtZn intermetallic compound nanoparticle loaded on carbon support (ZnNC&#8834;PtZn/C). The high&#8208;energy stepped facets of the inner PtZn nanoparticle confined and shaped by the outer Zn&#8208;NxC nest is highly active for the critical C&#8208;C bond cleavage of ethanol in oxidation, confirmed by experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The catalyst shows a rare high&#8208;performance and demonstrates a mass activity of 3.7 A mgPt&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 78.2%, following the C1 pathway of reaction and the retention of initial activity remains 97% after 5,000 cycles. The unique configuration, also mitigating the concentration polarization, endows the catalyst with innate ethanol electrooxidation property by inner&#8208;outer synergic interactions, leading to unexpected power output of an acidic direct ethanol fuel cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design for Balanced Locally Excited and Charge&#8208; Transfer Nature for Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Phenomenon and Highly Efficient TADF&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) character is hampered by the concurrent achievement of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL). Here, by introducing a terephthalonitrile unit into a sterically crowded donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structure, inducing a hybrid electronic excitation character, we designed unique TADF emitters possessing 2PA ability. This rational molecular design was achieved through a main &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor backbone in line with locally excited feature renders a large oscillator strength and transition dipole moment, maintaining a high 2PA cross&#8208;section value. The ancillary N&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor with charge transfer character highly balances the TADF phenomenon by minimizing &#916;EST. A near&#8208;unity &#1060;PL value with a large radiative decay rate over an order of magnitude higher than the intersystem crossing rate and a high horizontal orientation ratio of 0.95 were simultaneously attained for TPCz2NP. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with this material exhibit a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4% with an elevated 2PA cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) value up to 143&#160;GM at 850 nm. These findings offer a venue for designing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional performance inclusive of 2PA properties, expanding for future functional material design.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Molecule Functionalization Enables Selective Electrochemical Reduction of Dilute CO2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3% at 300 mA cm&#8208;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15% CO2) at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30 h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonds Enable Efficient Photoreduction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ab initio molecular dynamics and excited&#8208;state calculations we demonstrate that the formation of chalcogen bonds between hydrosulfide anions and an organic heteroaromatic chromophore containing a sulfur atom enables efficient photoinduced electron transfer and photoreduction.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanocatalytic antioxidation approach is proposed for alcoholic liver injury therapy by developing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with a desirable hepatic passive targeting ability, as well as a high catalytic antioxidative activity, resulting in an efficient and sustainable ROS&#8208;scavenging effect in the liver.







Abstract
The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km=59.31&#8197;mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5&#8201;% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side chain phenyl positional isomerization induces strong intermolecular spatial conjugation, simultaneously improving the fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties of phototheranostic agents in the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained o&#8208;ITNP NPs excels in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy.







Abstract
The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;labeling protein tag in combination with exchangeable fluorophore ligands bypasses photobleaching and enables long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule imaging in living cells. This extends observation times in single cells and enables direct monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor activation in living cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30&#8197;minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER&#8208;luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.

         <title>Single crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Frameworks Showing Versatile Fluorescence Depending on Composition Ratios and Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis, characterization and photobehavior of single crystalline non&#8208;stoichiometric hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (NS&#8208;HOFs). NS&#8208;HOFs (BTNT&#8208;1) with various composition ratios were successfully obtained as single crystals from two analogue tetratopic carboxylic acids, possessing naphthalene and benzothiadiazole cores NTTA and BTTA, respectively. The heterogeneous distribution of the components was thoroughly confirmed by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence microscopy and focused synchrotron X&#8208;ray radiation techniques, for the first time. The versatile fluorescence of BTNT&#8208;1 behavior depends on the composition ratio and distribution of the component in the single crystals. We observed not only fluorescence bands with various colors such as purple, blue, green and white, depending on the composition ratio of both components in BTNT&#8208;1, but also different emission bands from a single crystal. Furthermore, we provide details on their emission lifetimes following the composition, emission color and targeted region on the crystal. These results demonstrate unique and versatile optical properties of carboxylic acid&#8208;based NS&#8208;HOFs and provide a concept of creating functional mixed porous materials capable of different and tunable optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8208;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.</dc:description>

         <title>Examining the Impact of 3D Multi&#8208;Arm Small Molecules on PM6:Y6 Blend Reveals the Key Requirements for Their Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the emergence of PM6:Y6 active layer re&#8208;energized the organic photovoltaic community, excessive aggregation of Y6 molecules induced by their strong intermolecular interactions has limited the performance of PM6:Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). Adding 3D multi&#8208;arm small&#8208;molecule acceptors is an effective strategy to inhibit such aggregation. However, to maximize OSC efficiency, these molecules should also contribute to the electronic processes. Here, by taking a benzotriazole&#8208;based 3D four&#8208;arm small molecule (i.e., SF&#8208;BTA1) as representative example, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations to examine the molecular&#8208;scale impact of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules on morphological characteristics (especially at the nanoscale) and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends. By considering the intermolecular packing distances, density, and patterns among PM6, Y6, and SF&#8208;BTA1 components, exciton transfer rates from SF&#8208;BTA1 to Y6 or PM6, charge transfer rates from Y6 or PM6 to SF&#8208;BTA1, electron/hole transfer rates among adjacent Y6/PM6 pairs, and radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, we draw a comprehensive picture that describes how 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules improve morphological and electronic properties of PM6:Y6 blends and thus the OSC efficiency. Furthermore, successful rationalization of these aspects allows us to point out key requirements regarding the electronic properties of 3D multi&#8208;arm small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Regulation of Sensitizers and Cluster Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8208;Sb9@UiO&#8208;Ir&#8208;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8208;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34 times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8208;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8208;Sb9@UiO&#8208;Ir&#8208;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Locking up G&#8208;quadruplexes with light&#8208;triggered staples leads to increased topological, thermodynamic, and metabolic stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary, tetraplexed DNA structures abundant in non&#8208;coding regions of the genome, implicated in gene transcription processes and currently firmly recognised as important potential therapeutic targets. Given their affinity for human proteins, G4 structures are investigated as potential decoys and aptamers. However, G4s tend to adopt different conformations depending on the exact environmental conditions, and often only one displays the specifically desired biological activity. Their less intensively studied counterparts, the elusive tetraplexed intercalated&#8208;motifs (IMs) are typically unstable at neutral pH, hampering the investigation of their potential involvement in a biological context. We herein report on a photochemical method for &#8220;stapling&#8221; such tetraplexed&#8208;structures, to increase their stability, lock their topology and enhance their enzymatic resistance, while maintaining biological activity. The chemical structure and topology of the stapled Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA) was spectroscopically characterised and rationalised in silico. The method was then extended to other biologically relevant G4&#8208; and IM&#8208;prone sequences, hinting towards potential application of such stapled structures in a therapeutic context.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Deep Learning Search for Exceptional Chiroptical Properties? The Halogenated [6]Helicene Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have focused on one of the most important chiral motifs, [6]helicene, and we have predicted the effect of halogenation on its chiroptical properties using Deep Learning. We have developed three machine learning models, which allow us to evaluate millions of compounds and learn the reasons that favor some substitutions. With the knowledge gained, we synthesized the most favored candidates, exhibiting the predicted properties.







Abstract
The relationship between chemical structure and chiroptical properties is not always clearly understood. Nowadays, efforts to develop new systems with enhanced optical properties follow the trial&#8208;error method. A large number of data would allow us to obtain more robust conclusions and guide research toward molecules with practical applications. In this sense, in this work we predict the chiroptical properties of millions of halogenated [6]helicenes in terms of the rotatory strength (R). We have used DFT calculations to randomly create derivatives including from 1 to 16 halogen atoms, that were then used as a data set to train different deep neural network models. These models allow us to i) predict the Rmax for any halogenated [6]helicene with a very low computational cost, and ii) to understand the physical reasons that favour some substitutions over others. Finally, we synthesized derivatives with higher predicted Rmax obtaining excellent correlation among the values obtained experimentally and the predicted ones.

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reaction strategy is applied to regulate compressive strain at CsPbI3 surface. The synergistic effect of chemical bonding and strain regulation suppresses interface recombination and phase transition, leading to enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% and promising operational stability with T99 over 2000&#8197;h at MPP tracking which represents one of the most stable wide band gap PSCs.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0&#8201;% and 18.6&#8201;% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% R.&#8197;H. air) for 2000&#8197;h, and remain 99&#8201;% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Indole N&#8208;Linked Hydroperoxyl Adduct of Protein&#8208;Derived Cofactor Modulating Catalase&#8208;Peroxidase Functions</title>

Catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW&#8208;OOH (golden color). MYW&#8208;OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.

         <title>Loading Dyes into Chiral Cd/Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sizes of chiral MOFs can be controlled from sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m to over 7&#8197;mm by tuning the types and additional amounts of organic dyes. The full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence MOFs are synthesized by different dyes encapsulation, which are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has endowed them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), it is still limited for MOFs to systematically tune full&#8208;color CPL emissions and sizes. This work directionally assembles the chiral ligands, metal sites and organic dyes to prepare a series of crystalline enantiomeric D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n MOFs (n=1~5, representing the adding amount of dyes), where D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn with the formula of Cd2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) and Zn2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) (D/L&#8208;Cam=D/L&#8208;camphoric acid, TPyPE=4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;henediidenetetra&#8208;4,1&#8208;phenylene)tetrakis[pyridine]) were used as the chiral platforms. The framework&#8208;dye&#8208;enabled emission and through&#8208;space chirality transfer facilitate D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n bright full&#8208;color CPL activity. The ideal yellow CPL of D&#8208;Cd&#8208;5 and D&#8208;Zn&#8208;4, with |glum| as 4.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and relatively high photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.79&#8201;% and 45.40&#8201;%, are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode. The crystal sizes of D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n were found to be strongly correlated to the types and additional amounts of organic dyes, that the positive organic dyes allow for the preparation of &gt;&#8201;7&#8197;mm bulks and negative dyes account for sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m particles. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate full&#8208;color emissive CPL composites and provides a potentially universal method for controlling the size of optical platforms.

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA origami&#8208;based biosensor for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery using single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET). The hydrophobic ATTO647N&#8208;modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash on the sensor detects vesicle binding via FRET changes and delivers molecular cargo through triggered strand displacement reaction. This platform offers innovative applications in biosensing and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles.







Abstract
Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general deborylative cyanation protocol representative of an enantioconvergent cross&#8208;nucleophile coupling platform. Mechanistic study suggests the formation of prochiral alkyl radicals via aniline&#8208;assisted single&#8208;electron activation of organoboron species. Electronic structure analysis of the reactive CuII(CN)2 complex indicates a significant amount of ligand&#8208;based radical density.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.

         <title>Chemical Recording of Pump&#8208;Specific Drug Efflux in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p&#8208;glycoprotein, respectively.







Abstract
Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micro&#8208;Mesopore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing zeolite micro&#8208;mesopore diffusion optimization, this study engineers a bifunctional catalytic system that achieves 94.0&#8201;% conversion of plastic waste into liquid alkanes, with 84.8&#8201;% in the C5&#8722;C7 range, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity for upcycling of polymers into high&#8208;value fuels.







Abstract
Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion has emerged as a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a wide carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we present a bifunctional catalytic system consisting of &#946; zeolite mixed hierarchical Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, designed for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a 94.0&#8201;% yield of liquid alkane, with 84.8&#8201;% of C5&#8722;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, by optimizing the micro&#8208;mesopores of Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, the scaling relationship between the pore structure and the conversion/selectivity is identified. The rapid diffusion of olefins within these micro&#8208;mesopores significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA) proved to be a universal and highly selective recognition group for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species, overcoming the long&#8208;standing issues of aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based probes. DANBA can be combined with diverse hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores to obtain ONOO&#8722; sensing probes with different spectral emissions. A DANBA and malononitrile fluorophore&#8208;based probe detected subtle changes in the ONOO&#8722; levels of mouse brains with Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8722; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; species depends on the ONOO&#8722; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8722; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8722; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; over that of their control group, as well as universality in solution assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8722; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson's disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8722; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in complex biological systems and processes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Polymer Membranes with Intrinsic Microporosity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) containing hydrophilic Tr&#246;ger's base groups were coated as ultrathin selective membranes on zinc metal anodes to regulate the ion transport and electrochemical reactions at interfaces. The PIM membranes regulate the zinc ion transport and effectively mitigate zinc dendrite growth, as well as reduce corrosive side reactions, leading to safe and stable zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
Metallic zinc has emerged as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy battery systems due to its high theoretical capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low redox potential for two&#8208;electron reactions, cost&#8208;effectiveness and inherent safety. However, current zinc metal batteries face challenges in low coulombic efficiency and limited longevity due to uncontrollable dendrite growth, the corrosive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decomposition of the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, we report an interfacial&#8208;engineering approach to mitigate dendrite growth and reduce corrosive reactions through the design of ultrathin selective membranes coated on the zinc anodes. The submicron&#8208;thick membranes derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), featuring pores with tunable interconnectivity, facilitate regulated transport of Zn2+&#8208;ions, thereby promoting a uniform plating/stripping process. Benefiting from the protection by PIM membranes, zinc symmetric cells deliver a stable cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh while full cells with NaMnO2 cathode operate stably at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 300&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. Our work represents a new strategy of preparing multi&#8208;functional membranes that can advance the development of safe and stable zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Patterns in Non&#8208;Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non&#8208;reciprocal active interactions self&#8208;organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self&#8208;organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient modelling of the economically impactful enzyme, TxtE, has been probed, in which indole (tryptophan mimic) nitration was observed by a putative heme&#8208;peroxynitrite intermediate, resembling one of the prime enzymatic mechanistic proposals. Experimental and theoretical exploration of the mechanism reveal a unique reaction landscape dictated by NO2 radical species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide (NO) and dioxygen (O2) as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8722;&#8901;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Accessing Therapeutically&#8208;Relevant Multifunctional Antisense Oligonucleotide Conjugates Using Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide and carbohydrate&#8208;antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) conjugates containing clinically&#8208;relevant phosphorothioate (PS) and locked&#8208;nucleic acid (LNA) backbone modifications are efficiently prepared using native chemical ligation. Chemoselective post&#8208;ligation modification of ASO conjugates is accomplished using radical desulfurization and cysteine modification chemistry to deliver valuable multifunctional constructs.







Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies hold significant promise in the realm of molecular medicine. By precisely targeting RNA molecules, ASOs offer an approach to modulate gene expression and protein production, making them valuable tools for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. As the precise intracellular targeting and delivery of ASOs is challenging, strategies for preparing ASO&#8208;ligand conjugates are in exceedingly high demand. This work leverages the utility of native chemical ligation to conjugate ASOs with therapeutically relevant chemical modifications including locked nucleic acids and phosphorothioate backbone modifications to peptides and sugars via a stable amide linkage. A suite of post&#8208;ligation functionalizations through modification of the cysteine ligation handle are highlighted, including chemoselective radical desulfurization, lipidation, and alkylation with a range of valuable handles (e.g. alkyne, biotin, and radionuclide chelating ligands), affording multifunctional constructs for further applications in biology and medicine. Application of the methodology to a clinically&#8208;relevant triantennary&#8208;GalNAc ASO conjugate and validation of its binding and functional activity underpins the applicability of the technique to oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers such as polyaniline are promising polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization. They are tunable, can be functionalized, and their unpaired electrons can be hyperpolarized by chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity. We show solid&#8208;state dynamic nuclear polarization of polyaniline at liquid helium temperatures with an intriguing mechanism crossover as radical concentration is increased.







Abstract
The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2&#8197;K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report 1H polarizations of up to 5&#8201;%. We also show that 13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spin hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The obtained CoGa intermetallic compounds with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure and isolated electron&#8208;rich Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) process, thus significantly improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8722;Ga, Ni&#8722;Ga, Pt&#8722;Ga, Pd&#8722;Ga, and Rh&#8722;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The obtained CoGa intermetallic compounds with body-centered cubic (&lt;i&gt;bcc&lt;/i&gt;) structure and isolated electron-rich Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the potential-determining step in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) process, thus significantly improving the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity and selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal-Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal-Ga IMCs, including Co&#8722;Ga, Ni&#8722;Ga, Pt&#8722;Ga, Pd&#8722;Ga, and Rh&#8722;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body-centered cubic (&lt;i&gt;bcc&lt;/i&gt;) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O-CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron-rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Absorbance&#8208;Activated Droplet Sorting for Engineering Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorting platform was developed for library screening. Absorbance in picoliter droplets is measured using a lithographic mask, with sorted droplets identified by impedance detection. This method allows sensitive detection and sorting at kHz rates. The efficiency of the platform is demonstrated by screening a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library, yielding a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the direct reuse of spent LiFePO4 electrodes is developed by simply soaking the spent electrodes in a lithiation reagent solution at room temperature for 6&#8197;min. Being reused directly, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed in air for 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1&#8197;M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6&#8197;minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed to air for 3&#8197;months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azapeptides are highly structured and protease resistant peptidomimetics that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids. A single atom change in 3.5&#8197;kDa peptides from C&#945; to N&#945; was used to generate equipotent GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR mono agonists, and a unimolecular dual agonist. All azapeptide analogues were fully refractory to the front&#8208;line protease, DPP4, that degrades GLP&#8208;1 and GIP within minutes.







Abstract
The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles including glucose homeostasis and appetite suppression. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and dual agonists of GLP&#8208;1R and GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles. Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide makes them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors. This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variation that may influence downstream signaling.

         <title>Triphasic Hydroxysilylation of Alkenes by Mechanically Piezoelectric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy for the 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of both activated and unactivated alkenes using silylboronate and oxygen gas, facilitated by piezoelectric materials (Li2TiO3) serving as a redox catalyst in a triphasic catalytic system is introduced. This approach offers multiple advantages, including a brief reaction time of 30 minutes, solvent&#8208;free conditions, catalyst recyclability, and the avoidance of the need for strong base activation of silylboronate or external reductants.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes is crucial for synthesizing organosilicon compounds which are key intermediates in material science, pharmaceuticals, and organic synthesis. The development of strategies employing hydrogen atom transfer pathways is currently hindered by the existence of various competing reactions. Herein, we reported a novel mechanochemical strategy for the triphasic 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes through a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer pathway. Our approach not only circumvents competitive reactions to enable the first&#8208;ever 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of unactivated alkenes but also pioneers the research in mechanic force&#8208;induced triphasic reactions under ambient conditions. This gentle method offers excellent compatibility with various functional groups, operates under simple and solvent&#8208;free conditions, ensures rapid reaction time. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that silylboronate can be transformed to a silicon radical by highly polarized Li2TiO3 particles and oxygen under ball&#8208;milling condition.

Herein, we reported a novel mechanochemical strategy for the triphasic 1,2-hydroxysilylation of alkenes through a single-electron-transfer pathway. Our approach not only circumvents competitive reactions to enable the first-ever 1,2-hydroxysilylation of unactivated alkenes but also pioneers the research in mechanic force-induced triphasic reactions under ambient conditions. This gentle method offers excellent compatibility with various functional groups, operates under simple and solvent-free conditions, ensures rapid reaction time. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that silylboronate can be transformed to a silicon radical by highly polarized Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; particles and oxygen under ball-milling condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>25.71&#8201;%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by A Thiourea&#8208;based Isomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, thiourea isomer derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB) were developed. It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb2+ through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT&#8208;treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the PSCs, we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818&#8197;eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8722;NH&#8722; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015&#8197;eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% (certified as 24.66&#8201;%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74&#8201;%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05&#8201;%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0&#8201;% and 95.2&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000&#8197;h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas signaling molecule&#8208;responsive artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based switches (GRAS) have been developed as H2S&#8208;driven nanodevices for manipulating cellular functions. GRAS is highly programmable and versatile, enabling the customization of user&#8208;defined H2S signaling inputs to down&#8208;regulate mRNA expression and activate RTK signaling pathways at various subcellular levels, thereby allowing for precise regulation of cell behavior.







Abstract
The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios. Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>

An atom&#8208;efficient domino strategy maximizing the yield of non&#8208;phenolic dealkylated aromatics from the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif by one&#8208;pot catalytic cascade, consisting of selective dehydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;carbinol group, retro&#8208;aldol to cleave C&#8722;C bonds, and decarbonylation of the generated aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, a subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction that cleaves the C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond, followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75&#8201;% selectivity for 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers, alongside syngas (CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2&#8776;1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through an enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

&lt;p&gt;The stable Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NUS-8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template-assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c-MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c-MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template-assisted strategy for constructing MOF-on-MOF (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NUS-8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamino-tri (p-phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS-8, we achieve the controllable self-assembly of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on NUS-8 nanosheets, producing solution-processable Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NUS-8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large-area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NUS-8-based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NUS-8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NUS-8 and the redox reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;switching strategy for in situ formulating stationary or removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in ESE&#8208;NiOOH is developed with ultrahigh selectivity for electrocatalytic upgrading of aromatic secondary alcohols via direct dehydrogenation to acetophenones or C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage to benzoic acids. Precisely modulating lattice&#8208;oxygen removability is reported for the first time to activate C&#8722;H and vector downstream reactions.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99&#8201;%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH's intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8722; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94&#8201;% yield. This in situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down&#8208;regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small&#8208;molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.







Abstract
With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8722;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8722;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8722;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A platinum-metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down-regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small-molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK-mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD-1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum-metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody-based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD-1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down-regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols via Amine Modified Copper Nanoparticles at Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products was significantly enhanced over Cu by the modification of n&#8208;butylamine at acidic media. The FE of C2+ products could reach up to 81.8&#8201;% with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the FE of C2+ alcohols was 52.6&#8201;%. The amine molecule on the surface of Cu could not only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which resulted in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8&#8201;% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6&#8201;%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60&#8201;%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized caged carbon catalysts enriched with pentagonal structures and investigated their catalytic activity for the high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction. The origin of the ORR activity of the pentagon&#8208;containing carbon catalyst lies in the spin that localizes in the pentagon ring. The SOMO of pentagon&#8208;containing molecules is characterized by &#960; orbitals and is energetically low, which promotes effective oxygen adsorption.







Abstract
The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of emissive N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Cu(I) amide complexes herald a significant advancement in the domain of linear two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) emitters, characterized by their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and dual emissive properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8211;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8211;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N-heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)-coordinated copper amide emitters (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet-triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi-Cu-diphenylamide (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a short &#964;&lt;sub&gt;TADF&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a k&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt; rate of 1.82&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen-sensing applications. Complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi-Cu-amides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isofunctional but Structurally Different Methyltransferases for Dithiolopyrrolone Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one job: DtpM and XrdM are two bacterial enzymes that have different structures but still catalyze the same reaction: the amide N&#8208;methylation of dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs). Ligand binding to both enzymes was studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, mutagenesis and activity assays. The results suggest that different organisms developed distinct methyltransferases for the same task by convergent evolution.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) natural products are produced by several different bacteria and have potent antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. While the amide of their DTP core can be methylated to fine&#8208;tune bioactivity, the enzyme responsible for the amide N&#8208;methylation has remained elusive in most taxa. Here, we identified the amide methyltransferase XrdM that is responsible for xenorhabdin (XRD) methylation in Xenorhabdus doucetiae but encoded outside of the XRD gene cluster. XrdM turned out to be isofunctional with the recently reported methyltransferase DtpM, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the DTP thiolutin, although its X&#8208;ray structure is unrelated to that of DtpM. To investigate the structural basis for ligand binding in both enzymes, we used X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic activity assays. Our study expands the limited knowledge of post&#8208;non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) amide methylation in DTP biosynthesis and reveals an example of convergent evolution of two structurally completely different enzymes for the same reaction in different organisms.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An interface chemistry modulation strategy is proposed to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. The strong interactions significantly promote internal electron exchanges, and the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2. This enhancement promotes a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*.







Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between &#8208;OH and &#8208;O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8722;CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkable durability (1000&#8197;hours at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and quick charge performances.

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc&#8208;iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.

&lt;p&gt;The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc-iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high-performance aqueous zinc-iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high-performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt; band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d-orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d-band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I-based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal-Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin-polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rewritable Surface&#8208;Grafted Polymer Brushes with Dynamic Covalent Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the fabrication of rewritable surface&#8208;initiated polymer brushes with a relatively high grafting density grafted from both nanoparticles and macroscopic surfaces has been developed. The incorporation of a dynamic covalent chemical linkage at the &#8220;root&#8221; of the polymer brushes would, in principle, enable unlimited rounds of degrafting and regrafting of polymer brushes.







Abstract
Surface grafting of polymer brushes drastically modifies surface properties, including wettability, compatibility, responsiveness, etc. A broad variety of functionalities can be introduced to the surface via different types of polymers. Bringing together properties of two or more types of polymer brushes to one surface opens up even more possibilities in brush&#8208;modified materials. However, while it is generally feasible to introduce several chemical compositions along the brushes via copolymerization, it is challenging to vary the types of polymer brushes along a surface. Although previous studies have demonstrated binary brushes via orthogonal polymerization techniques or partial deactivation/regrafting, they commonly limit the number of polymer types to two. Here, we propose a strategy to introduce dynamic covalent diketoenamine linkages at the root of polymer brushes. The grafting density could be precisely tuned during surface functionalization. The surface&#8208;anchored polymer brushes were cleaved by the addition of small molecule amines. New polymer brushes can be regrafted from the surface following refunctionalization of exposed sites. The maneuverability allows tuning of the types and densities of the polymer brushes, pointing the way to the preparation of a new generation of well&#8208;defined brush&#8208;modified materials with mixed grafts, with potential applications in the design of smart materials and surfaces.

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

A pulsed&#8208;bias technique was developed to dynamically stabilize oxygen atoms in silver (Ag) electrodes under operando conditions, allowing to achieve highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis.







Abstract
Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst's electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the exciting discovery of the surface modification of carbon dots drives the construction of an assembly asymmetric environment to realize a full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the aggregated state. Moreover, we explore panchromatic as well as white&#8208;light CPL applications of light emitting diodes and large flexible optical films, which provide new material strategies for virtual reality, medical imaging, and scientific visualization, among others.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has numerous applications in optical data storage, quantum computing, bioresponsive imaging, liquid crystal displays, and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. In addition to their competitive optical properties, carbon dots (CDs) benefit from simple and low&#8208;cost preparation, facile post&#8208;modification, and excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. In this study, hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participate in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on the ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core, are employed to drive the oriented assembly. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs form multiple hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form an asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfere with the optical dynamics of the exciton radiation transition and stabilize the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands overcome the frequent aggregation&#8208;induced quenching phenomenon that present difficulties in conventional CDs, facilitate the assembly of self&#8208;supporting films, and improve chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL are manipulated by simply adjusting the functional groups of the ligands, which also illustrates the versatility of the post&#8208;modification strategy. Finally, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable chiral powder phosphors were constructed, thereby providing feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.

         <dc:description>
The dual single atoms (SAs) catalyst Er3Nd1/CN is designed and synthesized by atomic confinement and coordination strategies, and exhibits record&#8208;level rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH in CO2 photoreduction. Synchrotron radiation, in&#8208;situ test, and density functional theory (DFT)calculations indicate that weaker *CO adsorption on the Nd tends to desorb and migrate to Er site for C&#8722;C coupling, which is the key to ethanol synthesis.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom&#8208;confinement and coordination method. The dual Er&#8722;Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, XAFS analysis, aberration&#8208;corrected HAADF&#8208;STEM, and in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and DFT calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4&#8201;f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge&#8208;transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare earth&#8208;based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

Through a combination of theoretical calculation, XAFS analysis, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM, and &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; FTIR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and DFT calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4&#8201;f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge-transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;OH (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1, 2) via a novel rare earth-based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non&#8208;natural glycopeptide antigen with a site&#8208;specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.







Abstract
Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non&#8208;natural amino acids and has an &#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM197 (Cross&#8208;Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re&#8208;bridging of a disulfide in CRM197, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1&#8208;like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site&#8208;specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2&#8201;% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic overall water splitting system is successfully developed using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of PMA2PbI4/MoS2 as the H2 evolution photocatalyst and theWO3/RuOx as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA=C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Pulsed EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride sensing riboswitch was investigated by EPR&#8208;based distance measurements. Electron&#8208;electron double resonance revealed preorganisation of the stem structures and conformational flexibility while electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance demonstrates low structural heterogeneity around the fluoride site and distinct differences between the crystal and solution structures.







Abstract
Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8722; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F&#8197;ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF&#8208;8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF&#8208;8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane. Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.

     alt="Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline-Decorated ZIF-8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF-8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF-8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF-8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF-8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF-8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2-methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF-8 (Ani&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-ZIF-8) membrane was prepared using a fast current-driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF-8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane.

         <title>Metallic Impurities in Electrolysis: Catalytic Effect of Pb Traces in Reductive Amination and Acetone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the reductive amination of acetone with methylamine as nitrogen source using electrochemistry revealed the catalytic activity of 1&#8197;ppm Pb. In addition, the effects of the applied potential and the cathode materials on the reaction were investigated. Finally, the results were transferred to the electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone.







Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the active species in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1&#8197;ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling Enables an Ultra&#8208;Fast Wittig Olefination Under Ambient and Solvent&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a protocol for a solvent&#8208;free mechanically induced Wittig olefination under ambient conditions often without the need of ylide pre&#8208;formation with a 30&#8197;seconds reaction time under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions.







Abstract
30&#8197;Seconds to success!&#8212;The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion. A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Exploring Aqueous Solution&#8208;Processed Pseudohalide Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;temperature hybrid pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskite (HPREDP) ferroelectric was obtained by rationally designed. Further, we explored application of HPREDP ferroelectric in X&#8208;ray detection, and achieved the highest sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (among all hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors).







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics. Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285&#8197;K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344&#8197;K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) was constructed by using the assembled ZnS@SiO2 nanoparticles as a photonic crystal template and in situ polymerizing oligo ethylene glycol acrylate. Owing to the cosolvency&#8208;induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side&#8208;chains in ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.

Owing to the cosolvency-induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side-chains in ethanol-water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol-rich concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush-like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush-like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side-chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol-water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol-rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real-time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual&#8208;Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual&#8208;atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. The dual&#8208;atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs RHE.







Abstract
Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable&#8208;type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual&#8208;atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C2N cavity as anchoring &#8220;pincers&#8221; to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu2&#8208;C2N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO2RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8722;C coupling and guarantees FEC2+ (90.8&#8201;%) and FEC2H4. (71.7&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.10&#8197;V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu2 site would be subtly flipped during CO2RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization. We validate that atomic printing strategies are applicable to wide range of metal combinations, representing a significant advancement in the development of IMSCs.

         <title>Quantifying the Hydration&#8208;Dependent Dynamics of Cu Migration and Activity in Zeolite Omega for the Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega's (Cu&#8208;omega) activity in partial methane oxidation via oxygen looping significantly varies with the conditions applied. Using primarily in situ anomalous x&#8208;ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) the source of this divergent behavior is revealed to be due to a migration of Cu throughout the framework, which in turn is predominantly controlled by the system's degree of hydration.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega) is a potent material for the selective conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) via the oxygen looping approach. However, its performance exhibits substantial variation depending on the operational conditions. Under an isothermal temperature regime, Cu&#8208;omega demonstrates subdued activity below 230&#8201;&#176;C, but experiences a remarkable increase in activity at 290&#8201;&#176;C. Applying a high&#8208;temperature activation protocol at 450&#8201;&#176;C causes a rapid deactivation of the material. This behavioral divergence is investigated by combining reactivity studies, neutron diffraction and in situ high&#8208;resolution anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (HR&#8208;AXRPD), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, to reveal that the migration of Cu throughout the framework is the primary cause of these behaviors, which in turn is predominantly governed by the degree of hydration of the system. This work suggests that control over the Cu migration throughout the zeolite framework may be harnessed to significantly increase the activity of Cu&#8208;omega by generating more active sites for the MtM conversion. These results underscore the power of in situ HR&#8208;AXRPD for unraveling the behavior of materials under reaction conditions and suggest that a re&#8208;evaluation of Cu&#8208;zeolites priorly deemed inactive for the MtM conversion across a broader range of conditions and looping protocols may be warranted.

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Measuring Kinetics under Vibrational Strong Coupling: Testing for a Change in the Nucleophilicity of Water and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) is reported to modify chemical reactivity, but its mode of action is not understood. Here, we provide a methodology using fixed&#8208;width optical cavities for measuring kinetics under VSC in a reproducible way. The large kinetic dataset showed that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of alcohols.







Abstract
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to change the rate of organic reactions. However, a lack of convenient and reliable methods to measure reaction kinetics under VSC makes it challenging to obtain mechanistic insight into its influence, hindering progress in the field. Here, we use recently developed fixed&#8208;width optical cavities to obtain large kinetic datasets under VSC with small errors (&#177;1&#8211;5&#8201;%) in an operationally simple manner using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The setup is used to test whether VSC changes a fundamental kinetic property of polar reactions, nucleophilicity, for water and alcohols, species commonly used in VSC&#8208;modified chemistry. We determined the rate constants for nucleophilic capture with a library of benzhydrilium ions as reference electrophiles with and without strong coupling of the nucleophile's key vibrations. For all investigated combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles, only minor changes in the observed rate constants of the reactions were observed independently of the coupled bands. These results indicate that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of water and alcohols, suggesting that polar reactions are modified through other, presently unknown mechanisms. Fixed&#8208;width cavities allow for convenient and reproducible UV/Vis kinetics, facilitating mechanistic studies of VSC&#8208;modified chemistry.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A man with a fishing rod&lt;/b&gt; to accurately pinpoint the target water molecule hidden among many ethanol molecules is illustrated in the cover picture. The fishing rod is shaped like the brush-like polymer structure used in the Research Article by Xiaoxia Le, Tao Chen et&#8197;al. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202414136"&gt;(e202414136)&lt;/a&gt;. The rod body is composed of the acrylate backbones and the fishing line consists of the polyethylene glycol sidechains. The mountains in the background reflect the photonic crystal structure with different response degrees and corresponding structural colors.

Tryptophan nitration chemistry of an economically impactful heme enzyme, TxtE, has been modeled utilizing synthetic heme mimics by Sam&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser, Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409430). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular flasks are hollow supramolecular structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions, often exhibiting complex catalytic mechanisms and selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. This Review discusses the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, and showcases the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through their use, focusing on examples relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe this summary will facilitate the design and development of novel catalysis examples inside molecular flasks







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks&#8211;supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the first report of covalent organic frameworks as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2014, a new type of &#8220;soft photocatalyst&#8221; was released. Here, a historical overview as well as the current state of the art and future perspectives on various photocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction (ORR), and alcohol oxidation, are given.







Abstract
Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, the replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest, both societally and scientifically. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction was reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; based on porous polymers in general. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field since its inception in 2014. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction, and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learned for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field of &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; are given.

         <title>Disorder Over Pore Size: Boosting Supercapacitor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Forse and co&#8208;workers show that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. This discovery provides a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors, guiding the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials.







Abstract
The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials. These materials require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. In a recent publication, Forse and co&#8208;workers reveal that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly linked and fused dimers were synthesized for aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex and antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base. The fused dimers show larger electronic interactions but the respective antiaromatic and aromatic characters are well preserved.







Abstract
Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Doping in Robust Open&#8208;Shell Ladder&#8208;Type Oligoaniline Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;doping mechanism is introduced in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. This mechanism, facilitated by resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer, enables efficient self&#8208;doping of the organic electronic compound, resulting in a durable conductive material without the need for an external dopant. The findings open new possibilities for creating organic conductors that are both high&#8208;performing and long&#8208;lasting.







Abstract
A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer and electronic doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material&#8216;s electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>

Polymers with covalently incorporated donor&#8208;acceptor torsional springs allow for real&#8208;time monitoring of forces, that are calibrated using known spiropyran mechanophores. This concept is demonstrated using glassy, entangled polymers and elastomeric networks.







Abstract
Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes. The agreement between both approaches underlines that these DA springs provide the unique opportunity for the online monitoring of local molecular forces present in diverse polymer matrices.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Hyponitrite Reactivity: The Fe&#8208;hyponitrite complex 3 was generated from preformed hyponitrite and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Upon protonation or oxidation, quantitative N2O formation occurs. Lewis acidity of iron plays a key role in reactivity, as a more Lewis acidic iron center leads to the cleavage of the N=N bond of hyponitrite.







Abstract
Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite many efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.

Li[HC2O5] is the first hydrogen&#8208;containing pyrocarbonate. It was synthesized by a reaction of CO2 and H2O with Li2[CO3] at moderate pressures and temperatures together with an anhydrous lithium pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) in a DAC. The crystal structure was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations. The structure refinement and DFT calculations show that in Li[HC2O5] a symmetric hydrogen bond is present in the hydrogenated pyrocarbonate anion [HC2O5]&#8722;.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis Inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly&#8208;specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain&#8208;of&#8208;functions. Importantly, Cu&#8208;MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper&#8208;poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu&#8208;MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)&#8208;rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu&#8208;MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates.

&lt;p&gt;The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly-specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain-of-functions. Importantly, Cu-MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper-poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu-MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)-rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu-MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)-responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc-bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Quality Photoswitchable Probe that Selectively and Potently Regulates the Transcription Factor ROR&#947;</title>

Azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inverse agonists of the retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) enable optical control of gene expression mediated by this important nuclear hormone receptor, with excellent potency and selectivity.







Abstract
Retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions in circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and immunity. Its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms, and cell&#8208;specific activity in the immune system, make it an intriguing target for spatially and temporally localised pharmacology. To create tools that can study ROR&#947; biology with appropriate spatiotemporal resolution, we designed light&#8208;dependent inverse ROR&#947; agonists by building azobenzene photoswitches into ligand consensus structures. Optimizations gave photoswitchable ROR&#947; inhibitors combining a large degree of potency photocontrol, with remarkable on&#8208;target potency, and excellent selectivity over related off&#8208;target receptors. This still rare combination of performance features distinguishes them as high quality photopharmaceutical probes, which can now serve as high precision tools to study the spatial and dynamic intricacies of ROR&#947; action in signaling and in inflammatory disorders.

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation for Amine Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene Enables Direct Access to Responsive Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel method for producing functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) via a 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE). Our approach addresses current synthetic challenges by enabling the efficient incorporation of amine functionalities into crystalline PEs in the melt phase. These functional materials have diverse potential applications and here we show that aminated PEs exhibit enhanced material properties, and pH responsive properties results in antibacterial PE films.







Abstract
While functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) exhibit valuable characteristics, the constraints of existing synthetic approaches limit the variety of readily incorporated functionality. New methods to generate functionalized PEs are required to afford new applications of this common material. We report 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE) as a method to produce amine&#8208;terminated PE. VTPEs with molecular weights between 2200&#8211;16800&#8197;g/mol are successfully aminated using solvent&#8208;free conditions. Our catalytic system is efficient for the installation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines, and can be carried out on multigram scale. The associating amine functional groups afford modified material properties, as measured by water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polymer rheology. The basic amine functionality offers the opportunity to convert inert PE into stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such that the protonation of aminated PE affords the generation of functional antibacterial PE films.

         <title>Dynamic Asymmetric Diamination of Allylic Alcohols through Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis: Diastereo&#8208;Divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzodiazepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein an unprecedented, catalytic enantioconvergent diamination of racemic allylic alcohols with the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. This iridium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalytic system operates through an atom&#8208;economical borrowing hydrogen amination/aza&#8208;Michael cascade, and converts readily available phenylenediamines and racemic allylic alcohols to 1,5&#8208;tetrahydrobenzodiazepines in high enantioselectivity. An intriguing solvent&#8208;dependent switch of diastereoselectivity was also observed.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

The metathesis&#8208;active W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2 (C6H10=cyclohexylidene) complexes are available in three steps (tungsten oxides&#8594;W(NR)2Cl2&#8594;W(NR)2Cy2&#8594;W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2) without making alkylidene intermediates and without using strong acids. The bisnonafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;butoxide alkylidene complexes can be converted readily into bisalkoxide, bispyrrolide, and MAP complexes through nucleophilic substitutions. Cyclohexylidene complexes appear to be more readily prepared than neophylidene complexes, perhaps in part because any cyclohexene complex formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is isomerized to a cyclohexylidene complex by RF9OH. This mild acid&#8208;catalyzed approach is an attractive alternative to established syntheses of tungsten neopentylidene or neophylidene imido complexes.







Abstract
The fluorinated alcohols, (CF3)3COH (RF9OH) and (CF3)2MeCOH (RF6OH), react with W(NR)2Cy2 (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or 1&#8208;adamantyl) in C6D6 at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The ORF9 ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me2Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)2Cy2, W(NAr)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAr)(ORF6)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAd)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(AdNH2), W(NAr)(O&#8208;i&#8208;PrF6)3Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;1&#8208;Me2Pyr)2(C6H10) (C6H10=cyclohexylidene).

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is an interesting tool in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology due to its selective and versatile reactivity. We show that chemically stable diazo peptides, which even tolerate 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid, can be generated and used as high&#8208;precision chemical tools.







Abstract
Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH&#8197;1&#8211;14 as amides and from pH&#8197;1&#8211;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMPA receptors are central to excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain but difficult to control with sufficient precision. We developed MP&#8208;GluAblock, a cell specific light&#8208;controllable AMPAR blocker that consists of a photo&#8208;switchable compound (P) that is targeted to specific cells via an expressed membrane&#8208;anchor protein (M). Our approach could be used to dissect AMPAR signaling with unprecedented cellular and spatiotemporal specificity.







Abstract
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision. Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>

The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for direct urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites with electrochemical reduction tolerance by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. The vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species was disclosed.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.

Remarkable properties have been predicted for cubic graphite, a hypothetical 3D carbon allotrope composed of carbon cages (C48). A sixty carbons fragment of cubic graphite, benzofused (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208;tris(tribenzo[8]annulene) (TTBA), was now assembled by K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization of tribenzoCOTyne, that contains 36&#8197;carbon atoms properly arranged in a well&#8208;defined cubic graphite cage (C48).







Abstract
A remarkable stereodivergent cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (tribenzoCOTyne) to the corresponding (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;benzofused derivatives has been developed by controlling the reaction conditions. While the K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization afforded the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer, using Pd as a catalyst resulted in the (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;derivative. Both stereoisomers were evidenced by spectroscopic data and crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis. The (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer is a fragment of cubic graphite (CG), an elusive 3D carbon allotrope that contains carbon cages, since all of its sixty carbons are part of the structure of CG, and 36&#8197;constitute a part of the C48 molecular cage of CG. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the potassium ion would play a key role as a template to favor the formation of the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer.
