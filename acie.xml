         <title>Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCN) to enhance the performance of chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using a temperature sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system was 7.1 times of those without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high&#8208;quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non&#8208;radical pathway to a radical&#8208;based pathway in the presence of the confinement. This work provides an interesting strategy to produce locally high temperature which has a wide range of applications to energy and environmental fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrogen&#8208;doped CP&#8208;PAH, dibenzodiazapyracylene, was successfully synthesized and characterized. The aromatic and antiaromatic resonance hybrid characters have been verified by comparing their 1H&#8197;NMR spectra to those of reference molecules. Their condensed packing structures in the solid state allowed for the effective hole transporting.







Abstract
Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8722;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High host&#8208;dopant miscibility and excellent carrier mobility can be simultaneously achieved in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. High&#8208;mobility polymers usually possess poor miscibility because of strong interchain interactions. Without harming the efficient charge&#8208;transport based on the ordered polymer backbones packing, disordered side&#8208;chains are introduced to accommodate dopants better without disturbing charge&#8208;transport pathways.







Abstract
Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We have developed a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8208;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach to generate the largest aluminum molecular rings is presented. Their nonlinear optics (NLO) and optical limiting (OL) performance is studied by the Z&#8208;scan technique. The results provide insights to understand the NLO structure&#8211;activity relationship and tune the NLO performance at a molecular level.







Abstract
Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2&#215;9 and 3&#215;6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0&#8197;nm to 1.7&#8197;nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics.

         <title>A Universal Single&#8208;Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the tannic acid coating method, a series of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic single&#8208;atom coatings (SACs) (e.&#8201;g., Co, Fe, Mn, Co&#8722;Mn, Fe&#8722;Mn) can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon cloth, SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm).







Abstract
Here, we report a universal single&#8208;atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of the rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.&#8201;g., carbon, SiO2, TiO2, MoS2), dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) and sizes (50&#8197;nm&#8211;5&#8197;cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8211;dopamine complexes or metal&#8211;organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on graphene and TiO2 were prepared. The former one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single&#8208;atom coating&#8211;TiO2 heterojunction.

The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owing to the high activity of the single atoms and the formation of the single-atom coating&#8211;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel flexible soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes were developed on commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrates. The quasi&#8208;vertically oriented, solid Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 particles grown on the PVDF substrate provided predominant molecular sieving gas entrances, while the soft polyamide eliminated defects enclosing MOF particles, resulting in a superior H2/CO2 separation factor which far exceeded those of MOF&#8208;based membranes reported to date.







Abstract
The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn2(Bim)4 (Bim=benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn2(Bim)4 acted as predominant pathways, while the polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H2/CO2 selectivity of 1084 which set a new record for MOF&#8208;based membranes. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3&#8197;mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H2/CO2 separation accuracies. These results, which demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs, will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

Multifunctional microrobots, made of Ni@Pt microrockets, CdS quantum dots, and a host &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin selector, have been engineered that simultaneously exhibit i) self&#8208;propulsion, ii)&#8197;fluorescence, and iii)&#8197;magnetic properties in combination with iv) supramolecular chiral recognition for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; approaches. As a model chiral target, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated using a bimodal (optical and electrical) readout.







Abstract
Herein, a general procedure for the synthesis of multifunctional MRs, which simultaneously exhibit i) chiral, ii)&#8197;magnetic, and iii)&#8197;fluorescent properties in combination with iv) self&#8208;propulsion, is reported. Self&#8208;propelled Ni@Pt superparamagnetic microrockets have been functionalized with fluorescent CdS quantum dots carrying a chiral host biomolecule as &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; chiral recognition potential of MRs has been interrogated by taking advantage of the &#946;&#8208;CD affinity to supramolecularly accommodate different chiral biomolecules (i.e., amino acids). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated with a dual&#8208;mode (optical and electrochemical) readout. This approach paves the way to devise intelligent cargo micromachines with &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral supramolecular recognition capabilities to elucidate the concept of &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221;, which might be facilely customized by tailoring the supramolecular host&#8211;guest encapsulation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8&#8201;% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using asymmetric peripheral protection as a design motif, two high efficiency and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials were designed and synthesized. The corresponding device exhibits pure green emission with a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 32.8&#8201;% and relatively low efficiency roll&#8208;off without utilizing any sensitizer.







Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve a high PLQY of 96&#8201;% and a fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green devices with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.8&#8201;% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains a high EQE exceeding 23&#8201;% at a high luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A descriptor &#916;E was developed based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism, allowing accurate predictions of organic host&#8211;guest phosphorescent systems.







Abstract
Although doping can induce room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;E to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing via higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with a high accuracy of 83&#8201;%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67&#8197;s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;E descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After two decades since its discovery, the structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 has been determined as a novel framework comprised of a primitive orthorhombic crystal system with monoclinic faulting that forms unique, 1D 12&#8208;ring sinusoidal channels. A combination of molecular modeling and empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity was used to design two new di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and produce SSZ&#8208;43 across a wide range of high SiO2 compositions.







Abstract
The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5&#215;8.9&#8197;&#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: &#8776;90&#8201;% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and &#8776;10&#8201;% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the easy manipulation of peptoid&#8211;peptoid and peptoid&#8211;particle interactions solely by the variation of side chain chemistry, peptoid&#8208;induced formation of five&#8208;fold twinned Au star&#8208;shaped particles exhibiting five regular points has been achieved through a process of repeated particle attachment followed by facet stabilization.







Abstract
While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8211;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8211;Au interactions, leading to the synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars via a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization. Ex situ and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.

         <dc:description>
A regioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed triborylation of unactivated alkenes is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes with a catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and xantphos. Mechanistic studies reveal that this triborylation reaction proceeds through three interdependent catalytic cycles.







Abstract
The structural diversity of sp3&#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp3 1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold can be dissolved in a sustainable manner with common household chemicals: iodine solution in ethanol, resembling diluted iodine tincture, green oxidant hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, a compound used in medicinal applications. Catalytic reactions and green solvents are the basis for sustainable development and recycling of precious metals like gold.







Abstract
Gold is a scarce element in the Earth's crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I2 oxidizes Au0 and forms a [AuII2]&#8722; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand AuI complex. H2O2 oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I2 returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.

Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2-mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidizes Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and forms a [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species, which undergoes subsequent ligand-exchange reactions and forms a stable bis-ligand Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open a new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with the utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Variable Oxygen Affinity for Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;support interaction between Pt and CoOx creates a strong built&#8208;in electric field across the interface and modulates the charge distribution. This electric field subtly optimizes both the hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy, boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media.







Abstract
Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoOx electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;enabled controlled copolymerization compatible with both batch and flow syntheses has been established for the transformation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides. This work enables on&#8208;demand preparation of main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with various fractions of alternating units under ambient conditions, and streamlines the generation of block copolymers from gaseous fluoroethylene using two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow systems.







Abstract
Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes.







Abstract
Probes featuring room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges around the microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. Herein, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with a RTP emission lasting for &#8776;5&#8197;s and a lifetime as long as 743.7&#8197;ms. We demonstrate that live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of &#8776;69 for in vitro imaging, and &#8776;627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8197;times.

         <title>Selective Fluorescence Imaging of Cancer Cells Based on ROS&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Cross&#8208;Linking of Artificial Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.







Abstract
Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.

&lt;p&gt;When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size-exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well-defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;-benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed-monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix-induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red multi&#8208;resonance emitters with high photoluminescence quantum yields and narrowband emission were demonstrated by introducing homogeneous hexatomic rings into nitrogen&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting devices afforded state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with external quantum efficiency up to 18.2&#8201;% and superior operation stability.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the remaining parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit near unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peaks at 598&#8197;nm and 620&#8197;nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximums of 28&#8197;nm and 31&#8197;nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2&#8201;%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 after 94&#8197;hours.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical quantitative measurements of vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level reveal a sex difference in transmitter release during exocytosis, which might relate to the sex difference of the expression level of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. This research provides a new perspective to understand sex dimorphism in exocytosis.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at the single&#8208;vesicle level are essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in the male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in the female group release part of the neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in exocytosis.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High-resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor-specific therapy with negligible long-term toxicity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Membrane Based on Pillararene&#8208;Intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a series of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid nanosheets based on pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene nanosheets is reported, which have larger lateral size compared with the original MXene nanosheets, in which a membrane was formed through vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration. The as&#8208;prepared membranes exhibited relatively high water permeance, rejection, and stability for treating water containing antibiotics under dead&#8208;end filtration and cross&#8208;flow filtration conditions.







Abstract
Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and threatens biological and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required. We prepared inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXene&#8211;pillararene nanosheets with a large lateral size (5&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36&#8197;nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>

Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

Abstract
Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage applications. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5&#8197;m concentrated electrolyte with a calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)2) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion of Ca2+ in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific discharge capacity at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 84.7&#8201;% capacity retention over 350&#8197;cycles, among the best results known for CIBs.

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru Superstructure for Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets with a superlattice is reported and the significance of the superlattice on electrocatalysis is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, which leads to the lattice contraction and the weakening of the *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance.







Abstract
Superlattices are attracting extensive attention due to their unique properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattices are limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of the superlattice in metal&#8208;based nanostructures on catalysis is unexplored yet. We here report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with a superlattice. Characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking Ru layers with twisted angles from 2&#176; to 30&#176;.

     alt="Superlattice in a Ru Superstructure for Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile wet-chemical method for synthesizing two-dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets with a superlattice is reported and the significance of the superlattice on electrocatalysis is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, which leads to the lattice contraction and the weakening of the *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superlattices are attracting extensive attention due to their unique properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattices are limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of the superlattice in metal-based nanostructures on catalysis is unexplored yet. We here report a facile wet-chemical method for synthesizing two-dimensional Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with a superlattice. Characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking Ru layers with twisted angles from 2&#176; to 30&#176;. Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs can serve as an efficient catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations reveal that the superlattice can induce the strain effect, which leads to lattice contraction and weak *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work sheds new light on the utilization of the superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;Assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons, deposited by electrospray controlled ion beam deposition, form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers after multiple chemical transformations employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols. These transformations and the nature of the metal&#8211;organic coordination motifs are investigated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy.







Abstract
The chemical processing of low&#8208;dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real&#8208;space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9&#8197;nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8211;organic coordination polymers.

         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore was tailored as a PAI&#8208;active macrocyclization scaffold for controlling macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly, which enabled the development of a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PET/PAI bimodal probe [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 for noninvasive imaging of drug&#8208;induced tumor apoptosis in vivo, with potential for the early monitoring of tumor response to chemotherapy.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe ([18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA, [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1 can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful for optimizing the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylcyanation of Ynamides: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;Silyl&#8208;2&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles (&#945;&#8208;enaminonitriles) are underinvestigated building blocks due to the lack of methodologies to synthesize them in a controlled manner. A general access to these valuable scaffolds accompanied by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations is described. This highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective strategy relies on the use of the first intermolecular silylcyanation of ynamides.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.

Through plasma&#8208;enabled post&#8208;treatment technology, a constant elastic collision with a large surface area generates periodic lattice vibration at a high potential difference, thereby rearranging the lattice along the electrically preferred direction. Nanocrystallinity of the semiconductor film is dramatically improved through the rearrangement of lattice, and thus the optoelectric properties of the materials are greatly enhanced.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films show better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.

         <title>Carboxyl Methyltransferase Catalysed Formation of Mono&#8208; and Dimethyl Esters under Aqueous Conditions: Application in Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carboxyl methyltransferase FtpM can catalyse methylation and dimethylation of a wide range of mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids, showing high regioselectivity for some diacids. The enzymatic methylation works under aqueous conditions and can therefore be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated by the two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot conversion of bioderived HMF to bioplastics precursor FDME.







Abstract
Carboxyl methyltransferase (CMT) enzymes catalyse the biomethylation of carboxylic acids under aqueous conditions and have potential for use in synthetic enzyme cascades. Herein we report that the enzyme FtpM from Aspergillus fumigatus can methylate a broad range of aromatic mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids in good to excellent conversions. The enzyme shows high regioselectivity on its natural substrate fumaryl&#8208;l&#8208;tyrosine, trans, trans&#8208;muconic acid and a number of the dicarboxylic acids tested. Dicarboxylic acids are generally better substrates than monocarboxylic acids, although some substituents are able to compensate for the absence of a second acid group. For dicarboxylic acids, the second methylation shows strong pH dependency with an optimum at pH&#8197;5.5&#8211;6. Potential for application in industrial biotechnology was demonstrated in a cascade for the production of a bioplastics precursor (FDME) from bioderived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water Purification and Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An umbrella&#8208;like donor&#8208;acceptor system (GDPA&#8208;QCN) based on a bulky dendritic donor (umbrella head) and a liner heterocyclic acceptor (umbrella handle) has been developed. GDPA&#8208;QCN shows strong sunlight absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal conversion properties in the solid state and was employed to fabricate a high&#8208;performance water purification and electricity generation system.







Abstract
In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100&#8197;nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8211;Polymer Amphiphiles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomeric di&#8208;block peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) provide a modular platform for sophisticated higher&#8208;order assembly, but tools to predict assembly behavior from molecular structure are limited. By systematically characterizing PPAs composed of oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random coil peptides, we outline general design principles of PPAs showing how oligomer length, dispersity, and peptide hydrophilicity impact the morphological distribution.







Abstract
Peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8211;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

         <dc:description>
Unravelling the mechanism &#160;of charge accumulation and utilization in the light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction using iron porphyrins bearing hydrogen bonding scaffolds revealed unprecedented puzzle pieces about its rate limiting step. While the formal Fe(0) redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (e202117530) that the Fe(I) species is already involved in the substrate activation of the photocatalytic cycle.

         <dc:description>
Solution polymer mechanochemistry is well understood in random coil morphology. In their Research Article (e202115325), Charles&#8197;E. Diesendruck and Hang Zhang assess covalent mechanochemistry when &#945;&#8208;helices are present in covalent macromolecules. Poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamate)s (PBG) with different helicities are prepared by tuning the enantiomeric excess of the feed monomer. Ultrasonication is used to induce solvodynamic shear, leading to the scission of the polymer into smaller helices.

Gold is a valuable metal that can be dissolved with common household chemicals as reported by Timo Repo&#160;et&#8197;al.&#160;in their Research Article (e202117587). By applying catalytic iodine, aqueous hydrogen peroxide and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, gold promptly dissolves in ethanol. Catalytic reactions and environmentally benign solvents and reagents are the basis for sustainable development and a gateway to a greener future of precious metals recycling.

Self&#8208;propulsion multifunctional microrobots harboring chiral supramolecular selectors represent a promising pathway for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; while employing different readouts (e.g., optical and electrical). The combination of different active compounds in a single architecture allows for a multifunctional microrobot that simultaneously exhibits chiral recognition, but also fluorescent properties and the ability to be magnetically navigable and propelled in the presence of a chemical fuel, as described by Martin Pumera and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202116090).

         <title>Inter&#8208;relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium&#8208;based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter&#8208;relationship. This Minireview gathers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.







Abstract
The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers currently remains uncertain, as they rely on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on future directions of investigation is also given.

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic fluorophores in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) range have been validated as attractive imaging tools in biomedical research owing to their biocompatibility, flexible chemical structure, and tunable spectra. This Review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemistry, design principles, and optical properties of NIR&#8208;II organic contrast agents.







Abstract
Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, is a non&#8208;invasive imaging approach with high spatial and temporal resolution and high sensitivity, compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits of imaging using the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers have devoted great effort to developing contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this Review, we summarize recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduce engineering strategies and describe the imaging performance classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidate the challenges and prospects of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship is of crucial importance to the evaluation and the rational design of novel catalysts. Herein, single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is employed for super&#8208;resolution mapping of the chemical activity and kinetic analysis of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;based reactions on single gold plates, which enables spatiotemporal characterizations down to the single&#8208;reaction level.







Abstract
Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus in high demand. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)32+ based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry, that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37&#8197;nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8211;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may lead to gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally high performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photocatalytic reduction displayed by an iron&#8211;porphyrin bearing urea groups in the second coordination sphere is the result of the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst prior to the occurrence of the second electron uptake in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (UrFe) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO2 substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. While the Fe0 redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the FeI species is already involved in the CO2 activation, which represents the rate&#8208;determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO2 upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Origin of High Diastereoselectivity in Reactions of Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselective reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates have been systematically investigated. Diastereoselectivity was found to be general for &#1013;&#8208;lactams, &#1013;&#8208;lactones, and cycloheptanones with various substituent patterns. Computational investigations provided insight into the origin of the diastereoselectivity. A model for predicting the stereochemistry of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolate alkylations is proposed.







Abstract
Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are distinguished by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

         <title>Reversible One&#8208; to Two&#8208; to Three&#8208;Dimensional Transformation in CuII Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible multi&#8208;dimensional transformation of a coordination polymer composed of CuII ions and terephthalate ligands was achieved for the first time by controlling the coordination environment. The dimensional transformation led to significant changes in the chemical and physical properties specific to coordination polymers, such as gas sorption and magnetism.







Abstract
A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising CuII ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC2&#8722;). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cu&#8208;paddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of CuII in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on CuII&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function Cobalt Catalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles is reported, which employs an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. The method is characterized by its excellent functional group tolerance, substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes, and scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) with a low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv).







Abstract
The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8722;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8211;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200&#8197;mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05&#8197;equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.

         <title>Photoswitchable Molecular Communication between Programmable DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable bi&#8208;directional trafficking of biomolecules between programmable DNA&#8208;based artificial membraneless organelles in a cell&#8208;like microcompartment has been achieved to imitate intracellular communication towards construction of advanced functional artificial cells.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. Mimicking controlled bi&#8208;directional molecular communication inside artificial cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle&#8208;like DNA coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to fabricate membraneless non&#8208;fusing DNA coacervates by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo&#8208;regulated uni&#8208; and bi&#8208;directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with functional networks.

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;emissive amorphous AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer undergoes two successive crystallisation phase changes on mild solid&#8208;state heating. The first high symmetric crystalline phase becomes slightly red&#8208;emissive and the second, which has a lower symmetry, exhibits intense luminescence due to the presence of aurophilic interactions. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding, offering potential for non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
The discovery of a universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fuelled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for phase&#8208;change random access memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the AuI&#8211;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions and at the same time to display distinct optical signals, can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of dialdehydes led to structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes in good yields, with high enantioselectivity enabled by unprecedented NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes followed by kinetic resolution. This protocol, which features mild reaction conditions and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance, provides modular access to value&#8208;added axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.







Abstract
Axially chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.

Full stereochemical assignment of the structurally unique nucleoside antibiotic A&#8208;94964, which shows potent inhibitory activity against the vital bacterial phospho&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramyl&#8208;pentapeptide translocase, was achieved by the collective total synthesis of eight diastereoisomers in combination with NMR analysis.







Abstract
A collective total synthesis of eight diastereoisomers associated with NMR analysis leads to a full stereochemistry assignment of the structurally unique nucleoside antibiotic A&#8208;94964, which features an octuronic acid uridine core decorated with an &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannopyranosyl residue and an &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;N&#8208;acylglucosaminopyranosyl residue via a phosphodiester bridge.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum mechanical investigations of hydrocarbon macrocycle ensembles in solution by comparison of experimental and computed 13C&#8208;NMR spectra are described. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory allows the deduction of contributing molecular conformations.







Abstract
NMR as a routine analytical method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released CRENSO computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of 13C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cycloalkanes up to C20H40. We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables one to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocycles under ambient conditions from our automated procedure.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to obtain macroscopic hollow structures was developed involving a self&#8208;evolution process from dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermosets (PTUs) polymer films to neat hollow objects via immersion of aqueous NaOH solutions.







Abstract
Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structures are attracting increasing interest for the construction of various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow materials tend to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in an aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24&#8201;% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport behavior of two amine Cu porphyrin supramolecules with different stacking interactions in perovskite grain boundaries was investigated in detail. Results prove that the construction of homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in aromatic passivators is a key factor for the charge transport between perovskite grains. This work also affords a new strategy to design new optoelectronic materials with improved charge mobilities.







Abstract
Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have attracted considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus enabling the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules that probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in the perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the presence of a stronger interaction between the amine units and the central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules. This has a modified effect on the dipole direction of the porphyrins to be quantized as homogeneously large polarons (HLPs) in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance to as high as 24.2&#8201;%. This work proves that the modulation of the intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism Processes in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of solid&#8208;state MAS NMR on live microalgae for monitoring of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamics changes is demonstrated. Conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids is observed, accompanied with rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. It is concluded that high cell densities, creating dark, anoxia conditions, induce lipid catabolism and cell death resulting in breakdown of cell and organelle membranes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 14, March 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lightweight, mechanically reinforced, hygroresponsive organic crystalline hybrid materials has been synthesized by a universally applicable approach. The crystals are robust, durable, and moisture&#8208;absorbing, and show a highly linear deformation over a wide range of relative humidity. Such precise spatiotemporal control over the light output in response to air humidity allows the materials to be used as optical waveguides.







Abstract
Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.

         <dc:description>As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds.&#160; Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the g position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;C  carbenium  interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pd&#8211;H/Isothiourea Cooperative Catalysis Approach to anti&#8208;Aldol Motifs:&#160;Enantioselective a&#8208;Alkylation of Prochiral Esters with Oxyallenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of beta&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs,, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99%  ee  ). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value  vicinal  stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Strategies for Analyte Detection using DNA&#8208;Based Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based nanostructures as probes have led to significant advances in chemical and biological sensing, allowing for the detection of analytes in complex media, the understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the ability to diagnose diseases based on molecular signatures. The utility of these structures arises both from DNA&#8217;s inherent ability to selectively recognize and bind a variety of chemical species and from the unique properties observed when DNA is restructured at the nanoscale. In this Minireview, we chronicle the most commonly used signal transduction strategies that have been interfaced with various DNA&#8208;based nanostructures. We discuss the types of analytes and the detection scenarios that are sought after, delineate the advantages and disadvantages of each signaling strategy, and outline the key considerations that guide the selection of each signaling method.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligomeric Acceptor: A &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy to Bridge Small Molecules and Polymers for Stable Solar Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomeric acceptors are expected to combine the advantages of both highly developed small molecular and polymeric acceptors. However, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on oligomers lag far behind due to their slow development and low diversity. Here, three oligomeric acceptors were produced through oligomerization of small molecules. The dimer dBTIC&#947;&#8208;EH achieved the best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.48% in bulk heterojunction devices and possess T80 (80% of the initial PCE) lifetime of&#160;1020 h under illumination, which are far better than that of small molecular and polymeric acceptors. More excitingly, it showed PCEs of 16.06% in quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (Q&#8208;PHJ) devices which is the highest value OSCs using oligomeric acceptors to date. These results suggest that oligomerization of small molecules is a promising strategy to achieve OSCs with optimized performance between the high efficiency and durable stability, and give oligomeric materials a shining future in the commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1%, 95.1%, and 95.3%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization that competes with substrate assembly is an important aspect of anti&#8208;aggregation chaperones that remains poorly understood. Using the J domain chaperone DNAJB6, how the Parkinson's related T193A mutation affects chaperone oligomerization has been explored. The C&#8208;terminal domain of DNAJB6b exhibits significant microsecond dynamics that are enhanced in the T193A mutant, leading to a monomeric partially&#8208;folded state.







Abstract
DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of &#8776;100&#8197;&#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics, oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.

         <title>A New Platform of B/N&#8208;Doped Cyclophanes: Access to a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Block&#8208;Type B3N3 Macrocycle with Strong Dipole Moment and Unique Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual block&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 that shows a strong dipole moment and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is introduced. Compared with other cyclic hexamers, its unique orientation of electron&#8208;donor block and acceptor block resulted in largely red&#8208;shifted orange emission both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar3N) and an acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar3B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the block&#8208;type macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites, MC&#8208;alt&#8208;B3N3. The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar3B and amine donor Ar3N components in MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612&#8197;nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer L&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8211;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Specific O&#8208;Selective Hydropyridonation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;IPr catalyst was reported for the synthesis of gem&#8208;O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;oxypyridines by selective O&#8208;addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. A preferable N&#8208;coordination mode within the metallacyclopropene intermediate species causes a seesaw effect responsible for the O&#8208;nucleophilic attack.







Abstract
The dinuclear complex [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)(IPr)]2 is an efficient catalyst for the O&#8208;selective Markovnikov&#8208;type addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. DFT calculations support a hydride&#8208;free pathway entailing intramolecular oxidative protonation of a &#960;&#8208;alkyne by a &#954;1N&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand. Subsequent O&#8208;nucleophilic attack on a metallacyclopropene species affords an O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxypyridine chelate rhodium intermediate as the catalyst resting state. The release of the alkenyl ether is calculated as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Pushing the Length Limit of Dihydrodiboraacenes: Synthesis and Characterizations of Boron&#8208;Embedded Heptacene and Nonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrodiboraheptacene and dihydrodiboranonacene, the hitherto longest boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes, have been successfully synthesized. Both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions through the thermal population mechanism, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of dihydrodiboraheptacene is as high as 98&#177;2&#8201;%. This work provides new opportunities for the development of novel boraacene&#8208;based functional materials.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;embedded heteroacenes (boraacenes) have attracted enormous interest in organic chemistry and materials science. However, extending the skeleton of boraacenes to higher acenes (N&#8805;6) is synthetically challenging because of their limited stability under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of boron&#8208;embedded heptacene (DBH) and nonacene (DBN) as the hitherto longest boraacenes. The former is highly stable (even after 240&#8197;h in tetrahydrofuran), while the latter is air&#8208;sensitive with the half&#8208;life (t1/2) of 11.8&#8197;min. The structures of both compounds are verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing a linear backbone with an antiaromatic C4B2 core. Photophysical characterizations associated with theoretical calculations indicate that both compounds exhibit highly efficient anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable DBH manifests an ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#177;2&#8201;% and can be chemically reduced to its radical anion and dianion states, implying the value of boron&#8208;doped higher acenes as novel functional materials.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Switchable Copolymerization of Lactide, Carbon Dioxide, and Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides to easily synthesize multi&#8208;block copolymers of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC).







Abstract
Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.

         <title>Oxidase&#8208;Type C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Coupling Using an Isoquinoline&#8208;Derived Organic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst was designed and synthesized. This photocatalyst enabled visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with alkanes and aldehydes using air as the sole oxidant. An unconventional mechanism with &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; to generate an isoquinoline N&#8208;radical cation to trigger hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is involved, according to time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopic and mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;type oxidation is an attractive strategy in organic synthesis due to the use of O2 as the terminal oxidant. Organic photocatalysis can effect metal&#8208;free oxidase chemistry. Nevertheless, current methods are limited in reaction scope, possibly due to the lack of suitable photocatalysts. Here we report an isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst, which has much enhanced absorption of blue and visible light compared to conventional diaryl ketones. This photocatalyst enables dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited&#8208;state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; process to generate the N&#8208;radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.

This photocatalyst enables dehydrogenative cross-coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited-state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self-quenching&#8221; process to generate the N-radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosted Inner Surface Charge Transfer in Perovskite Nanodots@Mesoporous Titania Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9, Cs2AgBiBr6) are grown in situ in a mesoporous titania framework for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A benchmarked production rate of CH4 (32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) is achieved with selectivity values of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, respectively. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy reveal that the inner surface built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels can efficiently promote photo&#8208;induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency and stable halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to methane is a challenge because of the intrinsic photo&#8208; and chemical instability of halide perovskites. In this study, halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs2AgBiBr6) were grown in situ in mesoporous TiO2 frameworks for an efficient CO2 reduction. Benchmarked CH4 production rates of 32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivities of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, were achieved, respectively, which are better than most reported halide perovskite photocatalysts. Focused ion&#8208;beam sliced&#8208;imaging techniques were used to directly image the hyperdispersed perovskite nanodots confined in mesopores with tunable sizes ranging from 3.8 to 9.9&#8197;nm. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy showed that the built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels efficiently promoted photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high methane selectivity was attributed to the Bi&#8208;adsorption&#8208;mediated hydrogenation of *CO to *HCO that dominates CO desorption.

         <title>Direct Dehydrogenative Access to Unsymmetrical Phenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction is an emblematic method for constructing C&#8722;C bonds at aromatic positions. Rendering this reaction dehydrogenative on a broad scope of substrates under simple reaction conditions constitutes an important milestone for synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The first non&#8208;directed dehydrogenative phenone coupling method of methylarenes with aromatic C&#8722;H bonds, displaying a large substrate scope, is herein reported. This reaction represents a far more direct atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient alternative to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura derived acylation reactions. The method can be carried out on a gram scale and was successfully applied to the synthesis of several Ketoprofen drug analogues.

         <title>Topochemical Postulates: Are They Relevant for Topochemical Reactions Occurring at Elevated Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A inositol&#8208;derived monomer decorated with azide and alkyne groups as reactive units, crystallizes as three distinct polymorphs. Though all the reactive units are not preorganized for topochemical reaction in pristine crystals, at high temperatures the trimorphs undergo regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;yl&#8208;linked polyinositol. A large cooperative molecular motion in the crystal lattice enabled this topochemical reaction.







Abstract
A rigid inositol&#8208;derived monomer functionalized with azide and alkyne as the complementary reactive groups (CRGs) crystallized as three distinct polymorphs I&#8211;III. Despite the unsuitable orientation of CRGs in the crystals for complete polymerization, all the three polymorphs underwent regiospecific and quantitative topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization upon heating to yield three different polymorphs of 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl&#8208;linked&#8208;poly&#8208;neo&#8208;inositol. The molecules in these polymorphs exploit the weak intermolecular interactions, free space in the crystal lattice, and heat energy for their large and cooperative molecular motion to attain a transient reactive orientation, ultimately leading to the regiospecific TAAC reaction yielding distinct crystalline polymers. This study cautions that the overreliance on topochemical postulates for the prediction of topochemical reactivity at high temperatures could be misleading.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble perylene diimide (PDI) cyclophane consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double cationic molecular straps has been synthesized. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, self&#8208;aggregation of the chromophore in water is completely eliminated, which enables the cyclophane to be employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging and antibacterial applications.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double&#8208;sided cationic molecular straps. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2&#8197;mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.

Details of this study are reported by Qinqin Shi, Hui Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202115969"&gt;10.1002/anie.202115969&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic synthesis of eight luciferin analogues from phenolic derivatives in one&#8208;pot reactions is reported by Pimchai Chaiyen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116908). Two novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues with methyl substituents were obtained; these compounds emit red and brighter light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. Also developed was a new detection technology named LUMOS for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos and fenitrothion at parts per trillion (ppt) levels without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <title>A Nonenzymatic Analog of Pyrimidine Nucleobase Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic theories for the origin of life posit that inorganic catalysts enabled self&#8208;organized chemical precursors to the pathways of metabolism, including those that make genetic molecules. Recently, experiments showing nonenzymatic versions of a number of core metabolic pathways have started to support this idea. However, experimental demonstrations of nonenzymatic reaction sequences along the  de novo  ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathways are limited. Here we show that all three reactions of pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis that convert aspartate to orotate proceed at 60 &#186;C without photochemistry under aqueous conditions in the presence of metals such as Cu  2+  and Mn  4+  . Combining reactions into one&#8208;pot variants is also possible. Life may not have invented pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis from scratch, but simply refined existing nonenzymatic reaction channels. This work is a first step towards uniting metabolic theories of life&#8217;s origin with those centered around genetic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both HTM layer and perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing  PE10  as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3% and dramatically enhanced the device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Disulfide Exchange Polymerization of Polyguanidine for Effective Biomedical Applications by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New preparation methods of vectors are the key to developing next generation of biomacromolecule delivery systems. In this study, a controllable disulfide exchange polymerization was established to obtain low&#8208;toxicity and efficient bioreducible polyguanidines (mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSSn, n = 13, 26, 39, 75, 105) by regulating the concentration of activated nucleophiles and reaction time under mild reaction conditions. The relationship between the degrees of polymerization and biocompatibility was studied to identify the optimal polyguanidine mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26. Such polyguanidine exhibited good in virto performance in delivering different functional nucleic acids. The impressive therapeutic effects of mPEG225&#8208;b&#8208;PSS26 were further verified in the 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice as well as the mice with full&#8208;thickness skin defects. Controllable disulfide exchange polymerization provides an attractive strategy for the construction of new biomacromolecule delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of new bioorthogonal reactions with mutual orthogonality to classic bioorthogonal reactions such as the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction and the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is of great importance in providing chemical tools for multiplex labelling of live cells. Here we report the first anionic cycloaddend&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal cycloaddition reaction between phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione and furan&#8208;2( 3H  )&#8208;one derivatives, where the high polarity of water is exploited to stabilize the highly electron&#8208;rich anionic cycloaddend. The reaction is metal&#8208; and strain&#8208;free, which proceeds rapidly in aqueous solution and on live cells with a second&#8208;order rate constants up to 119 M &#8208;1  s &#8208;1  . The combined utilization of this reaction together with the two other widely used bioorthogonal reactions allows for mutually orthogonal labelling of three types of proteins or three groups of living cells in one batch without cross&#8208;talking. Such results highlight the great potential for multiplex labelling of different biomolecules in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>(Hetero)aryl&#8210;S(VI) Fluorides: Synthetic Development and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arylsulfur compounds where the S atom is in the oxidation state (VI) represent a large percentage of the molecular functionalities present in organic chemistry. More specifically, (hetero)aryl&#8210;S(VI) fluorides have recently received enormous attention due to their potential as chemical biology probes, as a result of their reactivity in a simple, modular and ef&#64257;cient manner. Whereas the synthesis and application of the level 1 of fluorination at S(VI) (sulfonyl and sulfonimidoyl fluorides) have been widely studied and reviewed, the synthetic strategies towards higher levels of fluorination (level 2 to 5) are somewhat more limited. This Minireview evaluates and summarizes the progress in the synthesis of highly fluorinated aryl&#8210;S(VI) compounds at all levels, discussing synthetic strategies, reactivity, the advantages and disadvantages of the synthetic protocols, the proposed mechanisms and the potential upcoming opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines:&#160;Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8208;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Free Ring&#8211;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ring&#8211;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn &#8804; 9.4 kg/mol) with relatively low dispersities (&#272; &#8804; 1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Lactonization of Alkynylmalonic Acids Enabled by Chiral Bifunctional P,N ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the linear coordination nature of gold(I) catalysts, achieving high enantiocontrol in asymmetric gold catalysis is a big challenge. To improve the enantiocontrol of gold catalysis, an ion&#8208;pairing strategy was therefore proposed. A series of bifunctional P,N ligands based on chiral spirocyclic and biaryl scaffolds were synthesized and applied in the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric lactonization of alkynylmalonic acids. A wide range of chiral lactones containing an &#945;&#8208;position quaternary stereocenter were synthesized with high yields, excellent regioselectivity and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utilities of the current reaction were demonstrated by gram scale synthesis and transformations of chiral lactones. The origin of enantioselectivity and the role of the alcohol additive were elucidated  via  control experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Readily Tunable Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Catalyst for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral half&#8208;sandwich cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) (CpRh  III  ) complexes are powerful catalysts to promote asymmetric C&#8208;H activation reactions. Their preparation normally involved linking or embedding the Cp motif to or into a certain chiral backbone to forge the so&#8208;called chiral Cp ligand. However, preparation of planar&#8208;chiral CpRh  III  catalyst bearing a non&#8208;chiral Cp ligand remains a formidable challenge and rarely reported. We describe herein an unusual class of planar&#8208;chiral rhodium catalysts bearing non&#8208;chiral Cp ligands. Differed from existing ones, this catalyst is facile to tune. Twelve chiral CpRh  III  catalysts had been prepared with ease, and successfully used into two enantioselective C&#8208;H activation reactions. Given its convenient synthesis and high structural tunability, this catalyst is expected to find more utilities in asymmetric C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA fa cilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA de hybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing &#160; the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Coordination to a High Spin Diiron(I/II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen coordination to iron centers underpins industrial and biological fixation in the Haber&#8208;Bosch process and by the FeM cofactors in the nitrogenase enzymes. The latter employ local high spin metal centers; however, iron&#8208;dinitrogen coordination chemistry remains dominated by low valent states, contrasting the enzyme systems. &#160;Here, we report a high&#8208;spin mixed&#8208;valent  cis&#8208;  (  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex [(FeBr)  2  (&#956;&#8208;N  2  )  L  bis  ]  &#8211;  (  2  ) where [  L  bis  ]  &#8211;  is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane.

The latter employ local high spin metal centers; however, iron-dinitrogen coordination chemistry remains dominated by low valent states, contrasting the enzyme systems. &#160;Here, we report a high-spin mixed-valent  cis-  (  &#956;  -1,2-dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex [(FeBr)  2  (&#956;-N  2  )  L  bis  ]  &#8211;  (  2  ) where [  L  bis  ]  &#8211;  is a bis(&#946;-diketiminate) cyclophane.

         <title>Achieving 37.1% Green Electroluminescent Efficiency and 0.09 eV Full Width at Half Maximum Based on a Ternary Boron&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Nitrogen Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a ternary boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;nitrogen embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with multiple resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), namely DBNO, is developed by adopting the  para  boron&#8208;&#960;&#8208;boron and  para  oxygen&#8208;&#960;&#8208;oxygen strategy. The designed molecule presents a vivid green emission with high photoluminescence quantum yield (96%) and extremely narrow    full width at half maximum  (FWHM) of 19 nm/0.09 eV, which surpasses all previously reported green TADF emitters to date. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction endows it with a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio of 96%. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on DBNO reveals a narrowband green emission with a peak at 504 nm and a FWHM of 24 nm/0.12 eV. Particularly, a significantly improved device performance is achieved by the TADF&#8208;sensitization (  hyperfluorescence  ) mechanism, presenting a FWHM of 27 nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 37.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Productivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Enhancing CO2 Diffusion through Porous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO2 electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO2 to the surface of catalysts using the porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1% with a current density of 1.7 A cm&#8208;2 when Cu&#8208;nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu&#8208;nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb large amount of CO2 for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO2 in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO2 molecules contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO2 reduction and inhibting generation of H2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study provided an effective strategy to construct dual&#8208;atom sites by solid&#8208;solution alloying. A slow synthesis methodology was established for the solid solution preparations as dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts. The atomic&#8208;level homogeneous Pd  x  Rh  1&#8722;x  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts were successfully synthesized over the whole composition range, as convinced by the X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope&#8208;energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy mapping measurements. The challenging morphology formation in immiscible alloys was achieved by an energy controlling process as the octahedral Rh&#8208;rich alloys. The Pd  0.3  Rh  0.7  dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst had unique surface states to activate the key reactants of CO and NO in the complex three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and it performed significantly better than pure Rh.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Biology Tools for Protein Lysine Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine acylation plays pivotal roles in cell physiology, including DNA transcription and repair, signal transduction, immune defense, metabolism, and many other key cellular processes. Molecular mechanisms of dysregulated lysine acylation are closely involved in the pathophysiological progress of many human diseases, most notably cancers. In recent years, chemical biology tools have become instrumental in studying the function of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), identifying new &#8216;writers&#8217;, &#8216;erasers&#8217; and &#8216;readers&#8217;, and in targeted therapies. Here, we describe key developments in chemical biology approaches that have advanced the study of lysine acylation and its regulatory proteins (2016&#8208;2021). We further discuss the discovery of ligands (inhibitors and PROTACs) that are capable of targeting regulators of lysine acylation. Next, we discuss some current challenges of these chemical biology probes and suggest how chemists and biologists can utilize chemical probes with more discriminating capacity. Finally, we suggest some critical considerations in future studies of PTMs from our perspectives.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the enantioselective synthesis of Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs), which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;DHPs were used as substrates, and the methyl group at the 2&#8208; or 6&#8208;position of the 1,4&#8208;DHP was selectively monobrominated by desymmetrizing enantioselective bromination. The inert C&#8211;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8211;Br bond, which guaranteed the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Spectroscopy Unveils the Catalytic Role of Different Palladium Oxidation States in CO oxidation on Pd/CeO2 catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at knowledge&#8208;driven design of novel metal&#8208;ceria catalysts for automotive exhaust abatement, current efforts mostly pertain to the synthesis and understanding of well&#8208;defined systems. In contrast, technical catalysts are often heterogenous in their metal speciation. Here, we unveiled rich structural dynamics of a conventional impregnated Pd/CeO2 catalyst during CO oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed presence of metallic and oxidic Pd states during the reaction. Using transient operando infrared spectroscopy, we probed the nature and reactivity of the surface intermediates involved in CO oxidation. We found that while low&#8208;temperature activity is associated with sub&#8208;oxidized and interfacial Pd sites, the reaction at elevated temperatures involves metallic Pd. These results highlight the utility of the multi&#8208;technique operando approach for establishing structure&#8208;activity relationships of technical catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from  Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33 days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6 mA cm  &#8208;2  , the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86 C cm  &#8208;2  , the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Cu&#8208;C Bond in Graphdiyne&#8208;Regulated Cu Single Atom Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating intermediates through elaborating catalyst design to control reaction direction is crucial for promoting the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  . M&#8211;C (M = metal) bonds are particularly important for tuning multi&#8208;electron reaction, however, its construction in nanomaterials is challenging. Here, via rational design of in&#8208;situ anchoring Cu SAs (single atoms) on the unique platform graphdiyne, we firstly realize the construction of chemical bond Cu&#8208;C (GDY). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations confirm due to the fabrication of Cu&#8208;C bond, during CO  2  reduction, the formation of *OCHO intermediates is dominant rather than *COOH on Cu atoms, facilitating the formation of CH  4  . Therefore, we find that constructing Cu&#8208;C bond in Cu SAs/GDY can supply efficient charge transfer channel, but most importantly control the reaction intermediates and guide a more facile reaction pathway to CH  4  , thereby significantly boost its catalytic performance. This work provides new insights on enhancing the selectivity for CO  2  RR at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA&#8208;based plasmonic nanodevice for cascade signal amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, origami nanodevice&#8208;based plasmonic system, which performs DNA&#8208;regulated, cascade amplification of faint chemical/biological signals. In this system, two gold&#8208;nanorods (GNRs) are co&#8208;assembled onto a DNA lock&#8208;containing, tweezer&#8208;like DNA origami template. Logic circuits serve as recognition and amplification elements for specific messengers, producing DNA keys for driving conformational changes of the plasmonic nanodevices. In the presence of input signals including nucleic acids, adenosines, chiral tyrosinamides or specific receptors expressed by tumor cells, the plasmonic nanodevices can be activated to perform dynamic structural motions, reporting robust responses  via  plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes. This DNA nanodevice&#8208;based system provides a different design to enrich the strategies for constructing synthetic nanomachines, enabling the customized bottom&#8208;up nanostructure construction for sensitive biological signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres and Prodrugs for Inhibition of the Human SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is a protein lysine deacylase enzyme that regulates diverse biology by hydrolyzing &#949;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyalkyllysine posttranslational modifications in the cell. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been linked to potential treatment of several cancers but potent compounds with activity in cells have been lacking. Here we developed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors that incorporate isosteres of a carboxylic acid residue that is important for high&#8208;affinity binding to the enzyme active site. By masking of the tetrazole moiety of the most potent candidate from our initial SAR study, we achieved potent and cytoselective growth inhibition for the treatment of SIRT5&#8208;dependent leukemic cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, we provide an efficient, cellularly active small molecule that targets SIRT5, which can help elucidate its function and potential as a future drug target. This work shows that masked biosisosteres of carboxylic acids are viable chemical motifs for the development of inhibitors that target mitochondrial enzymes, which may have applications beyond the sirtuin field.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV&#8208;vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8208;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2),which shows unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility of 2.7 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and low&#8208;threshold lasing characters of 9.43 &#181;J cm  &#8208;2  and 9.93 &#181;J cm  &#8208;2  and high&#8208;quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443 nm, respectively. More deep theoretical calculation and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36 ~ 45.16 meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  is responsible for the achievement of superior integrated optoelectronic properties in LD&#8208;2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD&#8208;2 are among of the highest reported low&#8208;threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promising for research of EPOLs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A remote C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bond asymmetric borylation of unactivated alkenes has been achieved for the first time by bimetallic relay catalysis.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia with Copper Supported Rhodium Cluster and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) provides a promising solution for restoring the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle while enabling a sustainable and decentralized route to source ammonia. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrocatalyst for NITRR consisting of Rh clusters and single&#8208;atoms dispersed onto Cu nanowires (NWs), which delivers a partial current density of 162 mA cm&#8722;2 for NH3 production and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93% at &#8722;0.2 V vs. RHE. The highest ammonia yield rate reached a record value of 1.27 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations by electron spin resonance, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory modeling suggest that the high activity originates from the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu sites, whereby adsorbed hydrogen on Rh sites transfer to vicinal *NO intermediate species adsorbed on Cu promoting the hydrogenation and ammonia formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide and Formate by an Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyst in Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalyst comprised of binary organic polymer dots (Pdots) was prepared. The Pdots were constructed from poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;  alt  &#8208;benzothiadiazole), as an electron donor, and 1&#8208;[3&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;[6.6]C  61  , as an electron acceptor. The photocatalyst produces H  2  O  2  in alkaline conditions (1 M KOH) with a production rate of up to 188 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  . The external quantum efficiencies were 30% (5 min) and 14% (75 min) at 450 nm. Furthermore, photo&#8208;oxidation of methanol by Pdots, followed by a disproportionation reaction and an oxidation reaction, produced the high&#8208;value chemical&#160;formate. On the basis of various spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, the photophysical processes of the system were studied in detail and a reaction mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple molecular barcoding strategy is proposed based on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic DNA oligomers and direct nanopore decoding. The composition of the barcode probe is highly programmable, and in principle 14n unique step&#8208;shaped barcode patterns can be generated without nanopore sequencing. Different protein and microRNA targets were identified using this strategy, showing its generality in single molecule sensing.







Abstract
A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14n unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Fluorescent Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Atom&#8208;Precise Cu8 Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the scheme of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), optical&#8208;engineering was performed for real&#8208;time monitoring of the self&#8208;assembly process of Cu8a with various kinetic long&#8208;lived intermediates, leading to a structure&#8211;property relationship being established.







Abstract
Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in monitoring the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise CuI nanocluster [Cu8(tBuC6H4S)8(PPh3)4] (Cu8a) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of Cu8a is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (CD) to Cu8a aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.

Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self-assembly (DSA) process of &lt;b&gt;Cu8a&lt;/b&gt; is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (&lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt;) to &lt;b&gt;Cu8a&lt;/b&gt; aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic fabrication (left) is used to prepare a two aqueous phase microcapsule (right), which releases a model drug payload on demand in response to focused ultrasound actuation.







Abstract
Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4&#8197;&#956;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method for the straightforward synthesis of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported via an unprecedented, redox&#8208;neutral Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation. A rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor delivers the monocyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) species.







Abstract
A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as the underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (up to 35&#8197;h) for the generation of intense anti&#8208;Stokes photoinduced electrochemiluminescence onto the whole surface of the metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) photoanode or at a specifically&#8208;chosen location. These results provide solutions for overcoming the instability that has hampered the practical application of upconversion photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL).







Abstract
Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiOx/metal (SiOx/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.

         <title>Ratiometric and Colorimetric Optical Thermometers Using Emissive Dimeric and Trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}n Moieties Generated in d&#8211;f Heterometallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 ions were incorporated in two different supramolecular matrices with GdIII and YIII. The resulting materials exhibit characteristic Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational peaks investigated by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The formation of Au2 and Au3 moieties yields strong photoluminescence with rich color tunability, providing high&#8208;performance colorimetric and ratiometric thermometer abilities.







Abstract
Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au2]&#8594;[Au2]*) and exciplexes ([Au3]&#8594;[Au3]*) with light excitation. Four GdIII and YIII complexes were assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational mode was probed with ultralow frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy was used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions were associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence measurements showed that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green via cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as colorimetric thermometers. Additionally, a ratiometric thermal sensing ability was incorporated with high sensitivity up to 5&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the cryogenic temperature range.

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic tandem reaction integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was developed to access tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones in a single step from readily available linear precursors. To illustrate the feasibility of the synthetic strategy, an antitumor marine macrolide, (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, was synthesized in just 13 steps from a commercially available compound.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our tandem reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM), including crystallographic analysis, is described. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM causes its high reactivity, making it capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl group. This study paves an avenue for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.







Abstract
Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface with oxygen plasma assists the formation of highly dense and stable Pt single atoms resistant to sintering under CO oxidation conditions. The effect is assigned to plasma&#8208;induced oxide nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo species which favor single&#8208;atom metal adsorption. This approach can be utilized for the preparation of stable single&#8208;atom catalysts with a high density of active sites.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO2 films and theory, we show that the O2 plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O22&#8722;) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt2+ atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on powder Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium superionic conductor with low activation energy: W&#8208;doped K3SbS4 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional K migration pathway and a low activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature and is then used in K&#8722;S batteries to block the polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K3SbS4 with a low&#8208;activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. W&#8208;doped K3&#8722;xSb1&#8722;xWxS4 (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 is electrochemically stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K2Sx. A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8722;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.







Abstract
While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.

&lt;p&gt;The first electrochemical transition-metal-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;3&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While electrochemical &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;3&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand- and electrolyte-free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron-rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Dyes into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark BODIPY dyes are able to fully recover their fluorescence properties when linked via a flexible ethylene tether. Various excited state deactivation channels are shown to become drastically mitigated by formation of stable excitons within conformationally unstable, discrete superstructures. This study might open doors to a novel assay for detection and visualization of spatial, molecular encounters.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.

         <title>Leveraging Electron&#8208;Deficient Iminium Intermediates in a General Synthesis of Valuable Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of aminals as precursors for iminium ion has been limited to methylene derivatives, thus hampering its broader use. By employing electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions an obvious hurdle of the methodology is overcome, whilst generating highly desirable motifs. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.







Abstract
The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.

         <title>Building a Beyond Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly aggregated ether electrolyte is rationally constructed by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. Benefitting from the highly aggregated electrolyte configuration, it enables a dramatically improved oxidative stability. Under the extremely harsh anode&#8208;free conditions, the high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Na battery configuration has an ultrahigh energy density of 369&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0&#8197;V class cathodes.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate for the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration comprising a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. A 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It suppresses the trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5&#8197;V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91&#8201;%). Thus, we can make anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells.

         <title>A Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst for the Polymerization of Olefins Prepared by Halide Abstraction Using Surface R3Si+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylium&#8208;like ion supported on silica ionizes a Pd&#8722;Cl complex by chloride abstraction to generate a very active catalyst for (co&#8208;)polymerization reactions.







Abstract
The silylium&#8208;like surface species [iPr3Si][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] activates (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl (N^N=Ar&#8722;N=CMeMeC=N&#8722;Ar, Ar=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzene) by chloride ion abstraction to form [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] (1). A combination of FTIR, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and reactions with CO or vinyl chloride establish that 1 shows similar reactivity patterns as (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl activated with Na[B(ArF)4]. Multinuclear 13C{27Al} RESPDOR and 1H{19F} S&#8208;REDOR experiments are consistent with a weakly coordinated ion&#8208;pair between (N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3+ and [(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)]. 1 catalyzes the polymerization of ethylene with similar activities as [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3]+ in solution and incorporates up to 0.4&#8201;% methyl acrylate in copolymerization reactions. 1 produces polymers with significantly higher molecular weight than the solution catalyst, and generates the highest molecular weight polymers currently reported in copolymerization reactions of ethylene and methylacrylate.

Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)6] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H2 and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation of Heteroarenes for the Synthesis of Acyclic Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes has been developed. This process proceeds via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.

The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of&#160;  C  2  symmetric axially chiral&#160;  cis  &#160;and&#160;  trans  &#8208;stilbene&#8208;dicarboxylic esters was also achieved by the double [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of two molecules of the 1,6&#8208;diyne with&#160; 2,3&#8208;dialkynylmaleate and 2,3&#8208;dialkynylfumarate, respectively.&#160; In these reactions, the 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;carboxylic esters coordinating to rhodium with a five&#8208;membered chelate were more reactive than those coordinating to rhodium with a six&#8208;membered chelate, although both chelation modes realized excellent enantioselectivity. The enantioselection mechanism of the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;controlled [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition &#160;was elucidated by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation strategy for perovskite CsPbX  3  (CPX, X = Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) to improve their stability in polar solvents and simultaneously maintaining their optical performance without using complicated organics. Here, we describe a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with combined effects of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents and also propose a possible fundamental mechanism. Monodispersed CsPbBr  3  (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in water for 96 h&#65292;which implies that their structures are unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskites CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements:&#160;the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (a wide bandgap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide bandgap (5.88 eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0 &#215; KH2PO4) &#8211; both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides &#8211; as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged bandgap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Thioetherification via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Photoactivation using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8211;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8211;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation, tolerating a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp  2  )&#8211;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8208;X bond cleavage protocols. Additionally, various mechanistic investigations support the envisioned EDA complex scenario.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B  2  pin  2  using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1 V with a capacity of 115 mAh g  &#8208;1  and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67% of its original capacity after 2000 cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterion&#8208;paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategy to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime  . Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600 nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120 nm and 1319 excitation, enabling HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEASCN (2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate) was synthesized to construct a bilayer structure on a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite surface, which can passivate perovskite and ensure effective carriers transfer, enabling the device to reach a certified efficiency of 21.1&#8201;%. The mechanism for the growth of the uniform bilayer structure is revealed by simulation based on density functional theory.







Abstract
The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. A 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large band gap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on a tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate the perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow band gap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN makes the bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structures.

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanopore sensing assay is developed to resolve cascade reactions of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. In a confined environment such as liposomes, substrate&#8208;channelling effects are observed between two sets of the three enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channelling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8211;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channelling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channelling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.

         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) reaction of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;amino acids with dienol ethers enabled by a photoredox/palladium dual catalytic system is presented. With the developed method, a broad variety of substrates was deployed to deliver vicinal amino tertiary ethers in good to excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a reversible hydropalladation of 1,3&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAA reactions, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAA of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method enables the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for a few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.

         <dc:description>
A silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion was synthesized. This compound exhibits an extremely elongated bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a near&#8208;IR absorption (&#955;max=922&#8197;nm) in solution attributed to the HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. Furthermore, this silicon radical anion presents a new bonding motif which appears to be the first example of a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221;.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Type 3&#8208;electron&#8208;2&#8208;center (3e&#8208;2c) bonds have been extensively studied as one of the key bonding motifs in radical chemistry and some biological systems. &#8220;&#960;&#8208;Type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221; that contain a 3e&#8208;2c &#960;&#8208;bond without an underlying &#963;&#8208;bond framework, however, have been unexplored so far both theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a strong near&#8208;IR absorption at 922&#8197;nm in solution which arises from a HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;&#8208;type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*&#8208;type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of NO3&#8722; is achieved by connecting NO3&#8722; to an ether&#8208;based moiety. The broken resonance structure of &#8722;NO3 improves its reducibility compared with NO3&#8722;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO3 forms a LiNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8722; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8722; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8722;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

         <title>Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Gd atoms into a Ni&#8208;based catalyst readily changes local electron densities of the Ni 3d orbitals and strengthens the electronic activity. The resulting Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst achieves high selectivity, large current density and outstanding stability in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and a large current density (308&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100&#8197;h).

         <title>Photo&#8208;Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus&#8208;Targeting PtIV Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The example of PtIV nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The complex was functionalized with a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII, presenting a multimodal treatment by chemotherapy and photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their PtII therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the example of PtIV&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with PtIV complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to eradicate a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is demonstrated as a promising etchant for controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancy defects down to a rate of a few &#197; per minute while completely avoiding the nucleation of new vacancy defects. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion.







Abstract
A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3&#8197;&#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2 expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71&#8197;eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2. We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2 etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitution of Methyl Azaarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution of a variety of methyl azaarenes, including (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline, is described. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are afforded in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Herein, an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction of methyl azaarenes is described. Azaarenes such as (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline are all tolerated. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The utilization of the Knochel reagent TMPZnBr&#8901;LiBr warrants the in situ formation of benzylic nucleophiles without additional activating reagents. 1H&#8197;NMR studies suggested a two&#8208;fold function of the Knochel reagent in this reaction. The synthetic utility of this method has been showcased by a concise enantioselective synthesis of an allosteric protein kinase modulator.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Prenylation Reaction of Carbazole&#8208;Containing Natural Products Catalyzed by Squalene Synthase&#8208;Like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole prenyltransferase was found to combine the overall structure of squalene synthase and the elegant stacking interaction between prenyl diphosphate and aromatic compounds observed in the aromatic substrate prenyltransferase. Structural and mutational analyses revealed the binding and deprotonation mechanisms of the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor.







Abstract
Some enzymes annotated as squalene synthase catalyze the prenylation of carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone&#8208;containing substrates in bacterial secondary metabolism. Their reaction mechanisms remain unclear because of their low sequence similarity to well&#8208;characterized aromatic substrate prenyltransferases (PTs). We determined the crystal structures of the carbazole PTs, and these revealed that the overall structure is well superposed on those of squalene synthases. In contrast, the stacking interaction between the prenyl donor and acceptor substrates resembles those observed in aromatic substrate PTs. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the Ile and Asp residues are essential for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor, respectively, and a deprotonation mechanism of an intermediary &#963;&#8208;complex involving a catalytic triad is proposed. Our results provide a structural basis for a new subclass of aromatic substrate PTs.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>

A stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt(IV) complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold is very active in the catalysis of water oxidation at an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV at pH=6.







Abstract
Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the CoIV center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high spin state (sextet, S=5/2). The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated based on theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important regarding the accessibility of high&#8208;oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.

Large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening is a multiplexed widefield screening approach for particle characterization. The method is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations and simultaneously measures SERS and particle size.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle characterization, which is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample's Raman and Rayleigh scattering to directly quantify the fraction of SERS&#8208;active particles which allows for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with particle size. .

         <dc:description>C(sp  3  )&#8210;H &#160;bond coupling with carbon electrophiles remains rarely explored under thermo&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) conditions due to a challenge of integrating oxidation and reduction in a single operation.

         <title>Pincer Ligand Bearing bis&#8208;(Carbone) and its Coordinative Behavior Toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbones are divalent carbon (0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free  bis  &#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This  bis  &#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8211;Pd&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;Ni&#8211;Au, and Cu&#8211;Ni&#8211;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8208;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the  bis  &#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoaffinity capture compounds to profile the Magic Spot Nucleotide interactomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magic Spot Nucleotides (MSN) regulate the stringent response, a highly conserved bacterial stress adaptation mechanism, enabling survival under adverse external challenges. In times of antibiotic crisis, a detailed understanding of stringent response is essential, as potentially new targets for pharmacological intervention could be identified. In this study, we delineate the MSN interactome in&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;and&#160;Salmonella typhimurium&#160;applying a family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds. We introduce MSN probes covering diverse phosphorylation pattern, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that, unveil new MSN targets. We find, that the activity of the non&#8208;Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH. The capture compounds described herein will be useful to identify MSN interactomes across bacterial species</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Modulation of Spiro Structure for Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule with a fused, planar architecture tends to aggregate at high doping ratios, resulting in broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), redshifting electroluminescence peaks, and low device efficiency. Herein, we propose a mono&#8208;substituted design strategy by introducing spiro&#8208;9,9'&#8208;bifluorene (SBF) units with different substituted sites into the MR&#8208;TADF system for the first time. As a classic steric group, SBF can hinder interchromophore interactions, leading to high device efficiency (32.2&#8208;35.9%) and narrow&#8208;band emission (~27 nm). Particularly, the shield&#8208;like molecule, SF1BN, seldom exhibits a broadened FWHM as the doping ratio rises, which differs from the C3&#8208;substituted isomer and unhindered parent emitter. These results manifest an effective method for constructing highly efficient MR&#8208;TADF emitters through a spiro strategy and elucidate the feasibility for steric modulation of spiro structure in &#960;&#8208;framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrothermal Flow&#8208;Enhanced Magneto Biosensor for Highly Sensitive Protein Detection in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current diagnostic tests for sensitive protein detection rely on immunological techniques, such as ELISA, which require sample purification, multiple washing steps and lengthy incubation, hindering their use for rapid testing. Here, we report a simple electrothermal flow&#8208;enhanced biosensor for ultrafast, high sensitivity measurements of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Magnetic nanobeads dually&#8208;labeled with a detection antibody and enzyme reporter are used to form immunocomplexes with the target protein, which are readily transported to the sensor via magnetic concentration. The incorporation of electrothermal flows enhances immunocomplex formation, allowing for rapid and sensitive detection without requiring blood purification or lengthy incubation. Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine&#8208;rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7 pg/mL (95 fM) in whole blood in 7 min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.</dc:description>

Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7 pg/mL (95 fM) in whole blood in 7 min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles through Asymmetric Electrophilic Aromatic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles (paracyclophanes) has been disclosed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide range of chiral macrocycles bearing varied ring sizes (16 to 23&#8208;membered) and functional group&#8208;containing ansa chains were readily afforded using this method, with excellent yields and high enantioselectivities (23 examples, up to 99.5:0.5 er). Experimental studies and DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism and origin of stereoselectivities of these reactions. Preliminary utilization of the planar&#8208;chiral macrocycle as chiral organocatalyst showcased the potential applications of these novel chiral skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26 W/m2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further leads to an improvement of the power density to 7.74 W/m2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid Halide Perovskite Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter&#8208;wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr  4  (MLA = melamine), which features a (110)&#8208;oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s  2  lone&#8208;pair electrons of Pb  2+  cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr  4  exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550 nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;&#8208;conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr  6  octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

When introduced into the protein dimer interface, CATKs permitted spontaneous, proximity&#8208;driven, site&#8208;selective crosslinking to generate covalent protein dimers in living cells, with phenyl&#8208;bearing CATK&#8208;  1  exhibiting high reactivity toward the proximal Lys and Tyr. Furthermore, when introduced into the  N  &#8208;terminal  &#946;  &#8208;strand of either a single&#8208;chain VHH antibody or a supercharged monobody, CATK&#8208;  1  enabled site&#8208;specific, inter&#8208;strand, orthogonal crosslinking with a proximal Tyr located on the opposing  &#946;  &#8208;strand. Compared with a non&#8208;crosslinked monobody, the orthogonally crosslinked monobody displayed improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic stability against an endosomal enzyme. The robust crosslinking reactivity of CATKs should facilitate the design of novel protein topologies with improved physicochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole equipped with four oxazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyrazinyl units at its upper rim is reported. Its Pt(II)/Pd(II)&#8208;metallobridged cavitand counterparts were obtained by treatment with 2 equiv. of cis&#8208;protected metal corners, [M(dppp)(OTf)2] (dppp = 1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane). The metal corners arranged their axial phenyl substituents near the aromatic walls of the cavitand leading to the formation of inclusion complexes as single conformers. We characterized the inclusion complexes in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Selected complexes were also characterized in the gas&#8208;phase and in the solid&#8208;state using mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the open portals of the dinuclear complexes were found to be dependent on the included guest. The results of DFT calculations served to explain the dissimilar complexation&#8208;induced shifts observed in the dinuclear inclusion complexes with mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;formamide guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits . However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;established [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, the catalytic enantioselective [3+n] (n&#8805;3) cycloaddition reaction of activated isocyanides for the preparation of six&#8208;membered or larger ring systems has remained underdeveloped. Herein, we report&#160;the first example of highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines. By employing silver catalysis, a wide range of biologically important bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with good to excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 99% ee). In addition, the same catalytic system could be applied to both the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines, further highlighting its versatility and synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+1) Cycloaddition between Benzocyclobutenones and Styrene&#8208;Type Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a unique one&#8208;carbon ring&#8208;expansion strategy to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones from benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type olefins. The use of a cationic &#8220;ligandless&#8221; rhodium catalyst was the key for both high reactivity and selectivity towards the (4+1) product. Broad functional group tolerance, a good substrate scope, and scalability have been demonstrated. Computation studies reveal that the origin of the (4+1) selectivity is due to a facile &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway that reduces the overall barrier of the turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8722;C reductive elimination step.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;addressable single&#8208;molecule junctions incorporating a persistent organic radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating radical (open&#8208;shell) species into non&#8208;cryogenic nanodevices is key to unlocking the potential of molecular electronics. While many efforts have been devoted to this issue, in the absence of a chemical/electrochemical potential the open&#8208;shell character is generally lost in contact with the metallic electrodes. Here, single&#8208;molecule devices incorporating a 6&#8208;oxo&#8208;verdazyl persistent radical have been fabricated using break&#8208;junction techniques. The open&#8208;shell character is retained at room temperature, and electrochemical gating permits  in&#8208;situ  reduction to a closed&#8208;shell anionic state in a single&#8208;molecule transistor configuration. Furthermore, electronically&#8208;driven rectification arises from bias&#8208;dependent alignment of the open&#8208;shell resonances. The integration of radical character, transistor&#8208;like switching, and rectification in a single molecular component paves the way to further studies of the electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties of open&#8208;shell species.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Immunosuppressive Cyclophilin Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophilins, enzymes with a peptidyl prolyl  cis  /  trans  isomerase activity, are relevant to a large variety of biological processes. The most abundant member of this enzyme family, cyclophilin A, is the cellular receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Due to the pathophysiological role of cyclophilins, particularly in viral infections, there is a broad interest in cyclophilin inhibition, devoid of immunosuppressive activity. In this overview an introduction into the physiological and pathophysiological roles of cyclophilins will be given first. The presentation of non&#8208;immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors will commence with drugs based on chemical modifications of CsA. The macrocyclic naturally occurring sanglifehrins became another lead structure for cyclophilin&#8208;inhibiting drugs. Finally, de&#8208;novo designed compounds, whose structures are not derived from or inspired by natural products, will be presented. Relevant synthetic concepts will be discussed but a focus will equally be on biochemical studies, structure&#8208;activity relationship, and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polymer Brushes for Protein Capture and Release in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfaces functionalized with polymers are known for providing excellent resistance towards biomolecular adsorption and for their ability to bind high amounts of protein while preserving their structure. However, making an interface that switches between these two states has proven challenging and concepts to date rely on changes in the physiochemical environment, which is static in biological systems. Here we present the first interface that can be electrically switched between a high&#8208;capacity (&gt;1 &#956;g/cm  2  ) multilayer protein binding state and a completely non&#8208;fouling state (no detectable adsorption). Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Extended Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Derivatives with Very Low&#8208;Lying Triplet States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell non&#8208;alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are attracting increasing attention due to their promising applications in organic spintronics and quantum computing. Herein we report the synthesis of three cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based diradicaloids (  1&#8208;3  ), by fusion of benzo rings on its periphery for the thermodynamic stabilization, as evidenced by multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, all of them display a very narrow optical energy gap (  E  g  opt  = 0.52&#8208;0.69 eV) and persistent stability under ambient conditions (  t  1/2  = 11.7&#8208;33.3 h). More importantly, this new type of diradicaloids possess a low&#8208;lying triplet state with an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, as low as 0.002 kcal/mol, with a clear dependence on the molecular size. This family of compounds thus offers a new route to create non&#8208;alternant open&#8208;shell PHs with high&#8208;spin ground states, and opens up novel possibilities and insights into understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO  2  reduction to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over copper based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. Herein, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations, this paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic copper zinc nanoparticles models and investigates the atom&#8208;level structure of C  2+  products active sites on CuZn catalysts in CO  2  ER. After analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8208;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8208;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8208;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental results. This work provides a new research paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfiguration and Reorganization of Bottlebrush Polymer Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic&#8208; and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by in&#8208;plane diffusion (rhs).







Abstract
Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy. Both the degree of polymerization (NBB) and extent of grafting in these BRCPs were found to impact surface coverage and assembly kinetics. The time&#8208;dependence of the interfacial tension is described as the sum of two exponential relaxation functions characterizing BRCP diffusion, interfacial adsorption, and reorganization. Interfacial tension (&#947;) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results showed that higher molecular weight BRCPs require longer time to adsorb to the water&#8211;oil interface, but less time for interfacial reorganization. Overall, this work describes fundamental principles of BRCP assembly at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, with implications pertaining to polymer design with enhanced understanding of emulsification, adhesion, and related properties in fluids and at interfaces.

         <title>Spatially Resolved, Error&#8208;Robust Multiplexed MicroRNA Profiling in Single Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;encoded error&#8208;corrected label (FluoEL) for multiplexed microRNA imaging in living cells is developed. Proportionally encoded Cy3 and Cy5 overcome the limitation of spectral overlap. The core&#8211;shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) structure avoids FRET between the recognition component of the molecular beacon (MB) and the barcoding dye to provide high accuracy.







Abstract
Simultaneous imaging of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in individual living cells is challenging due to the lack of spectrally distinct encoded fluorophores and non&#8208;cytotoxic methods. We describe a multiplexed error&#8208;robust combinatorial fluorescent label&#8208;encoding method, termed fluorophores encoded error&#8208;corrected labels (FluoELs), enabling multiplexed miRNA imaging in living cells with error&#8208;correcting capability. The FluoELs comprise proportional dual fluorophores for encoding and a constant quantitative single fluorophore for error&#8208;corrected quantification. Both are embedded in 260&#8197;nm core&#8211;shell silica nanoparticles modified with molecular beacon detection probes. The FluoELs are low cytotoxic and could accurately quantify and spatially resolve nine breast&#8208;cancer&#8208;related miRNAs and evaluate their coordination. The FluoELs enabled a single&#8208;cell analysis platform to evaluate miRNA expression profiles and the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Designing a Network of Crystalline Polymers for a Scalable, Nonfluorinated, Healable and Amphiphobic Solid Slippery Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate&#8208;independent polymeric coating to develop a non&#8208;fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
The fluorinated&#8208;liquid infused amphiphobic slippery interfaces exhibiting superior sliding of the beaded oil/water droplets, often suffer from durability and contamination issues. Here, the ability of 1)&#8197;hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon sides in a selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer and 2)&#8197;its reversible phase transition at 51&#8201;&#176;C was rationally exploited to achieve temperature&#8208;assisted rapid (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitive (50 times) self&#8208;healable amphiphobic solid&#8208;slippery coating on both planar and geometrically&#8208;complex substrates. The selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer was strategically infused in a porous, hydrophilic and thick (&#8776;4.8&#8197;&#956;m) polymeric coating. The resultant solid and smooth interface exhibited sliding of beaded droplets of various liquids, including droplets of water, polar (ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;hexanol, DMSO, DMF), and non&#8208;polar (decane, dodecane, diiodomethane) organic solvents, edible (vegetable oil), motor, engine (petrol, diesel, kerosene) and crude oils.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delivery system which can release pure H2S, hydrogen persulfide, and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide was used to compare the pharmacological difference of sulfide and persulfide. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.







Abstract
Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug. In particular, the H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Electrophile Synthesis of Di(hetero)arylmethanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfinative C&#8722;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzylic halides and heteroaryl halides are directly coupled using Pd&#8208;catalysis and a simple sulfinate transfer reagent. The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.







Abstract
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of simple imide&#8208;directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six&#8208;membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.

         <title>Activation of CO Using a 1,2&#8208;Disilylene: Facile Synthesis of an Abnormal N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a 1,2&#8208;disilylene with CO under ambient conditions leads to a bis(silylene), the five&#8208;membered heterocycle of which represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (see picture). Reactions of the bis(silylene) with transition metal carbonyls lead to different outcomes, including a chelate complex of the Mo(CO)4 fragment.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylene, [{ArC(NDip)2}Si]2 1 (Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But), with CO proceeds via insertion of CO into one Si&#8722;N bond, and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage, to cleanly give the bis(silylene), {ArC(NDip)2}Si(:)O
 Ar 2, under ambient conditions. The reaction can be partially reversed when solutions of 2 are subjected to UV irradiation. The five&#8208;membered heterocyclic fragment of 2 represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC), a view which is substantiated by a computational analysis of the compound. Reaction of 2 with [Mo(CO)6] under UV light affords the chelate complex, [Mo(CO)4(&#954;2&#8208;Si,Si&#8208;2)] 3, while reaction with [Fe(CO)5] gives the unusual silyleneyl bridged complex, [{Fe2(CO)6}{&#956;&#8208;Si[(NDip)2CAr]}2] 4. The same coordination complexes can be accessed by reaction of 1 with [Mo(CO)6] or [Fe(CO)5] under UV light. As is the case for aNHCs, d&#8208;block metal complexes of bis(silylene) 2 could prove useful as bespoke catalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Based Complex Fluids as Aqueous Exciton Transport Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions are fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. Complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid in which energy transfer is highly efficient.







Abstract
The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate shape evolution is proposed. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories of NPs. The theory accommodates the conventional theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.

         <title>Overcoming Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general tetrazine probe design strategy overcomes the spectral dependence of the energy transfer mechanism, endowing excellent fluorogenicity in the NIR window. The high specificity, signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and photostability of the synthesized probes make them highly suited for live&#8208;cell bioimaging and theranostics.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we report a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct ultra&#8208;fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the meso&#8208;positions of various far&#8208;red and NIR fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (102&#8211;103&#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806&#8197;nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel donor&#8208;pillar[5]arene&#8208;acceptor structure with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property shows a twisted conformation and intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). Balancing of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission via viscosity and polar guest generates the single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed peri&#8208;Selective Direct Alkenylations with Weak O&#8208;Coordination Enabled by the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation&#8208;sensitive 1&#8208;naphthols as well as 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity, with molecular H2 as the only stoichiometric waste product.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp2)&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative peri C&#8722;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis via user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies That Accelerate Their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;structural feedback mechanism is introduced in co&#8208;assembling microgels (MGs), whereby the co&#8208;assemblies promote their own destruction. The key concept uses co&#8208;assembly&#8208;triggered proximity effects of enzymes immobilized on individual MGs so that the co&#8208;assembly enhances an enzymatic cascade for deactivator production.







Abstract
Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between E,E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.







Abstract
The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a Hypericum plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.

Low&#8208;valent zirconocene&#8208;mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Rosenthal's&#8208;reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), 6, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 6 and benzdiyne gave adducts 14, 15&#8201;a, and 15&#8201;b along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel 13. Stepwise routes using 14 or 15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of 13 as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for 13 was revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Low-valent zirconocene-mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;-dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3-butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.

&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal's-reagent-mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;-dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3-butadiene-embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts.

         <title>Endo&#8208;M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To selectively enrich O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N&#8208;glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. Compared with the classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag&#8208;free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.</dc:description>
