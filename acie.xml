         <title>Enhancing C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of Glycerol Electrooxidation through Spin&#8208;selective Electron Donation in&#160;Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox Heterostructural Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a 4d&#8211;transition metal, the spin state of Pd is extremely difficult to directly regulate for the optimized d orbital states owing to the strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect and further extended d orbital. Herein, we devise "spin&#8211;selective electron donation" strategy to tune specific d orbital electrons of Pd inspired by Dewar&#8722;Chatt&#8722;Duncanson model theory. Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridges with different spin&#8211;states of CoIII have been constructed in a series of Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Cox HNSs with tunable Co content. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that low&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g6eg0) with fully occupied t2g orbitals and empty dz2 orbital can accurately alter the dz2 electron of Pd by &#963;&#8211;donation via Co&#8722;S&#8722;Pd bridge. In contrast, unfilled dxy orbital of high&#8208;spin CoIII (t2g5eg1) is essential for controlling the dxy electron of Pd via &#960;&#8211;donation. Benefiting from dz2 state optimization by &#963;&#8211;donation, Pd&#8211;PdS2&#8211;Co4.0 delivers superior performance towards various bio&#8211;alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) with enhanced C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, coupling glycerol oxidation reaction with CO2 reduction reaction (GOR||CO2RR), the electricity consumption of GOR||CO2RR drops 46.4% compared to the state&#8722;of&#8722;art system (OER||CO2RR). Moreover, anodic Faraday efficiency (FE) of formic acid can be attainable more than 90% at low voltage region.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Interlayer Binding to Ordered &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Units for Constructing High&#8208;Performing Light Polarization Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The light polarization modulation involves the capacity to respond selectively to light&#8208;mater interaction and is dependent on the optical anisotropy of crystalline materials. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated component is almost typically utilized to produce such materials in the short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region, however, the conflicting link between high optical anisotropy and strong layered habit is difficult to reconcile. As a result, many anisotropic crystals are limited to tiny crystals rather than processing optical devices. This study designs crystals with beneficial but easy&#8208;to&#8208;grow layered structure and strong optical anisotropy by bridging the interlayer binding to ordered &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. To this end, two new hybrid crystals&#160;are reported by combining cationic regulation and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. &#160;This allows for the easy growth of centimeter&#8208;large, high optical quality 1Na single crystals, providing crystal assurance for all&#8208;around testing for a practical crystal. Using the most accurate minimal deviation angle method, the birefringence is measured to be 0.174&#8208;0.258@253&#8208;1013 nm, surpassing all reported crystals with the same components of [HCOO] or [C(NH2)3] in the applied short&#8208;wave ultraviolet region as well as the corresponding commercial crystals. This work will serve as a guide for future research on innovative short&#8208;wave ultraviolet birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Transformation in Lanthanum Nickelate for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;based perovskite oxides are identified as promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in view of their low cost, highly tunable structure, and potential high activity. However, the performance and catalyst design are hindered by their sluggish surface reconstruction kinetics. We introduce a ferric ion pre&#8208;etching strategy to enhance the surface reconstruction of typical LaNiO3. The hydrolysis of ferric ions generates hydrated protons that corrode the La&#8208;O terminal sites, inducing lattice distortion and lowering the energy barrier for reconstruction. Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low&#8208;activity LaNiO3 to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO2 and NiFe LDHs. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal substantial surface transformation from corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing NiO6 at 1.43 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in the surface pre&#8208;etched sample (LNFe&#8546;&#8208;spe). This reconstruction is initiated by the lattice oxygen mechanism and transitions to the adsorbate evolution mechanism, underscoring the transformation of distinct OER mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinative Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Limonene Carbamate towards Phosgene&#8208; and Isocyanate&#8208;Free Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a phosgene&#8208; and isocyanate&#8208;free route for the synthesis of polyurethanes using (R)&#8208;limonene as a bio&#8208;based starting material. The synthesis of the cyclic limonene&#8208;based carbamate monomer&#160;LU&#160;is achieved in high yields using dimethyl carbonate as a sustainable, less hazardous phosgene surrogate and is verified by NMR, SC&#8208;XRD, ESI&#8208;MS, GC&#8208;MS, and elemental analysis. Polymerizations were carried out by coordinative ring&#8208;opening polymerization. Sn(Oct)2showed the best catalytic performance, achieving up to 93% conversion with molecular weights up to 16.0&#160;kg/mol at a polydispersity of 1.5. Detailed mechanistic insights were obtained by kinetic studies, end group determination&#160;via&#160;ESI&#8208;MS and stoichiometric ninhydrin experiments,&#160;N&#8208;H&#160;methylation of&#160;LU,&#160;kinetic isotope experiments,&#160;and&#160;119Sn&#160;NMR measurements. The resulting semi&#8208;crystalline polyurethane exhibits promising thermal properties, including a decomposition temperature of 252&#160;&#176;C, and a glass transition temperature above 150&#160;&#176;C. Depolymerization in solution was achieved in high yield using the same catalyst. This work describes a coordinative ring&#8208;opening polymerization approach using a terpene&#8208;based carbamate as monomer, an important step towards bio&#8208;based polyurethanes.</dc:description>

         <title>closo&#8208;Carboranyl Analogs of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines: Direct Synthesis from Alkenes via EnT&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>closo&#8208;Carboranes are icosahedral carbon&#8208;boron clusters with unique properties and broad applicability. They particularly stand out in the context of drug development as privileged structural motifs for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and as highly hydrophobic bioisosteres for the rotational volume of phenyl rings. Herein, we unveil the synthesis of N&#8208;protected carboranyl analogs of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines &#8211; widely found structural motifs in biologically active molecules &#8211; via a one&#8208;step alkene difunctionalization approach. Key for our success were the enabling mechanistic characteristics of energy transfer catalysis which we used for the first time to generate carboranyl radicals. Downstream modifications gave a series of analogs of amino acids and known N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphodiester groups occur ubiquitously in nature, e.g. in nucleic acids or in cyclic (di&#8208;)nucleotides important for signal transduction. Proteins often use polar or positively charged amino acids to interact with the negatively charged phosphodiester groups via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. In contrast, the acidic amino acids aspartate and glutamate are generally not considered as important determinants for phosphodiester group recognition. Instead they are regarded as detrimental to such interactions due to the assumed charge repulsion between their deprotonated, negatively charged side chain carboxylate groups and the phosphodiester. Accordingly, acidic amino acids are often purposefully introduced into proteins to abrogate nucleic acid interactions in functional studies. Here, we show that in appropriate structural contexts glutamate side chains are readily protonated even at neutral pH and act as hydrogen bond donors to phosphodiester groups using a c&#8208;di&#8208;GMP binding protein &#8211; the GSPII&#8208;B domain of PilF from Thermus thermophilus &#8211; as an example. Surveying available RNA&#8208;protein and DNA&#8208;protein complex structures in the PDB, we found that hydrogen bonds between protonated carboxylate groups of glutamate and aspartate and phosphodiester groups occur frequently in different functional protein classes. Thus, the functional role of acidic amino acids in phosphodiester group recognition needs to be re&#8208;evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Photoinitiators for High&#8208;Efficiency Visible LED and Sunlight Polymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the development and evaluation of five dyes with varying conjugated energy levels and donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structures as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Their photoinitiation efficiencies are systematically assessed under both visible&#8208;light LED and sunlight. Notably, the conversions reach up to 81% within just 30 s under sunlight, demonstrating the ultra&#8208;fast and efficient polymerization capabilities of the dyes. The efficient electron transfer is facilitated by the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, where the conjugation is reduced or interrupted by the high distortion between the electron&#8208;withdrawing and the electron&#8208;releasing units. This distortion can prevent the overlap of frontier molecular orbitals, decreasing the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of dyes, thereby enhancing the electron transfer reactivity with additives. Additionally, we propose a chemical mechanism for the electron transfer reaction in the three&#8208;component systems. The study also explores the application of naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione&#8208;based dyes as donors in additive manufacturing demonstrating their effectiveness in three different 3D printing technologies, i.e. direct laser writing (DLW), digital light processing (DLP), and liquid crystal display (LCD). These three&#8208;component formulations achieve high&#8208;precision 3D printed objects, with detailed characterization and comparison of the resulting structures.</dc:description>

         <title>In Quest of Chemical Probes for DNA Methylation Reader Proteins: Nucleoside and Dimer Analogues of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine Interact with MBD2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA methylation modulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns characterise a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, and serve as validated therapeutic targets and diagnostic tools. Among the proteins involved in DNA methylation regulation, the human reader Methyl&#8208;CpG Binding Domain 2 protein (MBD2) exhibits a strong preference for methylated DNA and initiates signalling cascades predominantly resulting in gene repression. The full description of this mechanism is still to be elucidated. Here, we developed original chemical compounds to interfere with MBD2 and its interaction with DNA.
Through convergent chemical pathways, we modified 5&#8208;methylcytosine at position N4 and synthesised the corresponding deoxynucleosides and CpG dimers. We tested 70 compounds in two screening assays to assess their interaction with MBD2 and their ability to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex. Remarkably, substituting modified nucleobases into CpG dimers significantly boosted the biological activity.
Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the configuration (D/L) of the modified nucleosides and identified four dimers (5d, 7e, 15e and 16e) able to disrupt the MBD2/DNA complex, highlighting the advantage of the L&#8208;configuration. Importantly, NMR experiments confirmed their interaction with amino acids of MBD2 involved in methylated DNA binding.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Membrane Supramolecular Assemblies Serving as Bioorthogonal Gating for Melphalan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent drugs have experienced a revival in recent decades due to their advantageous pharmacodynamic profiles and targeting of &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins. However, balancing selectivity, reactivity, and potency is essential for the safe and effective drugs. Here we employ a cell&#8208;selective bioorthogonal prodrug design to enhance the selectivity for covalent inhibitors without compromising the reactivity and potency. The upregulation of phosphatase and integrin facilitates the formation of enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular assemblies (EISA) on cancer cell membrane. These assemblies localize bioorthogonal reaction handles tetrazine (Tz) which liberate Melphalan from its bioorthogonal prodrug TCO&#8208;Mel. The TCO modification disrupts the LAT1 mediated transportation, reducing cellular permeability of TCO&#8208;Mel and the corresponding cytotoxicity to normal cells. While the cell&#8208;selective on&#8208;membrane assemblies directed prodrug activation restores Melphalan influx to inhibit cancer cell growth. This prodrug activation strategy further demonstrates potent tumor suppression with satisfactory biocompatibility in vivo. Overall, we extend the scope of bioorthogonal prodrug design for covalent drugs via regulating cellular influx of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Peptide Probes for Immunomodulatory Protein CD59: Potent Modulators of Bacterial Toxin Activity and Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CD59 is an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Despite its importance in complement regulation and bacterial pathogenesis, CD59 remains a challenging therapeutic target. Research to date has focused on antibody or protein&#8208;based strategies. Here we present a new approach to target CD59 using macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59. Through X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies we identify key interactions which are essential for binding and activity. We find that the macrocyclic peptide CP&#8208;06 adopts a beta&#8208;hairpin structure and binds CD59 through an intermolecular beta&#8208;sheet, mimicking protein&#8208;protein interactions of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. We create dimeric and lipidated macrocyclic peptide conjugates as enhanced cell&#8208;active CD59 inhibitors and show that these probes can be used to modulate both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors. Together, our data provide a starting point for future development of macrocyclic peptides to target CD59 activity in diverse cellular contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Metal&#8208;Free Peroxidase Designed Using a Ferritin Cage for Bioinspired Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial enzymes is challenging because it requires precise design of active sites with well&#8208;arranged amino acid residues. Histidine&#8208;rich oligopeptides have been recently shown to exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities, but their catalytic function relies on maintaining unique supramolecular structures. This work demonstrates the design of a specific array of histidine residues on the internal surface of the ferritin cage to function as an active center for catalysis. The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine&#8208;histidine interactions, forming well&#8208;defined histidine clusters (His&#8208;clusters). These mutants exhibit peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activities by oxidizing 3,3&#8217;,5, 5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co&#8208;localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine&#8208;rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions. This study presents a simple yet effective approach to design metal&#8208;free artificial enzymes, paving the way for innovations in bioinspired catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Assembled from {Ni6} Nodes for Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing cluster&#8208;based nodes and using them as catalytic sites can bring new structure and function for metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs). However, successful examples are very limited. Herein, we found that a 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (Hmmt) based {Ni6} subunit is robust in building such MOCs.

Interestingly, MOCs  4&#8208;6  can uptake CO2 in solid states. Moreover, they can effectively and selectively convert CO2 into CO under visible light owing to the active wing Ni(II) ions which are ancillarily coordinated with solvent molecules. All of them show turnover frequencies larger than 3500 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and selectivity higher than 90%. This is a much higher performance compared to the usage of cage space for CO2 reduction in previously reported MOCs and competitive to most Ni(II)&#8208;based simple coordination complexes. As such, this work may open a new paradigm for designing node based catalytic function for MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an Organoautocatalyzed Double &#963;&#8208;Bond C(sp2)&#8208;N Transamination Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transamination reaction, which involves the conversion of one amine to another, traditionally relies on biological enzyme catalysts. Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal&#8208;catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)&#8211;N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)&#8211;N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives. The reaction mechanism has been studied in detail through time&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;NMR, 2D NMR, and computational methods. Remarkably, in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt acts as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) organoautocatalyst in this multi&#8208;step domino process. The new organoautocatalyzed methodology gives environmentally friendly, atom&#8208;economical, straightforward, and rapid access to N&#8208;substituted 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DNDHPs), thus offering facile entry to privileged bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carboxylate&#8208;based Hydrophilic Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with a Large Molecular Dipole Moment for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate&#8208;based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor&#8208;water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10&#8208;fold. This induces a giant built&#8208;in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM&#8208;based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, four times over the ester&#8208;based counterpart (PTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100 h operation. This result places it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction photocatalysts in terms of stability. This work establishes a molecular engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction photocatalysts, emphasizing synergistic optimization of hydrophilicity, dipole engineering, and interfacial dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Highly Reversible Four&#8208;Electron Redox of S/Cu2S for Aqueous Zn/S&#9472;Cu Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the regulation of spatial&#8208;confinement carbon (SC&#8208;C), the oxidation sequence of CuI and S2&#8722; in Cu2S was changed (from path I to path II), and the formation of irreversible intermediate CuS was inhibited, thus achieving a stable one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion between S &#8596; Cu2S. 








Abstract
The combination of sulfur (S) cathode with Cu2+/Cu+ redox carriers has been considered as a promising cathode for the next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage device due to the high specific capacity (two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion), intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory cycling stability of a sulfur&#8211;copper (S&#8211;Cu) cathode hinders its practical application. Herein, the two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversions are first decoupled in our study, identifying the inferior conversion reversibility between the intermedia CuS and the final product S as the primary cause for deteriorating cycling capability. Concerning the different hydrated dimensions of the Cu(H2O)62+ and Cu(H2O)2+, the strategy of &#8220;spatial confinement&#8221; is proposed to alter the oxidation path of Cu2S and prevent the formation of the intermedia CuS. To ensure efficient S incorporation into the spatially confined carbon matrix, selenium (Se) is employed to &#8220;cut&#8221; the S8 into short&#8208;chain molecules. Consequently, the well&#8208;designed S&#8211;Cu cathode achieves a one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron reaction and exhibits superior electrochemical stability with an average capacity attenuation of 0.034% during 700 cycles. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the conversion mechanism for the S&#8211;Cu cathode within the spatial&#8208;confinement environment and renders valuable insights for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type cathodes in aqueous energy&#8208;storage device.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Total Syntheses of Cycloaurenones and Dysiherbols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols via a common cyclohexadienone intermediate, that is, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition reaction. This cyclohexadienone was obtained by a bidirectional synthesis from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide, with stereocenters set by a novel Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% e.e.).








Abstract
Cycloaurenones and dysiherbols are naturally occurring sesquiterpene quinones/quinols that share a 6/6/5/6 tetracyclic carbon skeleton with either a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;decalin system containing four contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Total syntheses of cycloaurenones have not been reported. Herein, we present the first enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols based on manipulation of a common cyclohexadienone intermediate: namely, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization for cycloaurenones and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition for dysiherbols. Moreover, the key cyclohexadienone intermediate was readily accessible by a bidirectional approach from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide. The 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters were installed by an unprecedented enantioselective hydrogenation of the corresponding bis&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Weinreb amide (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).

         <title>Multivariate Distribution Structured Anisotropic Inorganic Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Cycle and High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with multivariate distribution anisotropic structure was developed. Parts of the vermiculite sheets suspended among the PVDF matrix facilitate lithium salts dissociation and form fast Li+ transport channels. Other parts of vermiculite sheets tiled on electrolyte surface generate dense and high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, improving the interfacial kinetics and suppressing the dendrite growth.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries owing to their favorable rheological properties and interfacial compatibility with cathodes and Li anodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity and low modulus lead to inferior electrochemical performance and dendrite growth. Herein, we developed a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte comprising vermiculite sheets and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with multivariate distribution and an anisotropic structure. Within this assembly, some vermiculite sheets were suspended in the PVDF matrix to facilitate Li salt dissociation and Li+ transport, while others were tiled on the electrolyte surface, generating a dense, high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase via in situ electrochemical reduction, which further improved interfacial kinetics and suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, a high conductivity of 1.38&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 was achieved at room temperature, and the Li||Li cells displayed robust stability over 3000&#160;h. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||Li full cells delivered a specific capacity of 172&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5&#160;C. Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks Mediated by Redox&#8208;Responsive Neighboring&#8208;Group&#8208;Participating Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) effect of selenium&#8208;bridged bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane bis&#8208;alkyl halide (Se&#8208;BCN) demonstrates great potential as a crosslinker for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. The activity of selenium&#8208;based NGP can be regulated by oxidation and reduction of the selenium atom, thus allowing the dynamic performance of such crosslinked networks to be controlled through redox response.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) typically require external catalysts to facilitate efficient crosslinker exchange, which can limit the reprocessability of the network due to leaching and degradation of the catalyst. In this study, the use of catalysts was avoided by employing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (BCN) bis&#8208;alkyl halide crosslinker with selenium&#8208;based neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;participation (NGP) to enhance the rate of bond exchange. This thermally mediated C&#9472;N alkyl exchange and the associated flow behavior enabled the intrinsically ionic network (which possesses antimicrobial properties) to be both chemically recycled and repaired and reprocessed under mild conditions. Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the network can be regulated by the reversible redox responsiveness of selenium atoms within the network. This novel type of NGP&#8208;based CAN therefore has the potential to enrich designs for catalyst&#8208;free dynamic networks with high performance and modulated dynamicity.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Radical Alkylation by Synergistic Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Enzyme and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalytic radical alkylation of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles is achieved through the cross&#8208;integration of a Lewis&#8208;acid (LA)&#8208;type artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) and a photobiocatalysis strategy. Directed evolution leads to enantiodivergent synthesis with different mutants. Detailed mechanistic studies illustrate a difference in reactivity and enantiomeric preference between the illuminated and dark conditions.








Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) and photoenzymatic catalysis represent two cutting&#8208;edge approaches to creating new enzyme reactivity. However, the potential of merging these two strategies remains underdeveloped for enantiocontrolled biotransformations. Herein, we develop a synergistic metalloenzymatic and photoredox catalysis platform to enable enantiodivergent radical alkylation of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Specifically, cupin proteins are redesigned to function as copper(II)&#8208;based Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;enzymes (LAses), which, in synergy with tripyridinyl&#8208;ruthenium&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, precisely control the generation, reactivity, and selectivity of abiological radicals, thereby unlocking non&#8208;natural enzyme reactivity. Powered by protein engineering, repurposed photo&#8208;LAses facilitate the green and efficient synthesis of diverse enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in high enantioselectivity (both enantiomers accessible, up to 97% yield and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio [er]). Detailed mechanistic studies suggest a radical addition to the metalloenzymatic enolate pathway and explain the switched selectivity from dark to photoconditions.

         <dc:description>
Electrochemically charging colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) enables the study of the intrinsic multi&#8208;carrier dynamics in quantum dots (QDs) by in situ ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, revealing the spin blockade effect and phonon bottleneck effect for hot electron cooling and allowing mechanism studies of charged QDs in various applications.








Abstract
The application of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysis inevitably involves them in charged states. The carrier and exciton dynamics of electrochemically charged NCs in solutions have yet to be reported. Herein, the electrochemical charging effects in colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) are systematically investigated using static spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) and in situ transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Static SEC reveals the presence of in&#8208;gap trap states from 0.9&#160;eV below the conduction band (CB) edge. Negligible changes in TA spectra and kinetics were observed from open circuit potential (OCP) to more anodic potentials within the QD band gap. At cathodic potentials, the negatively charged QDs show band edge trion decay with a lifetime of 690&#160;&#177;&#160;31&#160;ps and slower 1P to 1S electron relaxation with time constants of 12.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8&#160;ps assigned to the spin blockade effect and 316&#160;&#177;&#160;35&#160;ps assigned to the phonon bottleneck effect. Our study reveals rich effects of charging on QD excited state under nearly native conditions.

         <title>Altering the Symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C by Axial Cl&#8208;Mediation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy to alter the symmetry of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration via axial coordination of chlorine atoms to FePc molecules on CNTs matrix. The elongated Fe&#9472;N bonds and the transformation of Fe&#9472;N4 symmetry (from D4h to C4v) mitigate the dissolution of Fe centers, by which it allows to lower the ORR overpotential, optimize *OH desorption, and suppress harmful molecule adsorption, substantially improving ORR activity and the stability in zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a &#8220;Cl&#8208;mediation&#8221; strategy is proposed on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure toward achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl&#8208;modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C (FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc&#8208;CNTs (0.88&#160;V versus RHE). The advanced nature of the as&#8208;prepared FePc&#8208;Cl&#8208;CNTs is evidenced by a configured high&#8208;performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, which operates stably for over 150&#160;h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D4h to C4v symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe&#8208;center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration.

The elongated Fe&#9472;N bonds and the transformation of Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry (from D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt;) mitigate the dissolution of Fe centers, by which it allows to lower the ORR overpotential, optimize *OH desorption, and suppress harmful molecule adsorption, substantially improving ORR activity and the stability in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is acknowledged as a promising alternative for the state-of-the-art Pt/C in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward cutting-edge electrochemical energy conversion/storage applications. Herein, a &#8220;Cl-mediation&#8221; strategy is proposed on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C for modulating the catalyst's electronic structure toward achieving remarkable ORR activity. By coordinating axial Cl atoms to iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) matrix, a Cl-modulated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C (FePc-Cl-CNTs) catalyst is synthesized. The as-prepared FePc-Cl-CNTs exhibit an improved ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.91&#160;V versus RHE in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the parent FePc-CNTs (0.88&#160;V versus RHE). The advanced nature of the as-prepared FePc-Cl-CNTs is evidenced by a configured high-performance rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, which operates stably for over 150&#160;h. The experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil that axial Cl atoms induce the transformation of FePc from its original D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, effectively altering the electrons distribution around the Fe-center, by which it optimizes *OH desorption and subsequently boosts the reaction kinetics. This work paves ways for resolving the dilemma of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts&#8217; exploration via engineering Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benchmark Paraffin Adsorption in a Super&#8208;Hydrophobic Porous Coordination Polymer with Blade&#8208;Like Circular Phenyl Nanotraps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;hydrophobic porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) with blade&#8208;like circular phenyl nanotraps was designed to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of paraffin/olefin separation under humid conditions. The confined nonpolar environment enables record&#8208;high uptake of C3H8 and C2H6 at low pressures, exceptional selectivity over olefins, and high productivity of polymer&#8208;grade olefins in breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Selective capture of paraffin from olefin that permits one&#8208;step purification of olefin is significantly important, yet developing adsorbents with high selectivity and hydrophobicity remains a daunting challenge. Although aromatic environments can enhance paraffin affinity and hydrophobicity through nonpolar interactions, water adsorption still occurs in regions distant from the aromatic rings, as well as in secondary pores that are always overlooked. Herein, we reported an ultramicroporous porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) featuring blade&#8208;like circular phenyl paraffin nanotraps. As further validated by density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and in situ Fourier&#8208;tansform infrared absorption (FT&#8208;IR) analysis, these ultramicroporous paraffin nanotraps created by surrounding benzene rings enhance the paraffin&#8208;selective adsorption, and the segmented spaces between adjacent nanotraps in the blade&#8208;like structure, combined with hydrophobic petal&#8208;like secondary pore channels enclosed by fluorinated functional groups, further mitigate the water co&#8208;adsorption. Remarkably, ZnFPCP exhibited outstanding ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) selectivity (C3H8/C3H6: 2.08, C2H6/C2H4: 2.93) under ambient conditions and record&#8208;breaking C3H8/C2H6 uptake at low pressures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated the excellent performance of ZnFPCP in olefin purification, affording the exceptional productivity of ultra&#8208;high purity (99.99%) for C3H6 and C2H4. Robust stability and super hydrophobicity highlight its potential in harsh industrial application scenarios.

         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of chemically self&#8208;charging mechanisms and the recent progress in the design of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. The challenges and future prospects are also discussed for chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. This review offers insight into potential future directions in the design of innovative chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries are regarded as potential candidates for off&#8208;grid energy storage devices due to their environmental independence and simple construction. Although tremendous research efforts have been recently made to design chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries, a comprehensive review about them is still absent. This review describes the design principles of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries and their self&#8208;charging mechanism. The advances in their cathode materials mainly include transition&#8208;metal oxides or sulfides, Prussian blue analogues, and organic compounds. Subsequently, the strategies of enhancing chemically self&#8208;charging kinetics are highlighted, including the design of materials, selection of oxidants, and the introduction of catalysts. In addition, various applications of chemically self&#8208;charging batteries are also discussed in wearable electronic devices, low temperatures, and all&#8208;pH scenarios. In the final section, the challenges and future perspectives are presented for designing high&#8208;performance chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries. It will shed light on the R&amp;D of chemically self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries.

         <title>Temporary Structural Supports for Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protecting groups to accomplish regioselectivity in synthesis by temporarily shielding functional groups that would otherwise react are indispensable in organic chemistry. Recently the analogous importance of temporary groups for the synthesis of biomacromolecules, especially proteins, has been recognized to solve the problems due to poor solution behavior of synthetic protein intermediates. 








Abstract
The range of functional proteins that can be prepared by chemical protein synthesis includes those bearing complex modifications and incorporating d&#8208;amino acids, and exceeds what can be accessed by biological means, but the technique is still limited by the unfavorable solution behavior of many synthetic protein intermediates in buffer, leading to inefficient ligation, purification, and in vitro folding. One approach to address this limitation is the use of temporary structural supports&#8212;chemical modifications, usually solubilizing functionalities such as polyamines or carbohydrates&#8212;that are installed on either the backbone or side chains of the synthetic protein intermediates and removed at a later stage of chemical protein synthesis. The basic processes for introducing and removing such temporary structural supports are reminiscent of the canonical protecting groups ubiquitous in organic chemistry. However, unlike the synthesis of small organic molecules, where solubility is rarely an issue, the purpose of temporary structural supports is to modulate the solution behavior of the synthetic protein intermediates to prevent them from aggregation, precipitation, or retention in unfavorable solvation&#8208;phase conformations. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of temporary structural supports for chemical protein synthesis and organize them into three categories: 1) Temporary structural supports to improve solubility; 2) Temporary structural supports to assist chemical ligation; and 3) Temporary structural supports to promote in vitro folding.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Richest Molecular Complex: Ligand&#8208;Length Facilitated Cu40H38 Nanoclusters Exhibiting High Catalytic Performance for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two copper hydride clusters, Cu40H38 and Cu18H16, with similar structures but different sizes, are reported. Cu40H38, achieved by ligand&#8208;length modulation, records the highest hydride content and metal&#8208;ligand ratio among copper hydride clusters. Its high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio increasing naked copper atoms on the surface enhance catalytic activity for the selective reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, offering new avenues for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Copper hydride clusters are extensively studied for their significant potential catalysis. Although clusters with a high hydride content are particularly intriguing, they present considerable synthetic challenges. Herein, we report two copper hydride clusters, Cu18H16 and Cu40H38, which exhibit similar layered structures and components, albeit differing in size. The larger&#8208;sized Cu40H38 with more hydrides was achieved through ligand&#8208;length modulation by replacing 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) in the synthesis of Cu18H16 with 1,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane (dpppe). Cu40H38 is remarkable for i) the highest number of hydrides among known molecular compounds, ii) the highest number of unligated copper atoms and the highest metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in copper hydride clusters. Moreover, catalytic studies on the selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds demonstrate that Cu40H38 is a promising catalyst and provide clear structural evidence that a less sterically hindered cluster surface, with a high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio, is beneficial for high&#8208;performance catalysis. The findings highlight the importance of surface composition and ligand coverage in catalytic efficiency and offer new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance copper hydride cluster catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion Efficiency by Promoting the Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Pathway via Modulating the Main Electron Transition Orbital</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers, featuring precisely positioned triazine acceptors at the 2,7 positions of pyrene donors, regulated electron transitions from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital, enabling efficient two&#8208;electron water oxidation reactions (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production, with high yields and impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiencies.








Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production involves coupling oxygen reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions. However, the low efficiency of water oxidation constrains the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen peroxide conversion efficiency under natural conditions. The two&#8208;electron water oxidation pathway holds potential for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, yet its regulatory mechanisms and detailed understanding remain inadequately explored. Herein, we construct donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers with pyrene as the electron donor and triazine as the electron acceptor. By optimizing the connecting positions of the electron acceptors at the 2,7 positions of the electron donors, the main excited state is regulated from S1 to S2, leading to the electron transition from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital. This modulation effectively enhances the oxidation capacity of the photocatalyst, enabling it to undergo two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production. Consequently, the WOR activity reaches a remarkable efficiency of 2560&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, corresponding to a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of up to 0.94%. This strategy of modulating electronic transition orbitals to enhance the water oxidation capacity of the material significantly improves photocatalytic performance and facilitates its application in natural environments.

         <title>Integrating Ambient Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Spatial Transcriptomics on the Same Cancer Tissues to Identify RNA&#8211;Metabolite Correlations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovations in spatial omics have advanced disease research, but spatial transcriptomics (ST) and spatial metabolomics remain separate. We present a novel method integrating DESI&#8208;MSI spatial metabolomics and Visium&#8208;ST on the same tissue sections while preserving RNA quality and data integrity. Applied to breast and lung cancer tissue, this approach reveals new metabolite&#8208;transcript correlations in cancer regions, enhancing spatial multi&#8208;omics discoveries. 








Abstract
Innovations in spatial omics technologies applied to human tissues have led to breakthrough discoveries in various diseases, including cancer. Two of these approaches&#8212;spatial transcriptomics and spatial metabolomics&#8212;have blossomed independently, fueled by technologies such as spatial transcriptomics (ST) and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Although powerful, these technologies only offer insights into the spatial distributions of restricted classes of molecules and have not yet been integrated to provide more holistic insights into biological questions. These techniques can be performed on adjacent serial sections from the same sample, but section&#8208;to&#8208;section variability can convolute data integration. We present a novel method combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI&#8208;MSI) spatial metabolomics and Visium spatial transcriptomics on the same tissue sections. We show that RNA quality is maintained after performing DESI&#8208;MSI on a tissue under ambient conditions and that ST data is unperturbed following DESI&#8208;MSI. We demonstrate this workflow on human breast and lung cancer tissues and identify novel correlations between metabolites and mRNA transcripts in cancer&#8208;specific tissue regions.

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Acid Strategy for Corrosion&#8208;Free Proton Storage: Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte Engineering Toward Sustainable Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;acid electrolyte enables ultra&#8208;stable aqueous proton storage by synergistically enhancing proton activity and transport kinetics while effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions and electrode dissolution. 








Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of protons such as minimal hydrated radius, natural abundance, and rapid transport kinetics, have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, conventional strong acid electrolytes like H2SO4 suffer from critical limitations including electrode dissolution and incompatibility with battery components. To circumvent these challenges, weak acids (e.g., HCOOH and H3PO4) have been strategically selected as alternative electrolytes due to their non&#8208;corrosive characteristics. Particularly, the implementation of high&#8208;concentration &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;acid&#8221; (WIA) effectively suppresses undesirable interactions between electrode materials and free water molecules. Through electrolyte engineering, we developed a 9.5&#160;M H3PO4 WIA system that synergizes with a molybdenum trioxide electrode, achieving remarkable electrochemical performance: a high reversible capacity of 229.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;A g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability with 83.86% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1, surpassing conventional H&#8322;SO&#8324;&#8208;based systems by both capacity and cyclability. This innovative approach establishes a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance aqueous energy storage systems through acid&#8208;dominated electrolyte design.

         <title>Functionally Tunable Star&#8208;Shaped Multivalent crRNAs for Photocontrol CRISPR/Cas Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From Line to Stars: Star&#8208;shaped crRNAs with photo&#8208;labile linkers have been successfully designed and constructed to enable precise, wavelength&#8208;specific activation of CRISPR/Cas editing. Using distinct light&#8208;responsive groups, these unique RNA structures allow independent regulation of multiple genes. This innovative approach advances genome engineering, therapeutic strategies, and complex biological research.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas)&#8208;based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility. However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications. Herein, we introduce a novel class of star&#8208;shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems. These crRNAs are synthesized via single&#8208;site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified. By integrating distinct photo&#8208;responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously. This method demonstrated robust OFF&#8208;ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation. Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation. Due to its target sequence&#8208;independent, single&#8208;site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes. Future advancements incorporating long&#8208;wavelength responsive and reversible linkers promise further enhancement of tissue penetration and control, significantly broadening the applicability and impact of this approach in biological research and therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy nanosheets with both high catalytic activity and high protonic conductivity have been prepared. This bifunction integration enables the fabrication of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent catalyst/ionomer layer for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalyst that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancy&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layers in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.

&lt;/i&gt;IrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; nanosheets with both high catalytic activity and high protonic conductivity have been prepared. This bifunction integration enables the fabrication of a low-iridium-loading, low-ionomer-dependent catalyst/ionomer layer for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and protonic conducting ionomer and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalyst that possesses both IrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack and demonstrate its ability to construct high-performance, low-ionomer-dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton-conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(Na&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancy-rich, 1&#160;nm-thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;-H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;IrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;-H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;IrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in-plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;-H&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Solvent Induced Transformation of Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Large Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Three homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2 were synthesized. Upon stimulation with methanol, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster reaction with in situ generated Ag74 to form Ag86, which subsequently transforms into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. This study represents the first observation of an intercluster reaction during the cluster transformation process.








Abstract
Structural transformation of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters is of significant interest because of its relevance to the formation mechanisms and stability of metal clusters. Herein, we report three large homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag98(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)52](BF4)2, [Ag86(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)50](BF4)4, and [Ag74(2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;C)44](BF4)2, synthesized from the same precursor 2&#8208;CH3C6H4C&#8801;CAg via fine&#8208;tuning the reduction rate. X&#8208;ray crystallography demonstrates that Ino decahedral Ag13 units serve as building blocks in all three nanoclusters. Remarkably, Ag98 undergoes an intercluster transformation in methanol. It initially converts into Ag74, then Ag74 reacts with Ag98 to form Ag86, which eventually is transformed into the thermodynamically stable Ag74. Time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) confirms such a multi&#8208;step reaction process during the transformation, identifying Ag86 as the key intermediate. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural transformation pathways of nanoclusters but also enhance the understanding of transformation mechanisms, contributing to the rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity nanoclusters.

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNA Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine SNAP&#8208;Tag Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNAPR is a ribozyme that repurposes O6&#8208;benzylguanine SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for site&#8208;specific labeling of RNA with bioorthogonal alkyne and azide functional groups, fluorophores or photocrosslinkers. The N1A&#8208;alkylated RNA products were converted to N6A&#8208;modified RNA by Dimroth rearrangement. RNA&#8208;catalyzed fluorescent labeling was shown for tRNA, and protein&#8211;RNA photocrosslinking was demonstrated for an m6A reader protein.








Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of RNAs with functional handles enables studies of RNA structure, fate, function, and interactions. Ribozymes provide an elegant way to covalently modify RNA of interest (ROI). Here, we report that the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 can be employed as a versatile tool for RNA modification and labeling. Using O6&#8208;alkylguanine cofactors, designed in analogy to SNAP&#8208;tag substrates for protein labeling, MTR1 installs various bioorthogonal functional groups at N1 of a specific adenosine in the RNA target. In this application of ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA labeling, MTR1 is now called SNAPR. In contrast to the self&#8208;labeling SNAP&#8208;tag, which is appended to the protein of interest, SNAPR is a truly intermolecular RNA catalyst (active in trans). SNAPR assembles with the ROI to the active ribozyme, allowing for the transfer of clickable tags, such as azide and alkyne moieties, as well as photolabile groups or cross&#8208;linkers from the guanine cofactor to the ROI. Moreover, we demonstrate a two&#8208;step approach to attach labels at N6 of the target adenosine: first, SNAPR generates N1A&#8208;modified RNA, followed by preparative Dimroth rearrangement to produce N6A&#8208;modified RNA. We demonstrate this strategy with p&#8208;azidobenzyl groups as photocrosslinker to generate covalent RNA&#8211;protein conjugates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox for site&#8208;specific RNA modification.

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels Based on Hydration Shielding&#8208;Accelerated Redox Self&#8208;Catalytic Polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP)</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP) method was first developed for implementing the fast preparation of robust polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) without external energy at low monomer concentration. HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP shows attractive applications in scalable manufacture of PZHs coatings on diverse substrates, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, as well as excellent sand fixation ability.








Abstract
Traditional synthesis methods for polyzwitterionic hydrogels involve harsh conditions, such as thermal or UV irradiation, prolonged durations, and high monomer concentrations. Herein, we address these challenges at the meantime by proposing a novel chemical method, called hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP), facilitating the preparation of polyzwitterionic hydrogels. The discovery is that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chains can generate hydration shielding around hydrated zwitterionic monomers, promoting their effective aggregation and rapid crosslinking polymerization under the assistance of silver ions (Ag+)&#8208;potassium persulfate (S2O82&#8208;) redox catalyst. The HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method performs under mild condition (&#8722;5&#160;&#176;C to 37&#160;&#176;C) without extra energy, overcomes the critical monomer polymerization concentration limitation (wt%: 0.3%), and completes within an ultrashort polymerization time (&lt;60&#160;s). The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good antiswelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti&#8208;fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.

The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good antiswelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti-fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS-A-RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS-A-RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Data Guides the Discovery of Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Inhibitors Using DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy to develop a selection platform for lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. The platform integrates proteome&#8208;wide lysine data to select potential targets, and utilizes CoDELs featuring diverse warheads, facilitating the discovery of a series of lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. 








Abstract
Broadening the application of covalent inhibitors requires the exploration of nucleophilic residues beyond cysteine. The covalent DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (CoDEL) represents an advanced technology for covalent drug discovery. However, its application in lysine&#8208;targeting inhibitors remains uncharted territory. Here, we report the utilization of CoDEL selection guided by proteome&#8208;wide data to identify lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. A comprehensive assessment of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) data on lysine distribution and ligandability reveals potential targets for selective covalent inhibition, including phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), bromodomain (BRD) family proteins, and ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N). The 10.7&#8208;million&#8208;member CoDELs, featuring diverse lysine&#8208;reactive warheads, enable the discovery of a series of covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. In&#8208;depth characterization of binding sites and modes of action provides structural and functional insights. Notably, irreversible covalent inhibitors unveil a novel mechanism for regulating UBE2N&#8208;mediated ubiquitination by modulating the conformation of the protein complex. Our work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy, offering an efficient and versatile selection method for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting functional lysines.

         <title>High Performance Capacitive Deionization Cathode of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate Doped with Trace Molybdenum: Breaking the Capacity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high valence metal Mo&#8208;doped NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF electrode exhibits excellent desalination properties, including amazing adsorption capacity and remarkable cycling stability. Structural characterization and DFT studies show that NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF possesses multiple redox sites, low Na+ migration barriers, excellent reaction reversibility, and remarkable structural stability, resulting in an unprecedented improvement in desalination performance.








Abstract
Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is considered one of the most promising electrode materials for capacitive deionization (CDI) because of its excellent cycling stability and other advantages. However, the poor desalination ability and low adsorption capacity caused by a single reaction site seriously restrict its practical application. Here, a high&#8208;valence transition metal element Mo&#8208;doped strategy is proposed to utilize traces of Mo6+ to activate the inert&#8208;sites within NiHCF. The Mo&#8208;doped NiHCF electrodes (NiMox&#8208;HCF) with multiple pairs of redox active sites and long cycling capability were designed, breaking the trade&#8208;off between high adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The results show that the preferred NiMo0.3&#8208;HCF not only retains the excellent cycling stability (91% after 200 cycles), but also possesses a high adsorption capacity of 90.92&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 1.2&#160;V, which is much better than those of NiHCF under the same conditions. In addition, it has good practical application in simulated brackish water and circulating cooling water. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the Mo doping strategy enhanced electronic conductivity while maintaining structural stability. This research proposes a new method to activate inert sites using high&#8208;valence elements, thus effectively balancing the adsorption capacity and cycling stability of the electrode.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts with Improved Metal Loading for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia synthesis is a cornerstone in the chemical industry. Given the traditional Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process requires very high temperature and pressure, it is imperative to develop catalysts capable of facilitating ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. In this work, a post&#8208;metal replacement strategy is developed to improve the Fe loading in single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;implanted N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts. Starting from the Zn&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C material with single&#8208;atom Zn and Fe sites coexisting in N&#8208;doped porous carbon pyrolyzed from porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the replacement of single&#8208;atom Zn with Fe sites is performed, which significantly increases the Fe loading from 1.33 wt% to 2.39 wt%. This effectively suppresses the migration and agglomeration of Fe, yielding Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C with high metal loading (FeHL&#8208;N&#8208;C). Notably, the FeHL&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits a catalytic rate of 558 &#956;mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 300 &#176;C for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure, far surpassing the performance of the traditional dominant fused iron and even Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>LC&#8208;MS and High&#8208;Throughput Data Processing Solutions for Lipid Metabolic Tracing Using Biorthogonal Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tracing lipid metabolism in mammalian cells presents a significant technological challenge due to the vast structural diversity of lipids involved in multiple metabolic routes. Biorthogonal approaches based on click chemistry have revolutionized analytical performance in lipid tracing. When adapted for mass spectrometry (MS), it enables highly specific and sensitive analyses of lipid transformations at the lipidome scale. Here, we advance this approach by integrating liquid chromatography (LC) prior to MS detection and developing a software&#8208;assisted workflow for high&#8208;throughput data processing. LC separation resolved labelled and unmodified lipids, enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of both lipidome fractions, as well as isomeric lipid species. Using synthetic standards and endogenously produced alkyne lipids, we characterized LC&#8208;MS behaviour, including preferential adduct formation and extent of in&#8208;source fragmentation. Specific fragmentation rules derived from tandem MS experiments for 23 lipid subclasses, were implemented in Lipostar2 software for high&#8208;throughput annotation and quantification of labelled lipids. Applying this platform, we traced metabolic pathways of palmitic and oleic acid alkynes, revealing distinct lipid incorporation patterns and metabolic bottlenecks. Altogether, here we provide integrated analytical and bioinformatics platform for high&#8208;throughput tracing of lipid metabolism using LC&#8208;MS workflow.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Cold Adaptation of Bidomain Amylases by High&#8208;Throughput Computational Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cold&#8208;adapted bidomain enzymes have the potential to&#160;foster industrial sustainability by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their allure, these benefits are unattainable as the molecular basis of cold adaptation remains elusive and there are no strategies to guide the acquisition of this behavior. To uncover principles of cold adaptation, we selected the cold&#8208;adapted Saccharophagus degradans amylase (sdA) and mesophilic Pseudomonas saccharophila amylase (psA) as model systems to study. Through molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical assays, we found that sdA exhibits significantly greater interdomain separation between its catalytic domain (CD) and carbohydrate&#8208;binding module (CBM) at low temperatures. Guided by this insight, we introduce the domain separation index (DSI) metric to guide in&#8208;silico screening of 120 psA variants using high&#8208;throughput enzyme modeling. The highest ranked variant, psA121, shows a 3&#8208;fold increase in relative activity over the wild type at 0&#176;C. MD simulations suggest that psA121 achieves cold adaptation via helical linkers which induce interdomain separation and enhance flexibility of the active&#8208;site and binding loop via dynamic allostery, promoting substrate recruitment, binding, and catalysis at lower temperatures. This study highlights how domain separation contributes to cold adaptation in bidomain amylases and offers strategies for introducing such cold&#8208;adaption to other systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanochanneling and Local Crystallization Engineering Accelerate Multiphase Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for Rapid Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise engineering single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with optimal hierarchical structures and favorable local chemical environment remains a significant challenge to cater for multiphase heterogeneous processes. Here, we develop a universal strategy for synthesizing channel&#8208;digging microspherical SACs that markedly enhance gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid mass transfer and fine&#8208;tune the thermodynamics of catalytic ozonation. By catalytically graphitizing carbon microspheres and selectively etching amorphous carbon domains via mild combustion, we fabricate cross&#8208;linked hierarchical graphitic nanochannels confining transition metal (e.g., Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) single atoms (TMCSs&#8208;Air). This nanoenvironment engineering increases interfacial O3 mass transfer by 3.2&#8208;fold and directs O3 adsorption from a conventional &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a bidental &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. The enhanced inter&#8208;orbital electronic interactions lower the O3 activation barrier and form highly oxidizing surface&#8208;confined O3 (*O3). Consequently, the CoCSs&#8208;Air catalyst achieves a 3.6&#8208;fold higher ozone utilization efficiency and a 4.2&#8208;fold greater turnover frequency (TOF = 1580 min&#8722;1) compared with pristine Co&#8208;SAC&#8208;doped carbon microspheres. Technical and economic evaluations further confirm the feasibility of TMCSs&#8208;Air nanoreactors in treating real&#8208;world petrochemical wastewater, highlighting its broader potential in overcoming gas diffusion barriers and tuning reaction pathways for multiphase heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

The enhanced inter-orbital electronic interactions lower the O3 activation barrier and form highly oxidizing surface-confined O3 (*O3). Consequently, the CoCSs-Air catalyst achieves a 3.6-fold higher ozone utilization efficiency and a 4.2-fold greater turnover frequency (TOF = 1580 min&#8722;1) compared with pristine Co-SAC-doped carbon microspheres.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks as electrocatalysts for boosting glycerol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorisation of glycerol using renewable electricity is recognised as an effective and attractive approach for producing high&#8208;value compounds from biomass by&#8208;products. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts due to their tunable structures, high electronic conductivity, and efficient utilisation of well&#8208;defined active centers. In this study, we report the first systematic investigation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with Ni&#8208;X4 (X = O or N) moieties for the glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), examining key factors influencing both electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. In situ&#8208;13C electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies provide insights into the GOR mechanism and confirm Ni&#8208;O4 sites as the primary active centers. Theoretical calculations further reveal that Ni3(HHTQ)2 exhibits superior GOR activity due to strong adsorption of reaction intermediates and weak interlayer interactions. This work highlights the potential of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as highly efficient GOR catalysts, paving the way for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and contributing to the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for the Catalytic Mechanism of ATP&#8208;Dependent Diazotase CmaA6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although several diazotases have been recently reported, the details of the reaction mechanism are not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CmaA6, an ATP&#8208;dependent diazotase that catalyzes the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid using nitrous acid. X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy&#8208;single particle analysis revealed CmaA6 structures in the substrate&#8208;free and AMP&#8208;binding states. Kinetic analysis suggested that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via a sequential reaction mechanism in which three substrates (nitrous acid, ATP, and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid) are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket. The nitrous acid&#8208; and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid&#8208;binding sites were predicted based on the AMP&#8208;binding state and confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. In addition, computational analysis revealed a tunnel for 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid to enter the reaction pocket, which was advantageous for the sequential reaction mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of diazotization in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metathetical Exchange, Synthesis and Carbon Dioxide Addition of Higher Homologues of Group 9 Metal Carbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of group 9 metal carbynes [(Me3P)3Co&#186;GeAr*] (1), [(Me3P)3Rh&#186;GeAr*] (2), [(Me3P)3Ir&#186;GeAr*] (3), [(Me3P)3Ir&#186;SnAr*] (5), and [(Et3P)3Ir&#186;PbAr*] (7) is presented [Ar* = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Trip)2, Trip = 2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3]. During these preparations the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh&#186;SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh&#186;PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. This metathesis reaction was tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]&#8208;fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar = Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2&#8208;5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M&#8208;E(&#951;2&#8208;O2CO&#8208;&#954;2O)Ar*] [E = Ge, M= Rh (11); M = Ir (12); E = Sn, M = Rh (14), M = Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the group 14 element. For tin the intermediates formed by mono CO2 addition [(Me3P)3M(&#181;,&#951;2&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O)SnAr*] [M = Rh (13), M = Ir (15)] have been isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarization Modulation of the T&#8208;type hCav3.2 Channel by Human Synenkephalin [1&#8211;53], a Shrew Neurotoxin Analogue without Paralytic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian secreted venoms mainly consist of peptides and proteases used for defense or predation. Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs), mealworm&#8208;targeting neurotoxins from shrew, are very similar to human synenkephalin. This peptide is released from proenkephalin in the brain along with opioid peptides that mediate analgesic and antidepressant effects, though its physiological function is unclear. Here we synthesized and characterized human synenkephalin [1&#8211;53] (hSYN), and reveal its disulfide bond connectivity. Similar to BPP2, hSYN caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the human T&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated calcium channel (hCav3.2) at 0.74 &#181;M, but did not paralyze mealworms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hSYN and BPP2 interact with hCav3.2 channel differently, due to differences in polar residues. Since Cav3.2 channel regulates neuronal excitability and is implicated in conditions like autism and epilepsy, our findings on hSYN could provide insights into the channel gating and agonistic mechanisms, along with potential pathways for developing treatments for neurological disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Main Group Mechanocatalytic CO2 Valorisation to Carbonate Species.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, main group elements have gained attention as promising substitutes for precious metals in catalytic processes. Additionally, mechanochemistry is emerging as a field with the potential to promote catalytic reactions under mild conditions. Herein, we report a scalable, main&#8208;group mechanocatalytic synthesis of cyclic carbonates from both solid and liquid epoxides, using CO&#8322; as a renewable feedstock under mild conditions with a gallium aminotrisphenolate catalyst. Unlike solution&#8208;based methods, which generally require high temperatures and/or high CO&#8322; pressures, this mechanocatalytic process operates at just 1 bar and room temperature. The developed mechanochemical method affords the targeted compounds in high yields, while also enabling efficient transformation of multi&#8208;terminal epoxides and avoiding the conversion losses typically observed in solution. Furthermore, this scalable method outperforms solution&#8208;based approaches across all green metrics, setting a new benchmark for environmentally friendly synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoconfined&#160;Ultrathin&#160;Polymer Membrane for Ultrafast Separation of Biobutanol from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient recovery of biobutanol, a next&#8208;generation biofuel, from fermentation liquor remains challenging due to its low concentration and volatility. This study introduces ultrathin rubbery polymer membranes developed through an interfacial dissolution&#8208;crosslinking method, with crosslinked polysiloxane&#160;confined within the permanent nanovoids&#160;of ceramic alumina substrates. The resulting membranes, which are less than 10 nm thick, achieve unparalleled performance: concentrating 1.0 wt.% aqueous&#160;n&#8208;butanol 14.2&#8208;fold with a record&#8208;high liquid flux of 110 kg m&#8208;2h&#8208;1&#160;&#8212;&#160;one to&#160;two orders of magnitude greater than those of previously reported membranes. These advancements suggest significant reductions in the membrane area and operational costs for large&#8208;scale biobutanol separation, establishing a sustainable and economical solution for biofuel production.</dc:description>

         <title>Restoring cell&#8208;cell communication to elicit bystander effect using DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex for robust immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has shown promise in enhancing antitumor immunity. However, the pathway involved de novo transcription and translation processes, which delays immune responses. Besides, the rapid clearance of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) by extracellular hydrolase limits its availability, attenuating STING signaling and resulting in insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we constructed a DNA&#8208;based nanocomplex, which could restore cell&#8208;cell communication to elicit bystander effect for enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING responses. By virtue of its capabilities to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells through bioorthogonal reaction&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis and to promote gap junctional intercellular communication for cGAMP transfer, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was activated and amplified in a horizontal manner. The nanocomplex presented safe and robust antitumor effects against not only primary tumors, but also distant and metastatic tumors via abscopal effects. The work highlighted the effects of restoring cell&#8208;cell communication on cGAS&#8208;STING activation and provided a new perspective for antitumor immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Hyperpolarized MRI Enabled by Ace&#8208;SABRE of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized (HP) MRI using [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate is emerging as a promising molecular imaging approach. Among hyperpolarization methods, Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is attractive because SABRE polarizes the substrates directly in room&#8208;temperature solutions avoiding complex hardware. Most SABRE experiments have historically been performed in methanol, a relatively toxic and difficult to remove solvent. Here we demonstrate the use of a 80/20 acetone&#8208;water&#8208;solvent system (Ace&#8208;SABRE) to provide hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate with up to 17% polarization, then implement a solvent processing protocol to achieve injectable solutions retaining 74% of the initial polarization, and lastly we demonstrate HP in vivo spectroscopy and imaging using the Ace&#8208;SABRE platform to showcase metabolic tracking in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor as well as HP&#8208;MRI, both in direct comparison to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) experiments. The Ace&#8208;SABRE technique promises faster adoption of SABRE hyperpolarization in biological experiments, overall lowering the barriers to entry for HP&#8208;NMR and HP&#8208;MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoengineering Carbon Dot&#8208;Polymer Brush Interfaces for Adaptive Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a versatile platform for fabricating two&#8208;photon excitable carbon dot&#8208;based nanocomposite thin films by harnessing the structural versatility of polymer brushes in combination with electron&#8208;beam lithography (EBL). This approach enables the precise spatial organization of carbon dots (CDs) at the nanoscale, facilitating dynamic modulation of their photoluminescent properties in response to environmental stimuli. Three model systems were examined, incorporating pH&#8208; and thermally responsive polymers, functionalized through covalent and dynamic covalent bonding strategies. By leveraging the spatial control afforded by nanostructured polymer brushes, we achieved precise tuning of optical properties while mitigating aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, a longstanding challenge in solid&#8208;state CD applications. In addition to the advances in controlling optical properties, this work highlights the potential of polymer brush systems to function as optically active, reprogrammable surfaces. The resulting nanoscale&#8208;engineered materials exhibit highly responsive, reconfigurable photonic behavior, offering a scalable pathway for integrating advanced optical interfaces into microchip technologies, biosensing platforms, and multiplexed diagnostic systems. The fusion of polymer brushes, carbon dots, and advanced lithographic techniques marks a substantial advancement in the development of functional materials with nanoscale precision and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Ion Diode Membrane (PIDM) for Enhanced Nanofluidic Ion Transport and Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The output power densities for osmotic energy harvesting are often limited by the insufficient membranes permselectivity and inherent ion concentration polarization (ICP) phenomenon. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired plasmonic ion diode membrane (PIDM) was designed and fabricated for enhanced ion transport and osmotic energy harvesting by integrating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and three&#8208;dimensional Au nanoparticles (3D AuNPs) into anode aluminum oxide (AAO). Under light irradiation, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation of 3D AuNPs can release huge plasmonic heat and produce abundant hot charge carriers (hot electrons and holes) simultaneously. The former heats the solution and generates a thermal gradient for boosting ion flux, while the latter transfers to the COFs layer, increasing charge density for promoting ion permselectivity. Importantly, it has been found that different COFs with varied pore sizes and charges have obvious influence on energy harvesting efficiency. Under the optimum condition, a high output power density of 65.7 W m&#8208;2 in a 500&#8208;fold concentration gradient could be achieved. This work provides a practical and efficient way to boost ion transport and enhance osmotic energy conversion by utilizing the synergistic effect of plasmonics and ID property.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization and insertion chemistry of imidosilanes enabled by reversible Si(IV)/Si(II) redox shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous redox shuttling at silicon is very rare, primarily reflecting the thermodynamic challenges associated with reduction processes for lighter&#160;p&#8208;block elements. Here we show that the reactions of boryl&#8208;substituted silylene&#160;{PhC(tBuN)2}Si{B(NDippCH)2} with an organo&#8208;azide proceed through a Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) series of redox processes involving both oxidative and reductive ligand migration steps. Each of the isomeric compounds related through this reaction manifold is isolable (and can be structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography), with the overall free energy profile being close to thermo&#8208;neutral. Broader studies within group 14 imply that this redox shuttling is unique to silicon, and that reductive ligand migration also plays a role in O&#8208;atom insertion chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Abiotic Synthesis of Ribose on Chiral Mesostructured Hydroxyapatite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice&#8208;distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d&#8208;malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d&#8208;ribose was achieved on the d&#8208;CMHAPFs formed by d&#8208;MA. The adsorption conformation of d&#8208;ribose on the surface of right&#8208;handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l&#8208;ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose are crucial processes in the origin of life. However, the prebiotic emergence of enantiomerically enriched ribose on primitive Earth remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we propose that the prebiotic enantioselective synthesis of ribose from glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde can be catalyzed by minerals naturally endowed with chiral structure. The chiral mesostructured hydroxyapatite films (CMHAPFs), which consist of lattice-distorted helical nanorods, can be formed under a hydrothermal condition in the presence of l/d-malic acid (MA), a compound that may have been present during the early stages of life's emergence. An enantiomeric excess (ee) of 22.5% for d-ribose was achieved on the d-CMHAPFs formed by d-MA. The adsorption conformation of d-ribose on the surface of right-handed hydroxyapatite is more stable than that of l-ribose. The different energy barriers for the transition states of ribose enantiomers result in the enantioselective synthesis of ribose, which is attributed to the similar conformation between ribose and the corresponding transition state. Our findings provide valuable insights into the possible role of chiral inorganics in the prebiotic synthesis and symmetry breaking of ribose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bayesian Meta&#8208;Learning for Few&#8208;Shot Reaction Outcome Prediction of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed an increasing application of machine learning (ML) in reaction development. These ML methods, in general, require huge training set examples. The published literature has large amounts of data, but there are modelling challenges due to the sparse nature of these datasets. Here we report a meta&#8208;learning workflow that can utilize the literature&#8208;mined data and return accurate predictions with limited data. A literature dataset comprising of over 12,000 transition metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins (AHO) is chosen to demonstrate the utility of our protocol. A meta&#8208;model is trained in a binary classification setting to identify highly enantioselective AHO reactions. Two Bayesian meta&#8208;learning approaches are considered, namely, deep kernel transfer (DKT) and adaptive deep kernel fitting (ADKF). Both these methods returned better predictions compared to prototypical network. The single&#8208;task methods such as random forest and&#160;graph neural network&#160;performed worse than meta&#8208;learning methods. Additionally, we propose another meta&#8208;learning approach called ADKF&#8208;prior that is shown to further improve the performance in low&#8208;data settings. Our meta&#8208;learning workflow can be utilized to build a pretrained meta&#8208;model for any reaction of interest, which can then be useful to predict the outcome of new but related reactions in a few&#8208;shot manner.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional electrolytes in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) suffer from irreversible interfacial degradation at elevated temperatures and sluggish Li&#8314; desolvation/transport kinetics under cryogenic conditions. Herein, we present an innovative semi&#8208;solvated hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME) diluent in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) that strategically addresses these limitations. Li&#8314; hopping networks within the electrolyte can be preserved even at low temperature due to the coordination of lithiophilic groups in HFME molecules with Li&#8314;. Simultaneously, lithiophobic group induced spatial confinement effects promote the formation of anion&#8208;cation aggregates (AGGs), significantly optimizing Li&#8314; desolvation kinetics and boosting the formation of inorganic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with exceptional thermal stability. Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) cell with the diluent&#8208;coordinated LHCEs (DCL) can deliver 125.4 mA h g&#8208;1 initial capacity at &#8208;20&#176;C with 92.2% retention after 150 cycles. Under elevated temperatures (65&#176;C), the DCL based Li||LFP cell can maintain the capacity retention of 91.3% over 60 cycles.&#160;The Li||NCM811&#160;pouch cell (10 cm &#215; 6.5 cm,&#160;capacity: 1000 mA h) based on the&#160;DCL exhibits outstanding cycling stability, retaining 91.6% of its initial capacity after 75 cycles. This work pioneers a solvent chemistry paradigm through spatially modulated solvation structures, establishing fundamental design principles for electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Crystallographic Effect in Radially Architectured Polycrystalline Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxide cathode materials with primary&#8208;secondary architecture face challenges of inhomogeneous Li+ diffusion and chemomechanical degradation due to misorientations between equiaxed primary particles. While a radial architecture, featuring elongated grains, is widely believed to enhance diffusion, it does not address the root cause of chemomechanical failure&#8212;crystallographic misorientation. The impact of crystallography on the electrochemical performance of radially architectured secondary particles, compared to conventional designs, remains poorly understood. Here, by combining transmission Kikuchi diffraction with multimodal characterization, we decipher the crucial role of crystallography in the performance and stability of polycrystalline high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode materials. Contrary to the conventional belief that a preferential texture induced by the radial architecture is the key to performance enhancement, we uncover that the radial architecturing primarily alters the misorientation distribution by introducing substantially increased low&#8208;angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries that significantly mitigate chemomechanical cracking and phase degradation. This crystallographic refinement facilitates enhanced Li+ diffusion between primary particles, ultimately boosting the rate capability and long&#8208;term stability of the cathodes. By quantitatively uncovering the crystallographic influence on performance, this work provides a new avenue for optimizing Li+ diffusion kinetics and chemomechanical resilience in polycrystalline cathode materials through crystallographic engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electronic Charge Transport in Conductive Hydrogels via Rapid Ion&#8208;Electron Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional design of conductive hydrogels involves embedding conductive components within a hydrated polymeric network to establish interconnected electron pathways. While the hydration shell of the polymeric network is typically considered insulating, we demonstrate that it can, in fact, enhance electron transport. Using a PEDOT:PSS hydrogel, we propose a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous topological structure, consisting of entangled PSS chains, dense PSS assemblies, and PEDOT microcrystals. In the hydrated state, the dense PSS assemblies significantly lower the energy barrier for electron hopping between PEDOT microcrystals, thereby promoting electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels is predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of electronic conductors. The charge transport rate reaches up to 2 &#215; 106 m/s, which is approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of ion&#8208;based processes. This characteristic imparts the hydrogels with kinetically sensitive ion&#8208;electron transduction, enabling time&#8208;resolved electrochemical analysis of biochemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Family of Chiral Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a Fused Sidechain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although a considerable number of chiral nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been developed, yet it is highly necessary to develop new NHCs bearing multiple sites for facile modifications of both electronic nature and steric hindrance. Herein, we uncover a new family of chiral non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric NHCs with a fused sidechain, whose precursors are synthesized by a simple five&#8208;step route. The synthesis includes Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling or nucleophilic addition/oxidation, chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reduction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;quinolines, bromination at C8, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, and cyclization with methyl orthoformate. Among nine prepared NHCs, YC&#8208;NHC8 is the optimal ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric SN2&#8242; silylation, YC&#8208;NHC3 works as the best ligand for Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate silylation of simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and YC&#8208;NHC9 serves as the most suitable ligand for copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric silylation of azadienes. Remarkably, these three reactions are successfully run under a catalyst loading of 0.1 mol %, indicating that YC&#8208;NHCs may have the potential to be broadly used in efficient asymmetric transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ketones Enabled by a Carboxylic Acid Additive Promotion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Ferromagnetic Ordering Outperforms Coordination Effects in Governing Oxygen Reduction Catalysis on High&#8208;index Nickel Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of surface spin configuration in spin&#8208;dependent catalytic reactions remains contentious, particularly when compared to the established dominance of coordination environments. Here, we resolve this debate by systematically probing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mechanisms on high&#8208;index Ni single&#8208;crystal facets ([210], [310], [520]) through integrated density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. Contrary to conventional d&#8208;band center predictions, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic ordering fundamentally dictates catalytic activity by stabilizing triplet O2 adsorption and lowering spin&#8208;forbidden transition barriers. The Ni (210) facet exhibits superior ORR performance (half&#8208;wave potential: 0.842 V vs. RHE), outperforming Ni (310) and Ni (520) due to its optimized d&#8208;band center alignment and enhanced saturation magnetization. External magnetic fields amplify this effect, yielding a 28% current density enhancement for Ni (210)&#8212;nearly triple that of Ni (520). Spin&#8208;polarized DFT calculations reveal that ferromagnetic ordering reduces the potential&#8208;determining step energy barrier for *OH desorption by 7.0%, overriding coordination&#8208;number effects. These findings establish ferromagnetic alignment as a critical design criterion for spin&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, offering a paradigm shift from coordination&#8208;centric optimization to spin&#8208;polarized interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>NO&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Nanovesicles with Co&#8208;Stimulatory Molecule Self&#8208;Presentation for Multidimensional Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistically improving T cell responsiveness represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors; however, current treatments struggle to fully activate cancer&#8208;immunity cascade. We propose a novel gas&#8208;assisted sonosensitizer&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanoplatform, triggering ultrasonic&#8208;sensitive tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and cascading immune activation. Upon ultrasound stimulation, the nanocore liberates ROS and NO, generating highly toxic peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) in situ. The ONOO&#8208; then orchestrated several intracellular events, including protein S&#8208;nitrosylation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis&#8208;mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and ICD&#8208;enhanced immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, the biomimetic artificial dendritic cell (DC) membranes, from genetically engineered tumor cells, simultaneously present peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHC&#8208;I) and CD86, enabling homologous tumor targeting but also mimicking the antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling of DCs to directly activate infiltrating T lymphocytes. In multiple murine models, this nanovaccine demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy, including tumor suppression, long&#8208;lasting antitumor immunity, and tumor metastasis inhibition. The ultrasound&#8208;responsive nanoDCs offer a promising paradigm for multifaceted immune boosters to address the challenges of immune tolerance and suboptimal patient response.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ &#8220;Confocal&#8221; Electrochemiluminescence 3D Imaging: From Cell to Tissue Section</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging technique with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) resolution to investigate specimens at varying axial depths poses a challenging yet significant objective. Herein, a &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was developed using luminol as the ECL probe, in which the excited luminophore was formed in the vicinity of electrode surface through homogeneous chemical reactions between oppositely diffusing ECL precursors, luminol diazaquinone intermediate (L) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), confining the ECL emission in a thin plane (ECL focal plane) parallel to the electrode surface at their intersection. The regulating ability of electrochemical method on the reaction fluxes of L and H2O2 was validated, realizing in&#8208;situ regulation of the axial location of the ECL focal plane from 0 to 63 &#956;m. Leveraging the optical sectioning capability of the ECL focal plane, the &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging method was applied to bioimaging, from cells to tissue sections. It revealed cellular morphology changes during cell polarity establishment and the heterogeneous distribution of complex tubule structure in kidney tissue sections. The optical sectioning capability of &#8220;confocal&#8221; 3D ECL imaging makes it a powerful tool for studying complex biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Serving as Cocatalyst for the Highly Efficient Homogeneously Catalyzed Conversion of N2O/H2 Mixtures with Optimized Rhodium NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a valuable oxygen/nitrogen transfer reagent but reactions with N2O are challenging due to its inertness. Consequently, it accumulates in the atmosphere, and because it is both an ozone&#8208;depleting reagent and potent green&#8208;house gas, effective mitigation methods become important. This study presents rhodium(I) amido bis(olefin) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes [Rh(trop2N)(NHC)] as robust homogeneous catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of N2O. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations show that increasing &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC and the presence of water significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency. The rhodium&#8208;amido bond facilitates cooperative H2&#8208;cleavage and oxygen atom transfer from N2O. The catalyst is regenerated with the loss of water from the hydroxide intermediate [Rh(OH)(trop2NH)(NHC)], which forms a dimeric complex with a central bridging hydrated hydroxide ligand [H3O2]&#8722;. Water facilitates dinitrogen (N2) loss from an intermediate containing an oxy&#8208;diazene ligand [H&#8211;N=N&#8211;O]&#8722;. The optimized catalyst achieves a TON &gt; 230,000 and TOF &gt; 1,300 h&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic regulation of intermolecular interactions is essential for the creation of dynamic supramolecular materials with lifelike self&#8208;regulating functions. Yet specific ion effect, which is known to possess potent effect on intermolecular interactions, has remained unexplored for such a purpose. Here, we demonstrate our access to dynamic self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular hydrogels by orchestrating the Hofmeister effect through a simple enzymatic reaction. The involved gelators containing carboxylate moieties self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel1) at acidic pH and dissolve at basic pH. We surprisingly find that the dissolved gelators at basic pH can be driven to self&#8208;assemble into hydrogel (Gel2) by kosmotropic ions through the disruption of gelator&#8208;water interactions. By coupling to the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea, Gel1 gradually disintegrates over time because of the production of basic NH3. However, interestingly, with the accumulation of kosmotropic ions, NH4+ and CO32&#8208;, the dissolved gelators are driven to self&#8208;assemble into Gel2, realizing a self&#8208;regulating gel&#8208;sol&#8208;gel transition process. The transition rate and stiffness of Gel2 are tunable by adjusting the concentrations of urea or urease. This work may shed light on the creation of lifelike self&#8208;regulating supramolecular materials using Hofmeister effect for many enticing applications such as ion&#8208;programmed biosensing and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Branched and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cationic Ir(I)&#8208;complex modified with the chiral diphosphine DM&#8208;SEGPHOS mediates the hydroalkylation of diverse &#945;&#8208;methyl styrenes with N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives. The processes occur with complete branched selectivity and high enantioselectivity. Styrenes possessing higher &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituents also participate to provide the targets with moderate to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. The products are readily advanced to &#946;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are inaccessible or cumbersome to access by other means. In broader terms, the study demonstrates how catalyst controlled C&#8208;H additions across alkenes can be used to execute the byproduct free construction of contiguous acyclic trisubstituted and quaternary centers.</dc:description>

Styrenes possessing higher &#945;-alkyl substituents also participate to provide the targets with moderate to excellent levels of diastereoselectivity. The products are readily advanced to &#946;-quaternary &#945;-amino acids that are inaccessible or cumbersome to access by other means. In broader terms, the study demonstrates how catalyst controlled C-H additions across alkenes can be used to execute the byproduct free construction of contiguous acyclic trisubstituted and quaternary centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Disruption of 1D Wire&#8208;Like Arrays of Monoatomic Ag(I) Ions: Single&#8208;Crystal Reaction with Crystal Softening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploitation of noncovalent bonding in the solid state is attractive to generate one&#8208;dimensional (1D) wire&#8208;like assemblies of metals and uncover dynamic and physical properties of such intriguing structures. Herein, we describe a metal&#8208;organic crystal based on Ag(I) ions that assemble to be organized into 1D wire&#8208;like assemblies maintained by argentophilic interactions. UV&#8208;light irradiation of the crystal composed of the 1D structures results in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization that transforms the 1D periodic metal arrays to isolated metal dimers. The structural reconfiguration creates small voids in the crystal and the resulting solids exhibit a substantial increase in softness up to 60%.</dc:description>

         <title>Coronal Complexation Induces Snowman&#8208;Shaped Janus Polymersome Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering polymersome shape is a keen area of interest because minimal variations in polymersome properties can greatly affect the performance of nanoreactors, drug delivery vehicles, and more. Although methods to transform polymersome shapes have been evolving rapidly, limitations remain in the scope of applicable polymersome compositions and adaptability to engineer a desired shape. In this work, we developed a method utilizing cationic polymer additives and coronal complexation to transform charged spherical polymersomes into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. The resulting morphologies feature a hollow polymersome compartment conjoined to a protruding bleb consisting of the complexed polymer additive, which we propose forms via a dewetting process. This methodology provides enhanced shape control through adjustments in additive composition or plasticizer content, offering additional routes to engineering novel polymersome structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored polymer&#8208;zeolite imidazolate framework membranes for aperture&#8208;matched C4 hydrocarbon separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with polymers for efficient C4 hydrocarbon separation membranes remains challenging, primarily due to inherent phase incompatibility. This work presents an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for polymer&#8208;zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (polyZIF), utilizing polymer&#8208;metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds combined with structural directing agents to produce crystalline microporous frameworks. With an accessible BET surface area of 261 m2/g and a permanent porosity (ca. 4.42 &#197;), polyZIF membrane demonstrates butadiene permeance (~332 GPU) and the selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butene, and iso&#8208;butane (17.2, 28.1, 21.5, and 34.8) under mixed gas conditions, respectively. By enhancing dispersibility and minimizing interfacial defects, polyZIFs enables the scalable fabrication of large&#8208;area membranes (up to 80 cm2) while maintaining robust C4 separation performance. This advancement not only establishes a novel preparation for constructing polyZIF membranes with C4 hydrocarbon molecular&#8208;sieving capability but also provides critical insights into industrial application of ZIF&#8208;based polymer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Target Agnostic Photoaffinity Labelling by Sulfonylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonyl hydrazones were identified as new photo&#8208;crosslinkers exploiting their base catalyzed low&#8208;energy photoactivation that leads to reactive carbenes. The amino acid promiscuity, their usefulness in proteomics application and the range of labelled targets including enzymes, a PPI target and a transcription factor suggests that sulfonyl hydrazones might be a target agnostic alternative to current photoaffinity tags. Their synthetic availability and the option of late&#8208;stage formation make them beneficial in both chemical biology and drug discovery applications.







Abstract
Photoaffinity labeling is a widely used methodology for interrogating small molecule&#8208;protein interactions. However, these applications are limited by the few photo&#8208;crosslinkers that typically modify the affinity and the binding mode of the original ligand. Here, we report the development of new target agnostic photoaffinity warheads, sulfohydrazones that form a reactive carbene upon UV irradiation. Careful optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to effectively label five different amino acid residues in proteins. Our approach turned biologically relevant hydrazones and sulfohydrazones to intrinsically irreversible covalent binders without structural modifications by photoactivation as demonstrated on monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8208;A) enzyme and STAT5b (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b) transcription factor. Sulfohydrazones are readily accessible by transforming the corresponding carbonyl group of a ligand or a suitable tag that extends the application domain of the method for any ligands exemplified by conditional labelling of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme and the oncogenic mutant of GTP&#8208;ase KRasG12D.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Recycling Strategy for Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Neutral Solution Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the overuse of strong acids and bases in the conventional hydrometallurgy process, a delicate strategy has been proposed, which is pioneeringly applied in the neutral solution environment. Particularly, in situ primary battery effect based on the solid&#8208;solid reduction is designed and constructed, which can effectively enhance the reduction efficiency of high&#8208;valent metals by leveraging electron transfer during the neutral leaching. Thus, it can achieve ultrafast efficiency with reduced chemical consumption and corrosive wastewater, thus providing a promising and economic pathway for the battery recycling.







Abstract
Traditional acid or/and ammonia leaching techniques are usually applied to extract valuable metals during hydrometallurgical recovery of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the excessive and repeated use of acids and bases inevitably increases the environmental burden and safety threats. Herein, considering the advantages of neutral pH solution system in terms of safety and environmental protection, neutral leaching has been pioneeringly proposed to achieve a low&#8208;cost and harmless hydrometallurgical process. Specifically, benefited from the ligand complexation reaction of glycine, the valuable metals can be efficiently leached within neutral environment. More importantly, a strategy of solid&#8208;solid reduction with primary batteries effect is employed to achieve an efficient neutral leaching within rapid time, breaking through the reaction limitation of shrinking core model. As anticipated, an efficient leaching of 99.99&#8201;% Li, 96.86&#8201;% Ni, 92.35&#8201;% Co, and 90.59&#8201;% Mn can be achieved within 15 minutes, which has extended applications for various kinds of layered cathodes. Therefore, it is sturdily confirmed that the intractable problem, the effective extraction is available only under the aggressive acid/alkali&#8208;ion conditions, is well&#8208;solved within a mild leaching atmosphere. This green and efficient strategy in neutral solution environment opens a new pathway to realize the large&#8208;scale pollution&#8208;free recycling of spent batteries.

The chiral (BisSalen)Al catalyst promoted highly regioselective and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization was achieved, delivering completely alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with enhanced thermal property, linear degradation and controlled drug release behavior. The completely alternating sequence makes the resultant PLGA an ideal carrier for mild long&#8208;acting drug delivery.







Abstract
The poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) with completely alternating sequence has attracted growing attention as an ideal candidate in controlled drug delivery. However, the approach to completely alternating PLGA remains a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of completely alternating PLGA via highly regioselective and stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The chiral (BisSalen)Al catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of enantiopure 3&#8208;methyl glycolide (MeG) with highly glycolyl site selectivity, affording alternating PLGA with regioselectivity up to more than 99&#8201;%. Impressively, the completely alternating PLGA exhibited a well&#8208;defined melting temperature Tm of 143.1&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, a stereocomplex between PLLGA and PDLGA was also formed with the improved Tm of 211.8&#8201;&#176;C. The In vitro degradation and drug release experiments revealed the linear degradation and controlled drug release behavior of completely alternating PLGA, which can be used as an ideal carrier for mild long&#8208;acting drug delivery. Meanwhile, the reason of the high regioselectivity was investigated through the control experiments and DFT calculation. This highly regioselective (BisSalen)Al catalyst opens a door to providing completely alternating polymers.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transmission and Amplification from Cellulose Derivative to Achiral Helical Polymer for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of cellulose derivative and racemic helical polyacetylene achieves full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The elegant combination of solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transmission and fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption further enables the CPL handedness and intensity to be easily tunable, providing a novel strategy for the construction and performance regulation of cellulose&#8208;based chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Cellulose derivatives represent a promising natural chiral platform for creating circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials owing to their excellent processability and structural diversity. However, achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions based on cellulose derivatives remains challenging. The present work reports the first success in achieving full&#8208;color and white CPL emissions leveraging chirality transmission and amplification from cellulose derivative to achiral helical polymer. Importantly, such chirality transfer displays a dependence on the hydrogen bond accepting ability of solvent, making it effortless to precisely regulate chiral intensity by single or combined solvents. Moreover, the induced chirality in helical polymer is further transferred to the introduced racemic fluorescent dyes, resulting in full&#8208;color and white&#8208;light CPL emissions with a maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and 62.9&#8201;%, respectively. Further spatially separating the chiral and fluorescent components allows inversion of CPL handedness and precise modulation of CPL intensity. Notably, circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and chiral logic gate with multiple information outputs are successfully developed. This work gives an impetus to construct cellulosic chiroptical materials, offering more insights into chirality transfer between biomacromolecules and synthetic helical polymers.

         <title>Engineering Surface Tension of Active Layer Solutions to form Uniform Films on Water Surface for Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Photovoltaic Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicone oil additive is introduced to substantially reduce surface tension of active layer solutions. High net spreading coefficient was achieved, which enabled solution drops to spread into large&#8208;area films on water surface with the help of Marangoni force. Flexible modules with an active area of 32.5 cm2 and a PCE of 14.3% was achieved through the Marangoni force&#8208;assisted coated (MAC) method







Abstract
Fabricating large&#8208;area uniform thin (about 100&#8197;nm) active layer films via solution processing is still challenging to realize efficient scalable organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules. In this work, we report a method to fabricate large&#8208;area active layer films with the help of Marangoni force via engineering the surface tension of their solutions. Silicone oil was first adopted as an additive to substantially reduce surface tension of the active layer solutions from 34.8 to 20.6 mN/m. Large&#8208;area (up to 700&#8197;cm2) thin active layer films formed spontaneously on water by Marangoni force due to the increased surface tension difference between the active layer solution and water. The films were then transferred onto charge transporting layer to fabricate devices. The active layer films fabricated by Marangoni force&#8208;assisted coating (MAC) displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCE), 17.4&#8201;&#177;0.3&#8201;% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, 17.9&#177;0.7&#8201;% for D18:N3 and 16.4&#177;0.3&#8201;% for PM6:QM&#8208;1. Furthermore, large&#8208;area (32.5&#8197;cm2) OPV modules were fabricated based on the MAC method with a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%. This is the first example that MAC method is used to successfully fabricate efficient OPV modules via the surface tension engineering of active layer films with silicone oil used as a low surface tension additive.

         <title>Quantum Chemical Understanding of the O2 Release Process from Nature's Water Splitting Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations reveal that O2 release from nature's water splitting cofactor is initiated by the Mn3&#8722;O5 bond cleavage, without an initial conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8722; group. This pathway is kinetically dominant because of the maximum stability of the rate&#8208;limiting transition state.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis plays a vital role in the supply of energy and oxygen necessary for the survival of biological organisms. The current leading proposal of the O&#8722;O bond formation in photosystem II suggests the coupling between the central &#956;&#8208;oxo (O5) and the additional oxygenic ligand (Ox) of the manganese&#8208;calcium oxide cofactor. However, the subsequent process through which molecular dioxygen is formed and released remains elusive. In this report, quantum chemical calculations reveal that the O2 release process is initiated by the cleavage of the Mn&#8722;O5 bond, without a preliminary conformational change of the peroxide [O5&#8208;Ox]2&#8722; group. Subsequently, the [O5&#8208;Ox] moiety is converted from the superoxide to the weakly bound quasi&#8208;O2 where the Mn&#8722;Ox bond is cleaved, and after a twist of the quasi&#8208;O2 unit, the free O2 is ultimately released. Alternative pathways display significantly slower kinetics, due to the lower structural stabilities of the rate&#8208;limiting transition states. The cause of the difference is associated with the Jahn&#8208;Teller axial orientation and the local ring strain within the Mn cluster. These findings contribute to unravelling the intricate mechanism involved in an important step of photosynthetic oxygen evolution for a deeper understanding of nature's water oxidation catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zinc Halogen Aqueous Battery Exploiting [BrCl2]&#8722; Storage in Ketjenblack by Reconstructing Electrolyte Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance zinc halogen aqueous battery has been developed by creating new [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples, utilizing sophisticated nanopore confinement within a Ketjenblack host and coordination chemistry via reconstructing electrolyte structure, which delivers an impressive discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g|KB&#8722;1 and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg|KB&#8722;1.







Abstract
Halogen redox couples offer distinct merits due to high redox potential and low cost, but they usually suffer from poor reversibility. Here, we report highly reversible [Br2Cl]&#8722;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8722;/Cl&#8722; redox couples via harnessing interhalogen chemistry within nanoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon as a host for zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries. The tunable halogen reactions are facilitated by controllable coordinating chemistry of [ZnCl4&#8208;xBrx]2&#8722; in a hydrated deep eutectic solvent electrolyte comprising ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and choline chloride (C5H14ClNO). In an optimized electrolyte, the KB electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;gKB&#8722;1 or 214&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 when the stored [BrCl2]&#8722; is counted at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.6&#8197;V, and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgKB&#8722;1 or 315&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, when considering the mass of [BrCl2]&#8722; as well. Benefiting from the interhalogen coordination chemistry and KB pore host, the pouch cell delivers an areal capacity of 2.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, storing an energy density of ~80&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of both electrodes. This work offers a new strategy to enhance the reversibility of static aqueous halogen batteries for energy storage applications.

&lt;p&gt;A high-performance zinc halogen aqueous battery has been developed by creating new [Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox couples, utilizing sophisticated nanopore confinement within a Ketjenblack host and coordination chemistry via reconstructing electrolyte structure, which delivers an impressive discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;|KB&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;|KB&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen redox couples offer distinct merits due to high redox potential and low cost, but they usually suffer from poor reversibility. Here, we report highly reversible [Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox couples via harnessing interhalogen chemistry within nanoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon as a host for zinc-based aqueous batteries. The tunable halogen reactions are facilitated by controllable coordinating chemistry of [ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;4-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in a hydrated deep eutectic solvent electrolyte comprising ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and choline chloride (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;ClNO). In an optimized electrolyte, the KB electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 535&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;KB&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; or 214&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; when the stored [BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is counted at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.6&#8197;V, and a record high energy density of 788&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;KB&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; or 315&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, when considering the mass of [BrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as well.

         <title>Highly Entangled Hydrogels by Photoiniferter&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities were synthesized by photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). The resulting hydrogels contain high density of trapped entanglements which impart enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite the vanishingly small crosslinking densities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities by trithiocarbonate photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). Fixing the photoiniferter to crosslinker ratio and gradually increasing the targeted degree of polymerization (DPtarget) allowed for simultaneous control over the crosslinking density and the average molecular weight (Mn) of the primary chains, both below and above the critical molecular weight of entanglement (Mc). Interestingly, a plateau in storage moduli (G&#8217;) was observed for UHMW PDMAm hydrogels with a sufficiently high DPtarget (&gt;5,000), indicating a transition to the entanglement&#8208;dominated regime, with no contribution from crosslinks to the overall modulus, thus indicating the formation of highly entangled hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite their vanishingly small crosslinking densities. Furthermore, even when equipped with cleavable crosslinkers, the UHMW PDMAm hydrogels resist degradation due to dense entanglements which act as transient crosslinks preventing the gels from swelling, while sparse covalent crosslinks help to maintain their structural integrity and avoid chain disentanglement. This approach allows simple synthesis of elastic and tough hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined structure and tuneable contributions from both crosslinks and entanglements.

         <title>Molecular Origin of the Stretchability and Fatigue&#8208;Resistance of Rotaxane&#8208;Based Mechanically Interlocked Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked polymers exhibit various functionalities for promising applications. Notably, while enhanced stretchability and superior fatigue resistance have been primarily attributed to the sliding of rotaxanes, the intrinsic role of mechanical interlocking itself has remained underappreciated. Herein, densely crosslinked SPN and MIN systems are developed to reveal the interlocked architectures as the fundamental molecular mechanisms of mechanical enhancement.







Abstract
Rotaxane&#8208;based polymer networks leveraging host&#8211;guest recognition have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing smart materials. Despite numerous studies on these polymers, their unique mechanical properties are mostly associated with the sliding motion of the macrocycle along the axle, leaving the impact of the presence or absence of interlocked structures on the mechanical performance of materials yet to be directly demonstrated. In this work, we present a densely (pseudo)rotaxane&#8208;based supramolecular polymeric network (SPN) and a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) as model systems to explore how the mechanical interlocking unit dominates the material properties. Specifically, we have achieved a significant transition from SPN to MIN by finely tuning the stopper size, just substituting a methyl with a dimethyl group attached to the phenyl ring. Although their stereochemical structures are similar, a subtle increase in the stopper size can lead to striking improvements in stretchability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. The stopper size&#8208;relevant dethreading behavior, as evidenced by a combined approach of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and rheology, is the underlying molecular mechanism for the difference in the macroscopic mechanical properties. We anticipate that the fundamental understanding gained from this work will advance the development of rotaxane&#8208;based materials with emergent functions and applications.

         <title>Lactate&#8208;Modulating Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial Respiration Block for Tumor Immunosuppression Remodeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;dopped copper nitride (Cu3N&#8722;C) acts as a lactate oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme. C doping enhances n&#8722;&#963;* delocalization of the oxygen lone pair from lactate C&#8722;OH bond, weakening hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H for efficient lactate dehydrogenation, which benefits tumor immunosuppression remodeling. The as&#8208;generated pyruvate is further blocked for influx into mitochondrial respiration via inhibition of PDH complex by Cu3N&#8722;C.







Abstract
Abnormal lactate metabolism in tumor cells leads to immune escape in the tumor microenvironment. Intervening in specific lactate metabolic pathways while blocking downstream pyruvate influx holds great promise for overcoming conventional lactate&#8208;targeted therapy limitations such as short half&#8208;life, insufficient lactate consumption, and pathological microenvironment elasticity. Herein, a nanocatalytic medicine based on carbondoping engineered copper nitride enzyme (Cu3N&#8722;C NE) with enhanced lactate oxidase (LOX) activity was carefully designed. Computational results revealed that the introduction of C favors activation of the hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H bond in lactate by the polarization of adjacent hydroxyl groups, correspondingly facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the desired &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;H groups in lactate via the hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) process. The Cu3N&#8722;C NEs could downregulate lactate levels in tumor cells for robust remodeling of the immunosuppressive microenvironment and further block as&#8208;generated pyruvate to influx into the mitochondrial respiration, achieving lactate homeostasis reprogramming. Our study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of next&#8208;generation lactate&#8208;modulation nanomedicine via heteroatom&#8208;doping and evolution with the additional potential to expedite the industrial production of lactate to pyruvate.

         <title>Noble Gas Provides a Solution to the Synthesis&#8208;On&#8208;Inert&#8208;Surfaces Challenge for Extended Covalent Nanostructures</title>

Noblesse oblige! The noble gas argon can be used to form carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether&#8208;based nanostructures on inert surfaces such as graphite. In contrast to on&#8208;surface synthesis on metal surfaces, this may allow the exploration of novel field&#8208;effect devices.







Abstract
A key milestone in the field of On&#8208;Surface Synthesis (OSS) is the development of generic protocols for covalent coupling on inert surfaces. Typically, metal surfaces are used in OSS, but the strong interactions distort the intrinsic properties of the synthesized nanostructures and therefore compromise their applicability. Inert surfaces, on the other hand, preserve the nanostructures&#8217; unique properties, but present challenges during synthesis: Activation energies are generally higher than on metal surfaces, hence thermally activated coupling on inert surfaces is severely hampered by competing premature desorption of the reactants. Using the coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;mercaptophenyl)benzene (TMB) via carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether bonds, we demonstrate that annealing in a noble gas atmosphere instead of in a vacuum kinetically inhibits desorption. This allows covalent coupling on both inert graphite and even more weakly interacting graphene surfaces. We anticipate generic potential for this approach, with future experiments exploring the expandability of ambient pressure annealing to a portfolio of other coupling protocols.

         <title>Expanding the Molecular Switches Toolbox: Photoreloadable Dithienylethene Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalizing dithienylethene with polycaprolactone creates a robust mechanophore that once activated by UV light, lose its red color under sonication. The thermally&#8208;forbidden ring opening reaction is better mediated when force is applied at the 5,5&#8242;&#8208; positions of the scaffold. Uniquely, the DTE&#8208;polymer conjugates can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic and ultrasound radiation, which makes them reloadable.







Abstract
Molecular switches are often thought of as nanoscopic equivalents to the electrical buttons and knobs ubiquitous in everyday life. However, mechanical force is rarely used to reversibly trigger rearrangements at the atomic scale, due to the difficulty in selectively breaking certain bonds, while keeping others intact. Here, we introduce two new mechanophores based on dithienylethene (DTE), which can be toggled between two states by ultraviolet light and sonication. Attaching various lengths of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) either to the 2,2&#8242; or the 5,5&#8242; positions of the DTE core allowed us to study the kinetics of its mechanochemical cycloreversion. We employed computational methods to understand the root causes of the observed mechano&#8208;regiochemical differences. Lastly, we show that our best performing DTE&#8208;polymer conjugate can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical force.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insight into the Enantioselectivity of (R)&#8208;Selective Styrene Monooxygenases: A Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Proximal and Distal Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of an (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenase (SeStyA) revealed that the sizes of two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312) relative to the C=C bond govern substrate binding orientation by a distinct &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism that determines enantioselectivity. Based on this mechanism, a series of SeStyA variants were engineered to produce both enantiomers with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Group E flavoprotein monooxygenases (GEMs) are well&#8208;known for catalyzing enantioselective epoxidation reactions. However, engineering their enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge, largely due to a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Among these enzymes, (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenases ((R)&#8208;SMOs) stand out due to their unusual enantio&#8208;switch behavior when catalyzing the reactions of p&#8208;substituted styrenes. This unique property provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate the enantiocontrol mechanisms within GEMs. In this study, we resolved the first crystal structure of an (R)&#8208;SMO, SeStyA, derived from Streptomyces. By integrating this structural information with molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified four key residues critical to enantiodivergency: two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312). Strikingly, a &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; mechanism was revealed through saturation mutagenesis, wherein the side&#8208;chain sizes of proximal and distal residues exerted opposing influences on enantioselectivity at the C=C bond. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we successfully engineered SMOs with excellent (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity.

         <title>Identifying the Key Photosensitizing Factors over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Selective Control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; Generation</title>

A photosensitizing MOF molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211; UiO&#8208;4) was constructed by engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for clarifying the relationship between photosensitizing factors and ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 to O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4, demonstrating an effective regulation of ROS generation by modulating photosensitizing factors.







Abstract
The reaction pathway, product selectivity and catalytic efficiency of photo&#8208;oxidation are highly dependent on the specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;), generated via the sensitization of O2 by photosensitizers. Studies on uncovering the role of photosensitizing factors on the selective control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation are significant but remain underexplored. Here, we constructed a photosensitizing metal&#8211;organic framework molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211;UiO&#8208;4) by elaborately engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for modulating photosensitizing factors and elucidating their impact on ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4 by modulating photosensitizing factors. UiO&#8208;2 and UiO&#8208;4 were respectively immobilized in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, achieving gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of phenol and juglone with high purity (&gt;94&#8201;%) via O2&#8901;&#8722; and 1O2 pathway, respectively. Investigations reveal that UiO&#8208;4 with ligand localized excited state and long excited state lifetime contributed to triggering energy transfer to afford 1O2, whereas UiO&#8208;1 with charge&#8208;transfer state and negative reduction potential facilitates charge transfer to produce O2&#8901;&#8722;. This work offers a novel insight into regulating ROS generation by modulating the photosensitizing factors at the molecular level.

An efficient artificial copper&#8208;dependent Michaelase featuring a metal&#8208;binding unnatural amino acid, e.&#8201;g. bipyridyl alanine (BpyA), was optimized through directed evolution and applied in catalytic asymmetric additions of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes. Various chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Moreover, the reaction was performed at preparative scale and the product was used in follow&#8208;up derivatization reactions towards various high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are an attractive approach to achieving &#8220;new to nature&#8221; biocatalytic transformations. In this work, a novel copper&#8208;dependent artificial Michaelase (Cu_Michaelase) comprising a genetically encoded copper&#8208;binding ligand, i.&#8201;e. (2,2&#8208;bipyridin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)alanine (BpyA), was developed. For the first time, such an ArM containing a non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding amino acid was successfully optimized through directed evolution. The evolved Cu_Michaelase was applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes, yielding various &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives, which are precursors for a range of high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds, with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, the evolved variant could be further used in a preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, providing chiral products for diverse derivatizations. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the binding of Cu(II) ions to the BpyA residues and showed that, in principle, there is sufficient space for the 2&#8208;acetyl azaarene substrate to coordinate. Kinetic studies showed that the increased catalytic efficiency of the evolved enzyme is due to improvements in apparent KM for both substrates and a notable threefold increase in apparent kcat for 2&#8208;acetyl pyridine. This work illustrates the potential of artificial metalloenzymes exploiting non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding ligands for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis.

         <title>Full&#8208;Scale Regulation Enabled High&#8208;Performance Sodium O3&#8208;Type Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;scale regulation of O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is achieved through ternary&#8208;lattice&#8208;site doping combined with a perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 surface coating. This strategy optimizes the interlayer structure and establishes a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which further alleviating intrinsic lattice strain, suppressing disordered FeO64+ migration, and mitigating undesirable interfacial reactions. As anticipated, the as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF cathode demonstrates impressive rate capability and excellent cycle durability at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut&#8208;off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero&#8208;elements, synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk multifunctionally full&#8208;scale modified O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 protective layer in situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr&#8722;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&#8722; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na&#8208;TM&#8722;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8208;OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep&#8208;desodiation state. Consequently, as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 2&#8197;C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff&#8208;site and external surface structure for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced durability.

         <title>Zinc(II)&#8208;Enhanced Excimer Probe for Recognition of MDMB&#8208;CA Synthetic Cannabinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific sensing strategy towards MDMB&#8208;CA series synthetic cannabinoids was pioneered upon a novel metal&#8208;enhanced excimer probe, accompanied with a transforming luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to FRET effect before and after detection. The proposed probe exhibited the desirable sensing performances towards MDMB&#8208;CA series with sensitive (ng level), rapid (&lt;5&#8197;s) and specific discrimination of the target from the analogues.







Abstract
Specific recognition with optical responses towards the analytes which are structurally diverse and weak chemical&#8208;active remains a big challenge but is of great significance. Here, a zinc(II) enhanced fluorescent emission probe was developed by conjugated modulating and metal bridging to specifically recognize synthetic cannabinoids (SCs). The transformed luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to fluorescence resonance energy transfer was demonstrated upon the integration of coordination and non&#8208;covalent interactions towards target SCs. As a result, the specific and instant detection of the certain type SCs (MDMB&#8208;CA series) was achieved in complicated sample medium. Hence, we envisage that this work would not only offer a novel recognition strategy for SCs, but also advance the development of the optical sensing probe especially for analyzing the substances with diverse structures and weak chemical&#8208;activity, as well as for fighting against the illicit drugs.

         <title>Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes by Bioinspired Peptide&#8208;Iminophosphorane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of biomimetic peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane superbases were developed and successfully applied to the construction of [2.2]paracyclophanes with planar chirality. In this way, a series of functionalized, pseudo&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized with high enantioselectivity. In further experimental studies, the detailed reaction mechanism underlying this organosuperbase&#8208;catalyzed process was elucidated.







Abstract
Planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes, particularly pseudo&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, are privileged scaffolds for chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis and have widespread applications in materials science. However, catalytic asymmetric approaches for the enantioselective synthesis of pseudo&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel class of peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane organosuperbases to induce planar chirality in spatially stacked [2.2]paracyclophanes. This efficient protocol enables the enantioselective synthesis of a diverse array of structurally distinct pseudo&#8208;gem, pseudo&#8208;ortho, and pseudo&#8208;para [2.2]paracyclophanes, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities via desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. Moreover, the products can be readily diversified through various functional group transformations. Mechanistic investigations provide valuable insights into the unique stereocontrol exhibited by this peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane catalytic system.

Its sensitivity gain enables a reduction of the protein concentration in mixture screens by up to 20&#8208;fold and renders it the experiment of choice for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening campaigns.







Abstract
For initial hit identification in fragment&#8208;based drug design, NMR is one of the preferred methods, with the well&#8208;established ligand screening experiments T1&#961;, waterLOGSY and STD. Here, we present a new, perfect echo&#8208;based experiment with superior binding sensitivity, the PEARLScreen. The sensitivity enhancement is based on longer relaxation delays as well as active exchange broadening, enabled by the perfect echo scheme. This allowed a reduction of the protein concentration by up to one order of magnitude in comparison to the conventional experiments on the same screening setup without losing binding sensitivity. The experiment was tested throughout the whole field range of commercially available spectrometers from 80 to 1200&#8197;MHz, where at the highest field even a reduction of the required protein amount by a factor of 40 is within reach, thanks to larger compound mixtures and enhanced exchange effects. Based on the superior performance already on standard NMR setups, we expect the PEARLScreen to become the standard screening experiment for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening.

         <title>Gold Self&#8208;Assembly on Copper Electrodes Promotes n&#8208;Propanol Formation in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to n&#8208;propanol (29&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) using a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst designed via self&#8208;assembled monolayers for precise surface engineering.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. Among multi&#8208;carbon products, n&#8208;propanol is particularly appealing due to its high energy density (~27 MJ/L) and broad industrial applications. However, achieving high selectivity for n&#8208;propanol remains a formidable challenge, requiring catalysts capable of facilitating complex reaction pathways and avoiding competing side reactions. In this study, we present a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst architecture that is prepared through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) that significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiency for n&#8208;propanol production. Specifically, Cu substrates are modified with cysteamine SAMs to uniformly anchor a Au3+&#8208;dimercaptosuccinate complex, which enable uniform Au electrodeposition. The resulting Cu/Cys/Au electrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.1&#8201;% for n&#8208;propanol at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, representing a significant improvement over conventional Au&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts. Control studies reveal the necessity of both Au and Cu for selective n&#8208;propanol formation, while mixed SAMs with varying cysteamine and propanethiol ratios allow for precise tuning of Au coverage on Cu. These findings underscore the potential of SAM&#8208;based strategies for precise surface engineering, offering a pathway for selective CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Wide Band Gap Germanate with the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response Created by Hypoxic Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KDP, 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical material is one of the core components for modern laser equipment. The second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and optical band gap are two key indicators of such materials. Herein, a wide band gap germanate, Li3(OH)PbGeO4, with the largest SHG intensity has been created successfully by hypoxic strategy via traditional hydrothermal reactions. The cations in this structure all coordinate with oxygen anions at their lowest coordination number, forming polar PbO3 triangular pyramid and noncentrosymmetric GeO4, LiO4 tetrahedrons. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Structural analysis and PAWED calculations indicate that its strong SHG response is due to the synergistic effects from PbO3, GeO4 and LiO4 groups. Furthermore, Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93. Our work not only breaks the record of SHG intensity in germanates but also provides an effective strategy in exploring new inorganic optical functional crystals.

         <dc:description>
Multidentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;derived halogen bond donors show much improved performance in anion binding and in organocatalysis compared to established neutral halogen&#8208;based Lewis acids like polyfluorinated terphenyls. This superior activity is most clearly demonstrated in the catalysis of a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction.







Abstract
Multidentate neutral halogen bonding catalysts based on iodinated icosahedral ortho&#8208;carborane moieties are introduced. Co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;studies, calorimetric measurements, and 1H NMR titrations demonstrate their strong binding to halides and neutral compounds, further underlined by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Thus, their superior Lewis acidity compared to traditional perfluorinated halogen&#8208;bond donors has been shown. The iodocarborane catalysts also outperformed the latter in a halide abstraction reaction and catalyzed a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction, which was previously out of reach for neutral halogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Hydrodisulfuration of Alkenes with Dithiosulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the versatility of dithiosulfonate reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrodisulfuration of alkenes. Salen&#8208;cobalt enables Markovnikov selectivity, while Ni/N&#8208;donor ligand promotes anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Ni/ligand control achieves remote site&#8208;selectivity via chain walking. Mechanistic studies, supported by experiments and DFT, highlight the key roles of dithiosulfonate radical anion and Ni(III)&#8208;SSR intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, we have discovered the versatility of the dithiosulfonate reagent (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) in transition metal catalyzed selective hydrodisulfuration of unactivated alkenes. The hydrodisulfuration displays a unique Markovnikov selectivity with a Salen&#8208;cobalt complex, while an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity is observed when employing a nickel/bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand. Furthermore, precise control over nickel/ligand enables the successful achievement of remote site&#8208;selective hydrodisulfuration for both internal and terminal alkenes via a chain&#8208;walking process. In these processes, silanes are employed as a hydride source. Mechanistic insights into these innovative catalytic systems are also elucidated. Experimental findings suggest that Markovnikov hydrodisulfuration is likely to proceed through radical substitution on dithiosulfonate reagents, while nickel catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity and remote site&#8208;selectivity likely occur via the radical addition of the reductively formed dithiosulfonate radical anion ([ArSO2&#8208;SSR]&#8901;&#8722;) to alkyl Ni(II) species (alkyl&#8208;Ni(II)LnX) and subsequent reductive elimination on Ni(III) intermediate (alkyl&#8211;Ni(III)Ln(X)&#8208;SSR) as the key steps based on DFT calculation analysis.

Experimental findings suggest that Markovnikov hydrodisulfuration is likely to proceed through radical substitution on dithiosulfonate reagents, while nickel catalyzed &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov selectivity and remote site-selectivity likely occur via the radical addition of the reductively formed dithiosulfonate radical anion ([ArSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SSR]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to alkyl Ni&lt;sup&gt;(II)&lt;/sup&gt; species (alkyl-Ni&lt;sup&gt;(II)&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;X) and subsequent reductive elimination on Ni&lt;sup&gt;(III)&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate (alkyl&#8211;Ni&lt;sup&gt;(III)&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(X)-SSR) as the key steps based on DFT calculation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Mass Discovery and High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Fluoroether&#8208;Based Electrolytes for High&#8208;Stability Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning (ML)&#8208;driven workflow was developed for electrolyte screening from vast chemical space through the fast assessment of the high&#8208;voltage stability of electrolytes, solvation ability of solvents to dissolve lithium salts and synthesizability of solvents. Among the recommended candidates, two solvents were synthesized and tested for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMB) application.







Abstract
Developing novel fluoroether electrolytes with high&#8208;voltage stability is an effective strategy to improve the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, the vast chemical space of fluoroether is underexplored due to the absence of effective tools to evaluate the potential used in high&#8208;voltage LMB. Herein, a framework was developed in combination of Voting ensemble algorithms and graph convolution neural network (GCNN), allowing the fast assessment of oxidative stability of non&#8208;aqueous liquid electrolytes, synthesizability of solvents as well as the solvation ability of them to dissolve lithium salts. Potential fluoroether solvent candidates for high&#8208;voltage LMB were screened out from a virtual library comprising 5576 electrolytes constructed by a combination of 1510 solvents and 4 salts. Among them, two fluorinated ethers, 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) propane and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3,12&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5,10,13&#8208;tetraoxatetradecane, were successfully synthesized and showed satisfactory high&#8208;voltage stability, sufficient solvation ability and satisfactory cycling with almost 99.5&#8201;% coulombic efficiency in Li||NMC811 full cell. This work provided an efficient framework for the discovery of solvents with high&#8208;voltage tolerance in a vast structural space prior to experimental synthesis, accelerating the development of advanced electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Residual Monomer&#8208;Induced Side Reactions in Gel Polymer Electrolytes: Unveiled High&#8208;Ni Cathode Failure in Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers the side reaction mechanism and impact of residual monomers in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with systematically controlled unreacted monomer content under different thermal curing (TC) times. Unreacted monomers in GPEs undergo oxidative decomposition during the initial formation process, inducing organic&#8208;rich interphase reconstruction at NCM interfaces, hindering diffusion kinetics and accelerating degradation chemistry.







Abstract
Coupling gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high&#8208;Ni cathodes (NCM) has emerged as a compelling approach for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, capable of circumventing NCM failure modes in liquid electrolytes. However, a detailed origin of capacity decay caused by residual monomers from an uncontrollable curing process has been largely ignored. Here, we report an in&#8208;depth investigation into the side reactions of unreacted monomers within typical GPEs at the NCM cathode interfaces by utilizing multiscale spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. We evaluate conversion rate&#8208;interphase structure correlation, revealing that interfacial evolution is highly dependent on residual monomer content. Specifically, the degradation chemistry in NCM cathodes with thermally cured gel polymer electrolytes (TC&#8208;GPEs) is governed by monomer&#8208;initiated interphase reconstruction, leading to an imbalanced interphase growth mode with organic&#8208;rich species and retarded diffusion kinetics through the electrode. We further reveal that organic ether/ester&#8208;based byproducts, caused by the oxidative decomposition of unreacted monomers during the initial charging step, are the key factor in the acceleration of NCM failure modes. This study elucidates the multiscale fading mechanism in the NCM||GPE system, providing improved insights into interphase issues in typical GPEs and facilitating the further development of long&#8208;life NCM||GPE prototypes for commercial applications.

         <title>Capturing the Progressive Conformational Evolutions of Sterically&#8208;Congested Dihydrophenazines via Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational evolutions of sterically congested dihydrophenazines were successfully captured by freezing distinct conformations in various crystalline forms. This provided direct structural evidence for understanding the photoinduced structural planarization of the polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with a central cyclic 8&#960;&#8208;electron ring.







Abstract
To gain a deeper understanding of the sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolutions of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) luminophores, we strategically freeze distinct conformations by crystallization, allowing to capture the progressive conformational transformations within a DPAC&#8208;based framework by utilizing single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Our focus lies in the innovative modification of DPAC via the synthesis of cyano (CN)&#8208;substituted derivatives DPAC&#8208;nCN (n=1&#8211;4, with n indicating the number of CN groups). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing CN groups modulates electron delocalization and lowers energy barriers, facilitating access to conformational polymorphism within the crystals. Unlike the limited diversity observed in the crystallization behaviour of DPAC, the DPAC&#8208;2CN to DPAC&#8208;4CN derivatives exhibit distinct crystalline forms, with conformational diversity increasing in tandem with the number of CN substituents. Notably, the single DPAC&#8208;4CN molecule features multi&#8208;colored crystals transitioning from blue to red, with the folding angle of the polycyclic dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine ring progressive varying from ~130&#176; to ~172&#176;. Additionally, DPAC&#8208;4CN&#8217;s red crystals with high&#8208;energy planar conformation (~172&#176;) can experience a sudden jumping when subjected to stimuli. This study not only advances the understanding of conformational dynamics in dihydrophenazines but also paves a new way for the development of dynamic crystal materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Synergism&#8208;Enhanced Liquid Metal Locomotion for Unrestricted Circuit Substrate Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal is demonstrated, incubating the method for efficiently and precisely patterning liquid metal over a broad range of substrates, where the gallium redox states&#8208;mediated synergistic electrochemical energy transduction drives the enhanced liquid metal locomotion behaviour.







Abstract
The critical challenge in advancing liquid metal circuits (LMCs) lies in achieving interfacial compatibility with diverse substrates while dynamically balancing fabrication efficiency and quality to ensure robust conductive stability. Here we introduce an electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal (E&#8208;rsLM) that enables the controllable generation of diverse intermetallic bond transition layers (Cu, Au, or Fe&#8208;based) between liquid metal and unrestricted substrate surfaces, applicable in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. It involves enhanced locomotion of the liquid metal, driven by synergistic electrochemical energy transduction from cyclic changes in gallium redox states. Characterized by expansion&#8208;contraction&#8208;expansion, it enables unique self&#8208;propelled bouncing, tuning spreading speed (up to ~26.8&#8197;mm/s) and elongation rate (up to 1192&#8201;%) with a volume of only 80&#8197;&#956;L. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of E&#8208;rsLM fabrication across 30 different substrates, highlighting its versatility. The patterning displays the superimposed efficiency and self&#8208;indicated quality, leading to superior conductivity (with time&#8208;cost savings of 30.7&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;% in heating&#8208;cooling cycles, and a nearly 90&#8201;% reduction in output resistance). The practical viability of these circuits is further showcased by the assembly of integrated circuits, marking a significant step in expanding LMCs applications beyond laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photoredox Catalysis toward Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of phenazine&#8208;based 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different substituent groups were constructed. The interpenetration folds and energy levels of these COFs can be well regulated. Upon irradiation with visible light, these COFs can work as efficient photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high recyclability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a thriving class of photocatalysts in various chemical transformations. However, the utilization of COFs as photoredox catalysts for atom transfer radical polymerization is rarely known. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of phenazine&#8208;based functional 3D COFs with the dia topology. Structural regulation over interpenetration folds and energy levels of COFs was implemented through the substituent effects. These COFs can work as effective photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization. Notably, DADP&#8208;CF3&#8208;COF with trifluoromethyl group exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other COFs, allowing the efficient synthesis of polymers with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high conversion. This work not merely realizes the structural regulation of 3D COFs through substituent effects, but also exhibits brilliant prospects for the utilization of COFs as efficient catalysts in a bunch of challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Ketocarbonyl Compounds with Simple Olefins by Photoredox&#8208;Nickel&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Triple Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel approach involving photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds with simple olefins has been developed. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route to enantioselectively synthesize high&#8208;value molecules featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter from feedstock chemicals, while only consuming photons.







Abstract
Although the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of carbonyl compounds with activated olefins has already been established, extending this methodology to less activated or nonactivated olefins remains a significant challenge due to the polarity mismatch in these ionic processes. An alternative approach involves the activation of the parent carbonyl compounds into electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, which could potentially overcome this limitation. However, the lack of efficient catalytic systems has impeded the wide adoption of this strategy, particularly in realm of the catalytic asymmetric reactions. Here, we present a cooperative triple catalytic system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts to achieve a direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds using simple olefins as alkylating agents. By combining a multifunctional chiral nickel Lewis acid with an iridium photoredox catalyst and a thiophenol catalyst under visible light, we have developed a highly efficient process that is temporally synchronized to facilitate a novel mechanism of electron and hydrogen transfer. This triple catalytic approach enables the intermolecular coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds with both less and non&#8208;activated olefins. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route to enantioselectively synthesize high&#8208;value molecules featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter from feedstock chemicals, while only consuming photons.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational isomerization of the Se&#8208;based donors in a pair of enantiomers has led to multi&#8208;emission of blue, yellow and red phosphorescence. The enantiomers thus showed single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPL) and also exhibited white circularly polarized electroluminescence in white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a color rendering index (CRI) of 82 at CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33).







Abstract
A pair of multi&#8208;emission enantiomers, (R)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ and (S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PSeZ, was designed and synthesized by integrating Se&#8208;induced conformationally isomeric donors with a chiral carbonyl&#8208;containing acceptor into a unified molecular framework. The enantiomers showed white emission with blue, yellow and red multi&#8208;emission bands in solution and film at CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.35) and (0.33, 0.34), respectively. Doped film of the enantiomers achieved a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;%, accompanied by mirror&#8208;image white circularly polarized photoluminescence (WCPPL) signals with a |gPL| value of 2.6&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, the enantiomers also showed white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.33) and EQEmax of 3.1&#8201;%. Notably, this work represents the first single&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;emission WCPL materials and achieved the highest performance for white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule organic materials with phosphorescent properties. Furthermore, leveraging Bragg reflection from dual&#8208;layer cholesteric liquid crystals, the enantiomers achieved |gPL| and |gEL| values of 1.85 and 1.88, respectively, marking the highest reported values for WCPPL and WCPEL to date.

         <title>Facilitating OH* Generation on Atomic Pd&#8211;Cu Dual Sites towards Efficient Glycerol Electrooxidation to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;doped Cu3N hollow nanocubes with Pd&#8208;Cu dual sites were prepared, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Pd atoms located in partial Cu substituent sites facilitate the generation of active *OH and enhance the adsorption of glycerol on adjacent Cu sites, while Pd atoms located in Cu3N unit center could reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C bond cleavage for the rate determining step.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) represents a mild and sustainable pathway to produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as formate. However, the rational design and controlled synthesis of efficient catalysts to achieve highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of glycerol towards formate remains a great challenge. Herein, atomic Pd doped Cu3N hollow nanocubes with Pd&#8722;Cu dual sites were prepared via the unique Kirkendall process, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic GOR activity and selectivity towards formate with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 91.6&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms located in partial Cu substituent sites could facilitate the generation of active *OH and enhance the adsorption of glycerol molecule on adjacent Cu sites, while Pd atoms located in Cu3N unit center could effectively reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C bond cleavage for the rate determining step. Our work provides new insights into the development of well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;site catalysts to boost glycerol electrooxidation to formate.

         <title>Breaking the Limitation of Laminar Flow in Thrombolytic Therapy with Reconfigurable Vortex&#8208;Like Nanobot Swarms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the control of RMF, the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms move along the blood vessel wall toward the venous thrombus, disrupting the laminar flow near the thrombus. The released urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA) is then entrained by the rotating fluid induced by the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms, where it directly acts on the thrombus.







Abstract
Laminar blood flow represents the normal physiological state of blood circulation, but it also acts as a natural physiological barrier for the effective diffusion of drugs to the lesion site. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy in which reconfigurable vortex&#8208;like swarms of magnetic swimming nanobots actively disrupt the laminar flow to deliver drugs in a manner similar to how bacteria seek food. The drug was released from the cavity of biodegradable, submicron pentosan flask&#8208;like nanobots, aggregates as the dynamic rotating drug fluid under a rotating magnetic field. The vortex&#8208;like nanobot swarm successfully overcame the laminar barrier near the thrombus in a rat inferior vena cava stenosis thrombosis model, which was observed by ultrasound blood flow imaging. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of nanobots swarm for enhancing thrombolytic efficacy through drug aggregation after breaking the laminar flow was further confirmed in a rat deep vein thrombosis model. This bionic active targeting approach overcomes the laminar flow barrier and restricts the release of drugs by the swarm&#8208;induced vortex fluid to facilitate targeted drug delivery, which is expected to be an innovative method to enhance drug delivery efficiency.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation as a Design Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

The &#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation gives the covalent organic good solid fluorescence performance, and its electron cloud shape is like a lotus flower. High&#8208;quality solid fluorescence can be used for sound sensor parts. TOC Figure is obtained by combining the Chinese classical lifted lotus flower and the flying sky of playing flute.







Abstract
Realizing efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represents a persistent and fundamental challenge in materials science, hindering their application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. Herein, a transformative strategy leveraging &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation is introduced to enhance the fluorescence properties of COFs. The incorporation of a methyl group into a pyrene&#8208;based COF monomer yields an unprecedented fluorescence quantum yield increase of more than 100&#8208;fold, accompanied by significantly enhanced optoelectronic performance. This enhancement arises from &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation, which redistributes electron density, converting pyrene from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and facilitating efficient electronic transitions. Additionally, a COF&#8208;based fluorescent acoustic sensor, fabricated via electrospinning, demonstrates real&#8208;time speech pattern recognition when integrated with machine learning algorithms, showcasing potential in language&#8208;assistive technologies. This study pioneers the exploration of hyperconjugation in COFs, offering a new paradigm for the precise modulation of optoelectronic properties and bridging fundamental research with real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Lithium and Sodium Conducting Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first example of ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs) crosslinked by aliphatic spiroborate linkages. These ICANs are straightforward to synthesize and exhibit promising ion conductivity at elevated temperature. Moreover, these materials are closed&#8208;loop recyclable and rapidly reprocessable. Their potential application as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated through the fabrication of a prototype device.







Abstract
Within the past two decades, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a novel class of dynamically crosslinked polymers, combining the benefits of thermosets and thermoplastics. Although some CANs with charged side chains have been reported, CANs with negatively charged backbones remain very limited. The integration of permanent charge into the backbones upon their formation could open up important new applications. Here, we introduce a series of aliphatic spiroborate&#8208;linked ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs), representing a new category of dynamic ionomer thermosets. These ICANs were synthesized using a catalyst&#8208;free, scalable, and environment&#8208;friendly method. Incorporating lithium or sodium as counter cations in these networks yielded promising ion conductivity without the need of plasticizers. The dynamic nature of the spiroborate linkages in these materials allows for rapid reprocessing and recycling under moderate conditions. Furthermore, their potential as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated in a device that maintained robust conducting performance under extreme physical deformation, coupled with effective self&#8208;healing properties. This research opens new possibilities for future development of dynamic ionomer thermosets and their potential applications in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode/electrolyte interface processes involve two key steps: ion desolvation and ion transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the determining factor of which one affects the performance of hard carbon is limited by the microstructure of the hard carbon. In a more disordered state, solvation and SEI work in concert; however, as the degree of order increases, the role of the solvation structure becomes more pronounced than that of the SEI.







Abstract
In alkali metal&#8208;ion battery systems, the electrolyte enables being decomposed on the electrode surface to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. In principle, a thin, uniform SEI film facilitates the enhancement of the performance of the cell. Herein, we successfully distinguish the effects of desolvation behavior and SEI process on the kinetic behavior of hard carbon (HC) electrodes by adopting the strategy of switching the electrolyte interface model to modulate the properties of SEI film. Our findings reveal that although the SEI film is generally responsible for significantly affecting the HC's capacity, the equally crucial desolvation process must not be overlooked. The trade&#8208;off between the two factors is found to be determined by the structural features of HCs. Specifically, in the context of a more ordered HC, the desolvation of ions emerges as the rate&#8208;limiting step for Na+ transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface, exerting a more pronounced effect rather than the SEI. Thus, a close correlation was established between the SEI, solvation structure effects, hard carbon structure, and electrode performance. This linkage is thereof fundamental for the strategic design of electrolytes and the targeted enhancement of cell performance.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Agent for Synergistic Tumor Therapy: Co&#8208;Activation of Photochemical&#8208;Biological Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic composite nanotherapeutic agent (HAP@BMPns) was developed for synergistic tumor therapy. HAP@BMPns is triggered by the acidic tumor environment to release the photosensitizer BMP and Ca2+, thereby synergistically activating photochemical&#8208;biological effects through the production of O2&#8722;&#8901; based Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions and mitochondrial damage caused by Ca2+ overload, ultimately achieving a synergistic effect for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;mode photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on photochemical reactions is limited by the tumor microenvironment, which reduces the ablation efficiency for solid tumors. Making it vital to seek ways to improve the tumor therapeutic effect. Based on this, we propose a dual&#8208;mode intelligent nanotherapeutic system (HAP@BMPns) based on photochemical&#8208;biological effects. HAP@BMPns is composed of an acid&#8208;responsive high&#8208;calcium biomimetic nanomaterial (HAP) and photosensitizer (BMP), which can spontaneously activate photochemical (Type&#8208;I PDT) and biological effects for synergistic cancer therapy. HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca2+ and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type&#8208;I PDT of BMP under two&#8208;photon (800&#8197;nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4&#8201;%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.&#8201;e. BMP (5.0&#8197;&#956;M) and HAP (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9&#8201;% and 63.0&#8201;% respectively). Therefore, this dual&#8208;mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid&#8208;triggered photochemical&#8208;biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect. We hope that this design strategy can provide guidance for the design and development of a tumor therapeutic platform.

HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type-I PDT of BMP under two-photon (800&#8197;nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4&#8201;%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.&#8201;e. BMP (5.0&#8197;&#956;M) and HAP (41.6&#8197;&#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9&#8201;% and 63.0&#8201;% respectively). Therefore, this dual-mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid-triggered photochemical-biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect. We hope that this design strategy can provide guidance for the design and development of a tumor therapeutic platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Prolonged Cycling Stability of Aluminum&#8208;Selenium Batteries Using Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte prepared via diluting the ionic liquid electrolyte with non&#8208;solvating 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzene co&#8208;solvent facilitates the deposition of Emim+ and Al&#8722;Cl species for the formation of a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Al&#8722;Se batteries. This prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides and their deposition on Al metal anode, ultimately enhancing the cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Al&#8722;Se batteries (ASeBs) with high theoretical specific capacity and discharge voltage are promising energy storage devices. However, the detrimental shuttle effect occurring in conventional ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) challenges their development. Herein, a thicker cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is constructed via employing locally concentrated IL electrolytes (LCILEs) to overcome these issues. It is demonstrated that LCILEs facilitate the incorporation of Emim+ into the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and, meanwhile, more Al&#8722;Cl species deposits are observed in the CEI. The formed CEI effectively prevents the dissolution of poly&#8208;selenides, inhibiting their related parasitic reactions. These result in ASeBs, employing the LCILE, to deliver a specific discharge capacity of 218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while the cell using the neat ILE only maintains 38&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same conditions. Moreover, an Al&#8722;S cell operated in LCILEs reaches 578&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, which is also significantly better than 317&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the neat ILE. This study provides an LCILE&#8208;based strategy to reinforce the CEI in order to suppress the shuttle effect, realizing Al&#8208;chalcogen batteries with better performance.

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with a Boron&#8208;Doped Zigzag/Armchair Topology: A Boron&#8208;Edging Strategy for Organic Narrowband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

Aiming at challenging boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), three large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology were synthesized. The as&#8208;obtained molecules show intriguing topological and electronic structures as well as optoelectronic properties, e.g. inhibited excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and narrowband emission characteristics.







Abstract
Control over molecular topologies and/or heteroatom doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their electronic structures and achieve desirable physical properties. Herein, this work challenges boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended PAHs. We successfully synthesized a series of large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology through one&#8208;pot multifold Scholl cyclization reaction. Two of them possess the desired C3&#8208;symmetric and unexpected unsymmetrical C54B3 nanographene frameworks, respectively, thus illustrating triply boron&#8208;edging manipulations of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Detailed studies reveal that such boron&#8208;doped edge topology significantly inhibits their excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and thereby produces narrowband emission characteristics. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of their fluorescence spectra are as small as 12&#8211;18&#8197;nm, which have never been observed for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and are among the smallest values reported for organic emitters. Their solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) display extremely narrowband electroluminescence, and additionally, the obtained FWHM of only 23&#8197;nm represents the narrowest one reported for red OLEDs.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy to Transform Cationic Polymers for Efficient and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy was used to transform low&#8208;cost and ineffective cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), which robustly delivered mRNA to the spleen in vivo. PAPs loaded with mRNA encoding model antigen could induce robust anti&#8208;tumor response, suggesting their great potential for vaccine application. Additionally, by incorporating different helper lipids, PAP&#8208;based four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) specifically delivered mRNA to the lung and liver, respectively. This strategy advances both the polymer&#8208; and lipid&#8208;based mRNA delivery systems.







Abstract
The progress of mRNA therapeutics underscores the imperative demand for the development of targeted delivery systems. While cationic polymers hold promise as genetic vectors, their poor in vivo efficacy and numerous variants highlight the urgent need for a universal functionalization strategy to bolster their delivery capabilities. Here, we present a versatile strategy to transform low&#8208;cost commercial cationic polymers into phospholipidated and alkylated polymers (PAPs), enabling efficient and organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery in vivo. This straightforward post&#8208;functionalization method can be readily broadened to a diverse array of existing cationic polymers, enhancing their cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release functionalities. Consequently, PAPs facilitate up to 30,500&#8208;fold higher mRNA expression compared to their unmodified counterparts in vivo. Notably, the one&#8208;component PAPs enable spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery, with their vaccine application validated in a mouse melanoma model following intravenous administration. Better still, PAPs can synergize with different helper lipids to formulate four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), achieving respective lung&#8208; and liver&#8208;specific mRNA delivery. Noteworthy is that these organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery systems significantly outperform previous polymer and LNP benchmarks. This transformation strategy for cationic polymers represents a generalized methodology to give highly effective mRNA carriers, highlighting substantial potential for clinical translation of mRNA therapies with organ&#8208;targeting requirements.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Inert Weakly Solvating Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Micro&#8208;Sized Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) is designed to enable stable cycling of micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes in subzero environments. Through elaborate regulation of competitive coordination, the TIWSE preserves a temperature&#8208;independent anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and exhibits weak solvent coordination, enhancing the capacity retention and rate capability of &#956;Si anodes. This work addresses low&#8208;temperature challenges of high&#8208;energy &#956;Si||Ni&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes with high specific capacity are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but face significant volume changes during cycling. Constructing anion&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by electrolyte engineering is considered a viable strategy for stabilizing &#956;Si anodes. However, at low temperatures, temperature&#8208;dependent anion&#8208;dominated solvation and sluggish Li+ desolvation hinder cyclability and capacity retention. Here we introduce a unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) that preserves the anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and has weak solvent coordination capability, enabling stable cycling of &#956;Si anodes in subzero environments. The crucial role of NO3&#8722; anions with a high donor number in regulating competitive coordination in TIWSE is unveiled. As a result, &#956;Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with TIWSE demonstrate impressive capacity retention of 91.8&#8201;% at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 80.8&#8201;% at 30&#8201;&#176;C after 100 cycles, along with a high specific capacity of 137.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C. Furthermore, a 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell of Si&#8722;C||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 shows remarkable cycling stability with 89.3&#8201;% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 77.3&#8201;% retention at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating the practical applicability.

     alt="Temperature-Inert Weakly Solvating Electrolytes for Low-Temperature Lithium-Ion Batteries with Micro-Sized Silicon Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique temperature-inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) is designed to enable stable cycling of micro-sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes in subzero environments. Through elaborate regulation of competitive coordination, the TIWSE preserves a temperature-independent anion-dominated solvation sheath and exhibits weak solvent coordination, enhancing the capacity retention and rate capability of &#956;Si anodes. This work addresses low-temperature challenges of high-energy &#956;Si||Ni-rich lithium-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost-effective micro-sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes with high specific capacity are promising for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries but face significant volume changes during cycling. Constructing anion-derived, inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase by electrolyte engineering is considered a viable strategy for stabilizing &#956;Si anodes. However, at low temperatures, temperature-dependent anion-dominated solvation and sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation hinder cyclability and capacity retention. Here we introduce a unique temperature-inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) that preserves the anion-dominated solvation sheath and has weak solvent coordination capability, enabling stable cycling of &#956;Si anodes in subzero environments. The crucial role of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions with a high donor number in regulating competitive coordination in TIWSE is unveiled. As a result, &#956;Si||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cells with TIWSE demonstrate impressive capacity retention of 91.8&#8201;% at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 80.8&#8201;% at 30&#8201;&#176;C after 100 cycles, along with a high specific capacity of 137.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 6&#8197;C. Furthermore, a 1-Ah pouch cell of Si&#8722;C||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows remarkable cycling stability with 89.3&#8201;% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 77.3&#8201;% retention at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating the practical applicability. This work highlights the importance of solvation chemistry in addressing low-temperature challenges and offers new insights into high-energy &#956;Si-based lithium-ion batteries operating under harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Cr Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>

An oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction activity and proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance has been discovered for the first time.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) are promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Their ORR activity and selectivity are significantly affected by the heteroatoms that coordinate the central metal atoms. Previous reports found that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs promoted a 2e&#8722; ORR rather than the 4e&#8722; ORR that is more desirable for fuel cells. Herein, we report for the first time that oxygen&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs are capable of promoting the 4e&#8722; ORR in acid media. We prepared a Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst with the central Cr atom coordinated by two O atoms. The Cr(acac)&#8208;NC catalyst not only exhibits excellent ORR activity and stability in acid media, but also delivers high proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance comparable to N&#8208;coordinated M&#8208;SACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Cr&#8722;O2 moieties located on the zigzag edge of the carbon support are the ORR&#8208;active sites.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;resistant organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials are achieved by fabricating the microphase separation structure in block copolymers via synergizing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases. After the self&#8208;assembly, the hydrophilic blocks were surrounded by hydrophobic blocks to mitigate water ingress. The resulting copolymers exhibit a long phosphorescent lifetime and decent water&#8208;resistant properties, demonstrating potential applications in afterglow display and information encryption.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have demonstrated significant potential for various applications due to their unique luminescent properties. However, most conventional RTP polymers are vulnerable to moisture and water, which can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network within the polymer and accelerate the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons of phosphors, leading to the quenching of RTP. Herein, we present a universal strategy to achieve water&#8208;resistant RTP polymers by designing amphiphilic block copolymers with microphase&#8208;separated structures. Specifically, the rigid hydrophilic phase, which is rich in carboxyl groups, forms hydrogen bonds that suppress non&#8208;radiative decay of the chromophores, resulting in RTP. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic phase effectively prevents water molecules from penetrating and disrupting the rigid polymer network. By combining the functions of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, the resulting RTP copolymers exhibit good water&#8208;resistant properties. Even after being immersed in water for one month, the copolymers maintain a green afterglow with a lifetime of 629&#8197;ms. Moreover, the water&#8208;resistant nature of these RTP polymers has also been demonstrated in potential applications of afterglow displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This research offers valuable insights into the design of RTP materials with stability in aqueous environments and broadens the scope of their potential applications in diverse settings.

         <title>Defect Imide Double Antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) as Potential Solar Cell Absorber Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonothermal method enabled the synthesis of antiperovskites with NH2&#8722;&#8208;groups instead of N3&#8722;&#8208; ions, which introduces vacancies and replaces the octahedral unit by square&#8208;pyramidal units. These imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi) showcase a new route to structurally engineer antiperovskites with cation&#8208;deficiencies. Their direct band gaps have been confirmed and density functional theory calculations revealed good band dispersion, transport properties and optical properties suitable for solar cell absorber materials.







Abstract
An abundance of oxide, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have been explored, demonstrating outstanding properties, while the emerging nitride perovskites are extremely rare due to their challenging synthesis requirements. By inverting the ion type in the perovskite structure, the corresponding antiperovskite structure is obtained. Among them, ternary antiperovskite nitrides X3AN (X=Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg; A=As, Sb) have recently been identified as exhibiting excellent optoelectronic properties. To explore the unrealized composition space of nitride perovskites, the ammonothermal method was applied, yielding three new layered quaternary imide&#8208;based defect&#8208;antiperovskites, namely AE5AsPn(NH)2 (AE=Ca, Sr; Pn=Sb, Bi). These new compounds feature distorted square&#8208;pyramidal coordination around the imide&#8208;group (Ca5NH). Layers with Ca2+ vacancies are found with an alternating As3&#8722; and Pn3&#8722; (Pn3&#8722;=Sb3&#8722;, Bi3&#8722;) coordination along the A&#8208;site, forming a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure. All three AE5AsPn(NH)2 compounds show suitable direct band gaps within the visible light spectrum. Density functional theory calculations reveal favorable band dispersion, as well as transport and optical properties, especially along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, demonstrating their 3D character of electronic transport. The narrow tunable direct band gaps and favorable charge carrier properties make AE5AsPn(NH)2 promising candidates for solar cell absorber materials.

         <title>Improving Light&#8208;Responsive Efficiency of Type II Porous Liquid by Tailoring the Functionality of Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is designed to fabricate type II light&#8208;responsive porous liquid (LPL) with enhanced responsive efficiency by tailoring the functionality of host with long&#8208;chain alkyl ligand in addition to responsive ligand. The new host is dissolved in a polyethylene glycol&#8208;based ionic liquid, which leads to the production of LPL with controllable gas adsorption behavior and shows potential for propylene/propane separation.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A strategy is designed to fabricate type II light-responsive porous liquid (LPL) with enhanced responsive efficiency by tailoring the functionality of host with long-chain alkyl ligand in addition to responsive ligand. The new host is dissolved in a polyethylene glycol-based ionic liquid, which leads to the production of LPL with controllable gas adsorption behavior and shows potential for propylene/propane separation.

         <title>Dual Defects&#8208;Induced Iron Single Atoms Immobilized in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Hollow BiOBr Microtubes for Low&#8208;Barrier Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>

The dual vacancies of oxygen and bromine induce the formation of catalytically active Fe single atoms with coordinatively unsaturated FeO5 configuration in hollow MOF&#8208;derived BiOBr microtubes, which benefits the efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts with precise coordination environment and high separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is critical yet challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic nitrogen reduction. Herein, we design and construct a defective photocatalyst featuring Fe single atoms immobilized in hollow BiOBr microtube using a plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where the Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework is used as sacrificial template. The dual vacancies of oxygen (VO) and bromine (VBr) are created in the BiOBr microtube and induce the formation of coordinatively unsaturated FeO5 configuration, where four oxygen atoms are from [Bi2O2]2+ units and one oxygen atom is located in the VBr. Specially, the hollow catalyst with dual defects and FeO5 moiety exhibits 1.4 and 2.2 times higher ammonia production activity than another two VBr&#8208;featuring catalysts with coordinatively saturated FeO6 configuration and unsaturated FeO4 configuration, respectively. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the optimized catalyst with the FeO5 configuration reduces the energy barrier of electron transfer from Fe 3d orbitals to antibonding orbitals of N2 molecules, which favors the formation of a key *NNH intermediate in the N2 fixation reaction and the resultant efficient ammonia production.

         <title>Weakening Solvent&#8208;Solute Interactions for High&#8208;Efficiency Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was proposed to weaken the interaction between solvents and perovskite precursors through halogen ions. This leads to the improved efficiency of the optimized screen&#8208;printed device and mini&#8208;module to 21.8&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2) and 18.95&#8201;% (12.6&#8197;cm2), respectively. This work opens a new avenue to improve the performance of screen&#8208;printed PSCs.







Abstract
Screen printing has emerged as a leading candidate for industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. However, strong solvent&#8208;solute interaction in conventional formulations accelerates the preferential crystallization of perovskites at points, hindering the progressive phase evolution from point to line to plane. In this work, we introduced halogen ions to weaken solvent&#8208;solute interactions, achieving the reduced Pb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O coordination strength counterbalanced by enhanced Pb&#8722;I bonding interactions. This weakened interaction delays formamidinium iodide participation in rapid phase transitions to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide, enabling controlled crystallization kinetics. The optimized screen&#8208;printed perovskite solar cells demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.8&#8201;% for 0.05&#8197;cm2 devices and 18.95&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cm&#215;5&#8197;cm mini&#8208;modules (active area: 12.60&#8197;cm2). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23&#8211;24&#8201;% PCEs for both blade&#8208;coating and spin&#8208;coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25&#8211;30&#8201;&#176;C, 35&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment and Oxygen Electroreduction Reaction Performance Correlationship of Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic polymers with finely tuned linkage microenvironment and Fe&#8208;N4 site electron spin states are prepared to elucidate structure&#8211;property relationships towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Systematic in situ electrochemical and structural characterizations attributed the improved ORR kinetics of the electron&#8208;withdrawing benzophenone substituted catalyst with high&#8208;spin Fe&#8208;N4 moieties to the high accessible site density and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (PFePc) offer well&#8208;defined sites, rendering them ideal model systems to elucidate structure&#8211;property relationships towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but have struggled to achieve improved catalytic activity due to uniform electron distribution of iron center and difficulty in molecular&#8208;level structure design. Although rationally linkage microenvironmental regulation is an effective approach to adjusting activity, the underlying fundamental mechanism is incompletely understood. Herein, systematic DFT calculations and experimental investigation of PFePc analogous reveal that the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing benzophenone linkage into the PFePc backbone (PFePc&#8208;3) drives the delocalization of Fe d&#8208;orbital electrons, downshifts the d&#8208;band energy level, thereby tailoring the key OH* intermediate interaction, demonstrating enhanced ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V, a high mass activity of 21.43&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 2.18&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal that linkage regulation can induce a 3d electron with high spin&#8208;state (t2g3eg2) of PFePc&#8208;3, significantly accelerating the ORR kinetics. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry further highlight the rapid kinetics of PFePc&#8208;3 to the high accessible site density (6.14&#215;1019&#8197;site&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism.

A C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction between the substrates has been developed that can afford mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted products depending on the reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations reveal the important role played by the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex in this reaction. The method was used for the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse and novel NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.







Abstract
Here, we report a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction. Due to the strong intermolecular noncovalent interaction, an essential electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex is formed, confirmed solidly by absorption spectra, 1H NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The EDA complex lowers the activation barrier (Ea=9.17&#8197;kcal/mol) and facilitates the formation of the C&#8722;C bond, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step revealed by H/D and 12C/13C KIE studies. Kinetic investigations reveal that the reaction is a second&#8208;order reaction. Furthermore, high&#8208;level theoretical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted products were obtained by varying the reaction conditions. A series of structurally diverse and novel second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores based on benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8217;]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) were synthesized by utilizing this coupling reaction.

         <title>&#8220;Self&#8208;Catalysis&#8221; Acceleration of Carrier Transport in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Mortise&#8208;Tenon Stacking</title>

         <dc:description>
Four Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) with the same main chain but different stacking patterns have been synthesized as models to explore stacking engineering in the conversion of light energy. The zigzag&#8208;stacked COFs were shown to generate self&#8208;built electric field that mutually promotes interchain carrier transport, and introducing appropriate mortise&#8208;tenon structures between the chains enhances this effect and regulates light absorption.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are promising in the field of photonic energy conversion. However, most efforts have been concentrated on the design of ligand geometric structures and chemical bonding relationships, while understanding the impact of stacking methods on photonic energy conversion remains a significant challenge. In this work, four COFs (1D&#8208;COF, 1D&#8208;MeCOF, 1D&#8208;tBuCOF and 2D&#8208;COF) with the same main&#8208;chain structure but different stacking methods are designed and synthesized, using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as a model reaction. Mortise&#8208;tenon stacked 1D&#8208;MeCOF exhibits far superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance to other stacking methods, and it maintains high efficiency and stability in natural seawater systems. Extensive characterization demonstrates that such a unique mortise&#8208;tenon stacking structure of 1D&#8208;MeCOF inhibits interchain slippage, enhances &#960;&#8208;stacking, and maximizing light absorption capabilities. Furthermore, unidirectional carrier transport characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional structure can generate a strong photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;built electric field, which acts as &#8220;self&#8208;catalysis&#8221; to accelerate carrier transport. This work provides an effective design strategy and mechanistic insights on the stacking engineering of photonic energy conversion materials.

         <title>Crystallization Thermodynamics Regulation of 1.85&#8197;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient and Stable Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with high Br content features rapid crystallization, resulting in poor film quality due to the uncontrolled intermediate phases. However, a diammonium salt additive can improve film uniformity and crystallization of perovskite effectively, reducing phase segregation and voltage loss in perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;band gap perovskite with adjustable band gaps can be integrated with organic solar cells to form tandem solar cells (TSCs), thereby surpassing the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, increasing Br content to elevate the band gap above 1.8&#8197;eV complicates crystallization, leading to inferior film quality and defects due to the unmanageable evolution of intermediate phases. Surface passivation improves crystallization but hard to moderate the inhomogeneous component distributions and defects in the bulk phase. Here, we introduce a diammonium salt as an additive to regulate the homogeneity and crystallization of perovskite film, eliminating the low&#8208;dimensional intermediate phase for orientated crystallization of 1.85&#8197;eV perovskite, resulting in efficient wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.379&#8197;V and operational stability remaining 85&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after illumination for 1200&#8197;h. Furthermore, perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.03&#8201;% and a high Voc of 2.108&#8197;V, one of the highest Voc for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.

         <title>Synergy from the Stepped Hollow FeHCFe Nanocubes and the Dimorphic Polypyrrole for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Water Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination of hybrid capacitive deionization was realized via synergy from the stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes and the dimorphic polypyrrole (PPy). The FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved an remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate in both batch&#8208;flow and single&#8208;pass mode, along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials.







Abstract
Saline water desalination serves as an important route to increase freshwater supply, while capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technique to tackle this issue. To boost the successful application of CDI, development of advanced electrode materials is vital. Herein, we innovatively designed and synthesized a sophisticated Prussian blue/dimorphic polypyrrole composite for the hybrid CDI (HCDI). Specifically, the nanoparticle&#8208;like polypyrrole (PPy) in situ distributed on the surface of stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes, while the coexisting nanotube&#8208;like PPy interconnected the discrete stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes. The introduction of PPy nanoparticles/nanotubes promoted both electron and ion dynamics, and improved the electrochemical activity of FeHCFe. Meanwhile, the FeHCFe nanocubes with concave stepwise architecture on each side offered large accessible contact area for electrolyte, reduced Na+ migration path, improved tolerance for lattice expansion, and optimized redox sites for Na+ storage. Through such unique structural design and synergistic combination, the FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved a remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials. Moreover, the treated solution can meet the drinking water standard within 6&#8197;min via the use of six tandem HCDI cells. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the mechanism of Na+ capture process and provided a fundamental understanding of the rapid Na+ migration and large Na+ storage capability. This study provides insights into ration design of superior electrode materials for high&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination.

The immobilization of nanosized small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a novel strategy to achievehigh capacity, long lifespan, and superior rate capability. The N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation creates additional active sites and strengthens &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of SMOCCs nanoparticles on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring high theoretical capacities are promising cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but facing challenges in cycling stability and rate performance owing to their high solubility in organic electrolytes and low conductivity. Herein, we propose a novel architecture wherein nanosized SMOCCs with N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation are uniformly immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This approach leverages the N&#8208;heterocycles to create additional active sites and strengthen &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of nanosized SMOCCs on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration. As a demonstration, we synthesize a composite material using dipyrido[3&#8217;,2&#8217;:5,6;2&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;10,21&#8208;dione (DQDPD) as the active component, which exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in LIBs, including an ultrahigh capacity of 505&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, exceptional cycle stability with 82&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability of 290&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1. Our approach, which integrates molecular engineering and nanostructure design, provides a novel paradigm for simultaneously realizing high capacity, long lifespan, and rapid rate capability in SMOCCs.

         <title>Broadband&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition and Thermoinduced Cycloreversion&#8208;Powered Dynamic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion of pyrenylvinylpyrylium salt elicit bending of its crystals by exposure to visible light and straightening by heating. This example represents a novel concept of energy conversion where the energy stored in the bonds of the strained cyclobutane ring is converted to work of dynamic molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanically responsive dynamic molecular crystals are central to developing efficient, rapid, and robust materials capable of conversion of light energy to mechanical work. However, unlike some other, mainly photochromic molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems, solids that undergo photoinduced [2+2] cycloaddition have not been thoroughly explored for powering reversible actuation, despite that this reaction system carries potential in the heavily strained bonds of the cyclobutane ring. In this study, we propose that broadband&#8208;light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition can be used to store energy and actuate dynamic organic crystals by irradiation with visible light. The prototypical material, pyrenylvinylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (1&#8211;PVPyL), undergoes a topochemical [2+2] cycloaddition induced not only by ultraviolet radiation (365&#8197;nm) but also by monochromatic green light (532&#8197;nm), red light (620&#8197;nm) and broadband visible light in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) manner, causing its crystals to bend. The crystals effectively act as energy depots, where the reverse deformation can be initiated by heating and the stored energy is released via thermal cycloreversion reaction. Given the ubiquity of the [2+2] cycloaddition in the solid state, the current study invites the development of new dimeric MOST architectures that utilize sunlight for energy storage and thermal triggers for energy release. Within a broader scope, this approach provides a platform for fabrication of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven crystal actuators capable of harnessing sunlight.

         <title>Direct Upcycling of Degraded LiCoO2 Towards High&#8208;Performance Cathodes via a Multifunctional Organic Lithium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) structure, the deficiency of Li ions severely causes cracks in the particles, leading to a slow diffusion rates and low efficiency of electrons and Li ions. The upgraded lithium cobalt oxide (LRD&#8208;LCO) was obtained by mixing the D&#8208;LCO with lithium lignosulfonate for direct regeneration by one&#8208;step annealing; the LRD&#8208;LCO structure gets integrated and smooth due to Li ions replenishment and doping by elemental Na and S, and the electron and ion transfer rates are enhanced dramatically.







Abstract
Direct recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono&#8208;functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li&#8722;L). Li&#8722;L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D&#8208;LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and retention rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 10&#8197;C with a maximum cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. More importantly, life&#8208;cycle analysis shows that the upcycling method performs optimally in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as economic benefits, providing a prospective pathway for the large&#8208;scale application of recycling spent batteries.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial Topological Nanostructures Enhances In Vivo Efficacy of PCSK9 Inhibitory Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformable inhibitory peptide (TIP) based on Pep2&#8208;8 targeting PCSK9 forms in situ artificial topological nanostructures (ATNs), enhancing stability and binding affinity. TIP demonstrates 18.7&#8208;fold increased PCSK9 affinity compared to Pep2&#8208;8 in vitro. In high&#8208;fat diet mouse models, TIP elevates hepatic LDLR levels (2.0&#8208;fold) and reduces LDL&#8208;C and TC, presenting a promising antibody alternative strategy.







Abstract
Optimizing the stability and affinity of peptides in vivo is critical for their development as alternatives to approved monoclonal antibodies. In recent years, efforts in academia and industry have focused on modifying Pep2&#8208;8, a classical antagonistic peptide targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), to enhance its specificity and affinity. However, developing effective PCSK9 inhibitory peptides remains challenging, especially given the limited examples of their successful in vivo applications. Here, we designed transformable inhibitory peptide (TIP) against PCSK9 based on the modular structure of Pep2&#8208;8. Upon encountering PCSK9, TIP undergoes in situ self&#8208;assembly at the epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domain A (EGF&#8208;A) binding domain of PCSK9 to form artificial topological nanostructures (ATNs). The ATNs not only enhance peptide stability and prolong in vivo retention time but also strengthen PCSK9 binding through multivalent synergistic effects. We demonstrate that compared to Pep2&#8208;8, TIP forms ATNs which increasing its binding affinity for PCSK9 by approximately 18.7&#8208;fold in vitro. In high&#8208;fat diet mouse models, TIP significantly increase hepatic LDLR levels (2.0&#8208;fold) and reduced LDL&#8208;C and TC levels. We envision that the in situ formation of ATNs by peptides enhances in vivo stability and affinity, which offering an approach for development as antibody alternatives in clinical.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable phase transformation electrode (PTE) was constructed, which enabled the NaK anode to process in near&#8208;solid to overcome the assembly difficulties of liquid electrodes, and then in&#8197;situ phase transformed to liquid within the battery for working to inhabit dendrites growth.

Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity, the deposition of solid alkali metals can trigger dendrites growth, causing safety risk, capacity and life decay. While liquid NaK alloy is dendrite&#8208;free, their fluidity may cause leakage or even short circuit. In this work, a novel controllable phase transformation strategy was proposed enabled NaK anode to be processed in near&#8208;solid and work in liquid, effectively overcoming the challenges of dendrite formation and leakage. Specifically, a near&#8208;solid anode was fabricated by liquid metal (LM)&#8208;assisted mechanochemistry reaction, which can be easily shaped and integrated into batteries without leakage risk. Then self&#8208;accelerated phase transformation continues within the battery, driven by an LM&#8208;mediated in&#8197;situ replacement reaction, converts the near&#8208;solid electrode into liquid state and enabling dendrite&#8208;free operation. For the first time, a cylindrical cell with liquid NaK alloy anode was successfully matched and demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances. This innovation not only enhances safety but also advancing the practical application of liquid metal electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Aqueous Zr/HfIV&#8208;Oxo Cluster Speciation and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometal Zr/Hf oxocluster assembly is demonstrated by solution and solid&#8208;state&#160;spectroscopies. The atomic&#8208;level mixing highlights their nearly&#8208;identical chemistry that challenges separations. However, divergent ligand lability yields a solubility gradient and explains a key difference that allows separation. Hf&#8208;selective precipitation from water introduces a &#8216;greener&#8217; method for this Zr/Hf separation that is crucial for the nuclear industry.







Abstract
Many industrial separations of chemically&#8208;similar elements are achieved by solvent extraction, exploiting differences in speciation and solubility across aqueous&#8208;organic interfaces. We recently identified [OM4(OH)6(SCN)12]4&#8722; (OM4, M=Zr/HfIV) tetrahedral oxoclusters as the main species in industrial processes that produce nuclear&#8208;grade Zr and Hf from crude ore. However, isostructural/isoelectronic OM4&#8208;oxoclusters do not explain selective extraction of Hf into the organic phase. Here we have characterized heterometal Hf&#8722;Zr clusters in solution and the solid&#8208;state yielding key information about their fundamentally different chemistry that engenders separation. Clusters prepared with both ammonium (industrial process) and tetramethylammonium counter cations revealed that 1) heterometal clusters (instead of a mixture of homometal clusters) assemble, and 2) Hf&#8208;rich OM4 selectively precipitates over Zr&#8208;rich OM4, providing a separation process that does not require an organic extractant. Mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, solution&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state 17O NMR evidence both mixed&#8208;metal speciation and selective Hf&#8208;precipitation. Raman spectroscopy suggests greater Zr&#8208;ligand lability than Hf&#8208;ligand lability, consistent with higher aqueous solubility of Zr&#8208;rich clusters, enabling both extraction and precipitation&#8208;based separation. Fundamentally, we also identify a key difference between these chemically similar elements that has enabled diversification of Zr&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry over the last decade, while Hf&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry lags.

         <title>Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meticulous deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir species onto P islands on In2O3 nanosheets demonstrates exceptional ethanol selectivity and yields in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The specific coordination of the Ir center with the P islands not only alters the electronic structure of the Ir center, optimizing the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules as well as their C&#8722;C coupling ability but also the P islands exhibit excellent H2 dissociation ability compared to the Ir single atomic site in Ir1/In2O3.







Abstract
The thermocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to ethanol has attracted significant interest because ethanol offers ease of transport and substantial value in chemical synthesis. Here, we present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol achieved by precisely depositing single&#8208;atom Ir species on P cluster islands situated on the In2O3 nanosheets. The Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst achieves an impressive ethanol yield of 3.33&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 914&#8197;h&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;MPa (H2/CO2=3&#8201;:&#8201;1) at 180&#8201;&#176;C, nearly 8 times higher than that of the unmodified Ir1/In2O3 catalyst. Additionally, at a more industrially relevant pressure of 5.0&#8197;MPa, the TOF of the Ir1&#8208;Px/In2O3 catalyst can reach up to 2108&#8197;h&#8722;1, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Combined in situ characterization and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogenation process is significantly enhanced by the Ir1&#8208;Px entities. Specifically, the Ir atom facilitates CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling, while the surrounding P island exhibits exceptional H2 dissociation ability. These three steps have been found crucial for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This discovery opens new opportunities for the regulation of the microenvironment of current catalysts by providing essential chemical functionalities that enhance intricate and complex reaction processes.

         <title>Boosting C&#8208;O Bond Cleavage and Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Activity via Enriched In&#8208;Plane Sulfur Vacancies in Single&#8208;Layer Molybdenum Disulfide</title>

A dual&#8208;template method was developed to synthesize MoS2 catalysts with tunable layer numbers. Single&#8208;layer MoS2 demonstrates superior activity in the RWGS reaction, outperforming Multi&#8208;layer MoS2. Comprehensive characterization techniques combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancies enhance C&#8722;O bond cleavage, exhibiting intrinsic activity 5.8 times higher than that of edge vacancies.







Abstract
The reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to the production of valuable chemicals through CO2 utilization. However, challenges persist with the rapid deactivation and insufficient activity of catalysts. Herein, we developed a soft&#8208;hard dual&#8208;template method to synthesize layered MoS2 using inexpensive and scalable templates, enabling facile regulation of sulfur vacancies by controlling the number of layers. The concentration of in&#8208;plane vacancies keeps increasing with the reduction of MoS2 layer number, contributing to 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over single&#8208;layer MoS2 and a stable performance over 300&#8208;hour reaction at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of CO reached 35.7&#8197;gCO&#8197;gcat&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, outperforming most current catalysts. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancy sites endowed enhanced production of CO via direct dissociation of CO2, showing an intrinsic activity of above 5.8 times higher than that of edge sulfur vacancy sites. The rate&#8208;limiting step was shifted from C&#8722;O cleavage in edge to sulfur vacancy regeneration in plane with a lower energy barrier. Our findings exemplified the specified design and synthesis of MoS2 for high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction through the effective manipulation of distinct vacancy sites, shedding light on their potential industrial application.

         <title>A Versatile Carbonylative Approach to Ureas and Carbamates through Light Activated Nickel Catalyzed Formation of Aliphatic Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile carbonylative approach to prepare aliphatic ureas and carbamates has been developed. The reaction functions with an earth abundant nickel catalyst to generate electrophilic isocyanates from C(sp3) halides, azide and carbon monoxide. The in situ addition of nucleophiles offers a unique and modular method to apply the efficiency of carbonylations to the synthesis of broad array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance in drug design.







Abstract
We describe the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed route to prepare aliphatic isocyanates via carbonylation chemistry. Unlike thermal reactions, where the affinity of Ni(0) for carbon monoxide has traditionally limited its use in carbonylations, mechanistic studies suggest that visible light excitation of a Xantphos&#8208;bound nickel catalyst can enable a radical pathway for the carbonylation of alkyl halides, while the CO&#8208;bound nickel drives the formation of a reactive acyl azide product for rapid Curtius rearrangement. Coupling this transformation with subsequent nucleophilic reactions has opened a unique and modular pathway to apply carbonylations to the synthesis of an array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance to drug design.

         <title>Modulated &#960;&#8208;Bridge of Thioxothiazolidine Derivatives for Passivating Bilateral Interfaces and Grain Boundaries in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

By designing &#960;&#8208;bridge groups of dye molecules and leveraging the molecular extrusion effect, we achieve effective interface passivation of dyes on perovskite solar cells. This approach enhances interfacial transmission characteristics, thereby improving both performance and stability.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as the predominant approach for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) dyes with tailored configurations have proven to be a viable and effective strategy for passivating defects and optimizing interfacial contacts. In this study, we present two asymmetrical D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes, designated as TZR and TNR. These dyes are designed and synthesized with identical hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting backbones but feature distinct &#960;&#8208;bridge groups. They are incorporated into the precursor solution of PbI2 to facilitate in situ passivation of both interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) during the formation of the perovskite film (two&#8208;step process). These dyes effectively penetrate both buried and upper interfaces, allowing for the passivation of defects originating from the GBs, and both interfaces. This significantly reduces defects while enhancing charge transport properties. Notably, the &#960;&#8208;bridge composed of benzo[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazole in TZR contains unpaired electrons from nitrogen and sulfur atoms. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11&#8201;% is achieved. This performance significantly surpasses that of TNR&#8208;based and pristine devices, achieving PCEs of 24.47&#8201;% and 22.88&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in the stability of the unencapsulated device, attributed to the exceptional hydrophobicity of the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes. This study offers valuable insights into achieving high&#8208;performance PSCs through careful molecular design.

         <title>Unlocking Enhanced Catalysis Stability in Acidic Oxygen Evolution: Structural Insights for PEM Applications under High&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>

La&#8208;RuO2@TM composite catalyst not only exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability in the acidic OER but also demonstrates considerable potential for application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. By incorporating La elements, the intermolecular interactions within the catalyst were effectively modified, optimizing the adsorption states of the reaction intermediates and thereby reducing the energy barrier of the reaction. These improvements not only enhanced catalytic efficiency but also increased the catalyst&#8216;s durability, effectively preventing metal leaching and the loss of lattice oxygen.







Abstract
In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that demonstrate high current density and stability are essential. Herein, we synthesized La&#8208;doped RuO2 (La&#8208;RuO2@TM) nanorod composite catalysts in situ on titanium mesh (TM) using a one&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method. La&#8208;RuO2@TM displays excellent catalytic performance (1.533&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability, showing no significant degradation in performance over 450&#8197;hours of operation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the formation of the La&#8208;O&#8722;Ru local structure modulates the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, alleviates metal (Ru) leaching, and reduces oxygen loss, significantly enhancing the material&#8216;s durability in acidic OER. The PEM electrolyzer utilizing La&#8208;RuO2@TM operates at 1.815&#8197;V with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining stable performance for 120&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights for designing efficient and durable acidic OER catalysts.

Copper hydrides featuring cavities, AuCu24&#8208;dppp nanoclusters, reveal the catalytic active unit Cu3H3, elucidating the role of lattice&#8208;hydrogens mechanism in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products. The AuCu24&#8208;dppp clusters efficiently reduce CO2 into deeply reduced products, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 54.5&#8201;% &#8211; comprising 41.9&#8201;% for C2H4 and 12.6&#8201;% for EtOH &#8211; while demonstrating exceptional stability.







Abstract
Copper is the most efficient and practical electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) to give multicarbon (C2+) products, but the mechanism by which such products are formed &#8211; though known to involve lattice&#8208;hydrogens &#8211; remains elusive, and the selectivity of the reaction is poor. Herein, we report the synthesis of [AuCu24(dppp)6H22]+, a copper hydride nanocluster bearing exposed Cu3H3 units in specific surface cavities, and our use of it to study the mechansim and selectivity of the reduction of CO2 to C2+ products. Results of in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations showed that these Cu3H3 units can effectively lower the energy barrier to the formation of the *COCOH intermediate, which allowed the competition between the C1 and C2 pathways to be elucidated. Isotope labeling experiments and catalyst recrystallization studies corroborated the theoretical simulations, identifying the lattice&#8208;hydrogen (H&#8722;) in the Cu3H3 active unit as being indispensable for the formation of C2H4. The molecular design guidelines which this work has facilitated constitute a new approach towards the of copper&#8208;based catalysts that convert CO2 to C2+ products based on lattice&#8208;hydrogen engineering.

         <title>Multichannel Photon Stimulated C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Reduction in a Mixed Water/Acetonitrile Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically combines NAMD and DFT to explore CO2RR on Co@BP, revealing high selectivity for HCOOH (solvent&#8208;free) and CH2CH2 (solution), with the optimal mixed water/acetonitrile (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) solvent enhancing C2+ formation, while under the light multichannel photons promote CHO* coupling for C2 intermediates, emphasizing solvent effects on carrier dynamics and product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Designing effective photocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a precise understanding of the dynamically photocatalytic mechanism under real conditions (e.g. solvent, light field). Herein, we coupled ab&#8208;initio non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation to theoretically reveal the detailed dynamic process for C&#8722;C Coupling under light field on Co&#8208;supported monolayer black phosphorus (BP) catalyst Co@BP. Specially, Co@BP features excellent property for photocatalyst: high stability, long&#8208;lived photogenerated carriers and stronger reducing ability. Thermodynamically, it shown that a dramatic difference in catalytic properties with 99.99&#8201;% selectivity for HCOOH in solvent&#8208;free condition (Ea=0.29&#8197;eV) and 99.34&#8201;% selectivity for CH2CH2 in solution (Ea=0.33&#8197;eV). Slow&#8208;growth based MD simulation results uncover that mixed solvent of water/acetonitrile (H2O/ACN) is beneficial for the formation of C2+ product and the optimal ratio H2O/ACN (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) mixture solvent for the conversion of CO2 to CH2CH2. Under light irradiation, we found that multichannel photons enable adsorbed CHO* to couple with CHO species diffusing from nearby active sites, further forming C2 intermediates in solution. This work highlights the importance of the reaction medium on the photogenerative carrier dynamics and offers a strategy to regulate product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>Elucidating the Biosynthesis and Function of an Autoinducing Peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the biosynthetic pathway of Ca&#8208;AIP, an accessory gene regulator (Agr)&#8208;type autoinducing peptide in Clostridium acetobutylicum. Two CAAX metalloproteases and one signal peptidase were identified to be responsible for the second processing step in Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. By manipulating Ca&#8208;AIP levels, we demonstrate its significant effect on butanol production.







Abstract
Clostridia produce autoinducing peptides (AIPs) regulated by the accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, playing a critical role in intercellular communication. However, the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory functions of clostridial AIPs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we employed chemical quantification, genetic investigations, and in vitro reconstitution experiments to elucidate the native Ca&#8208;AIP in Clostridium acetobutylicum, a prominent industrial producer of acetone, butanol, and ethanol. Our findings identified a signal peptidase (Cac1760) and two CAAX metalloproteases (Cac0077 and Cac2478) as key players in N&#8208;terminal cleavage, while AgrB was found to be essential for C&#8208;terminal processing during Ca&#8208;AIP biosynthesis. Notably, overexpression of agrBD led to a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement in Ca&#8208;AIP formation, which corresponded with an increase in butanol production from 12.5 to 14.9&#8197;g/L, while preserving vegetative cell morphology. The direct involvement of Ca&#8208;AIP in both butanol production and maintenance of cell morphology was further validated through exogenous supplementation. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the biosynthesis of AIPs and propose a promising strategy for optimizing microbial processes in industrial applications.

         <title>An Azo Polymer with Abundant Active Sites and Extended Conjugation as a Stable Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel azo polymer (PTAP) with high site density and extended conjugated structure. The azo groups not only facilitate long&#8208;distance delocalization of &#960; electrons, but also act as an active center for the two electrons transfer to increase site density. The improved charge storage efficiency, excellent anti&#8208;solubility and rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer of PTAP endow zinc&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity, excellent rate performance, and remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing stable cathodes with high capacity and rapid redox kinetics is pivotal for aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A huge challenge lies in balancing the density of active sites and electronic conductivity of organic cathodes. Herein, an azo polymer from 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene&#8208;tetraone (PTAP) possessing high active components and extended conjugated structure was achieved. The extended conjugated system linked by the azo groups facilitates extensive electron delocalization and a low band gap, which endows the PTAP with enhanced electronic conductivity reaching 4.26&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1. The azo groups themselves serve as active centers for two&#8208;electron transfer, leading to a significant increase in the density of redox&#8208;active sites and charge storage efficiency. Moreover, strong intramolecular interactions and unique solvation structure bolster the anti&#8208;solubility of PTAP. Consequently, PTAP&#8208;based ZOBs exhibited high reversible capacities and rate performance, delivering 442.45&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining 248.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a ZOB showed remarkable long&#8208;term stability after cycling over 900&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies further revealed that multi&#8208;step coupling of carbonyl and azo groups accompanied by the Zn2+/H+ dual&#8208;ion insertion is responsible for rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer in PTAP. This work provides new insight into the rational design of advanced organic cathodes for high capacity and long life ZOBs.

         <title>Chemoselective Functionalization of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Allylic Ethers: Enantioconvergent Access to sec,tert&#8208;Vicinal Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel dual photoredox/nickel catalytic system that enables chemo&#8208; and enantioselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers through the generation of nucleophilic &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates. This methodology establishes a versatile platform for constructing highly functionalized homoallylic sec, tert&#8208;vicinal diol frameworks, demonstrating exceptional stereocontrol (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee), broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with diverse substrates.







Abstract
While enantioenriched alcohols are highly significant in medicinal chemistry, total synthesis, and materials science, the stereoselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with two adjacent stereocenters remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a dual catalysis approach utilizing photoredox and nickel catalysts to enable the unprecedented chemoselective functionalization of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds in allyl ethers instead of cleaving the C&#8722;O bond. The resulting allyl&#8208;Ni intermediates can undergo coupling with various aldehydes, facilitating a novel enantioconvergent approach to access extensively functionalized homoallylic sec,tert&#8208;vicinal diols frameworks. This protocol exhibits nice tolerance towards functional groups, a broad scope of substrates, excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggested that allyl&#8208;NiII acts as the nucleophilic species in the coupling reaction with carbonyls.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 17/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is substantially enhanced by the precise deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir on P islands constructed on In2O3 nanosheets. In their Research Article (e202422744), Tsz Woon Benedict Lo and co&#8208;workers report the significant enhancement of ethanol production performance by constructing P islands with excellent hydrogen dissociation capabilities. This facilitates CO2 activation and C&#63743;C coupling at Ir sites and In2O3, thereby boosting the overall catalytic efficiency of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.

A trade&#8208;off (represented by the seesaw in the cover picture) between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation is linked to the structural feature of hard carbon for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202425507). In a more disordered state, desolvation and the SEI work in concert. The desolvation process is progressively enhanced with increasing structural ordering.

A precise strategy for tuning defective structures in two&#8208;dimensional catalysts was developed by Yanqiang Huang, Xiong Su, Xin Shang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202422953). By employing a soft&#8211;hard dual&#8208;template approach, single&#8208;layer MoS2 with enriched in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancies was synthesized. These vacancies significantly promote C&#9472;O bond cleavage, resulting in remarkable catalytic performance in the reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <title>Bimodal Ionic Conduction through Polymer Films due to Nano Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview revisits the phenomenon of nano&#8208;confined ion conduction through polymer films. Ions diffuse through polymer films in two distinct modes depending on the nano&#8208;structure and free space for the passage of hydrated or partially hydrated ions. The size of pathway and how it compares to the size of hydrated ion determines whether ions must shed water from the solvation shell which in essence governs the mode of ionic conduction.







Abstract
Kinetic and selectivity of ionic conduction through polymer films is a key factor in the function of many systems including membrane technology, energy devices, sensors, and corrosion. Typically, the ionic conduction is accelerated by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. However, counterintuitively, polymer films with very high electrochemical impedance demonstrate the opposite effect, i.&#8197;e. ionic conduction slows down by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. This bimodal nature of ionic conduction was discovered five decades ago and yet the mechanism has remained poorly understood. This minireview explains the long&#8208;standing anomaly through the lens of recent advances in nano&#8208;confinement electrochemistry. Emerging evidence shows that changes in solvation shells occurs due to the size of the channel through which ionic diffusion takes place. These solvation shells can significantly affect the mobility of ions, their interactions with functional groups of the polymer, and the overall conductivity of the electrolyte. At dimensions only a few nanometers, partially hydrated ions form stronger bonds with polymer slowing down the ionic conduction. Increasing ionic strength will add ion&#8208;pairing interactions further reducing ions mobility. The interplay of solvated ions, polymer chemistry, and ionic content offer an explanation for the anomalous bimodal ionic conduction.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly using metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst, has received considerable attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into this valuable fuel. This Perspective outlines the best practices that to provide robust and convincing evidence that CO2 is the source of CH3OH in the photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalysts, has garnered significant attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into a valuable fuel and chemical feedstock. Numerous studies in the literature report the successful formation of CH3OH from photocatalytic CO2 reduction, sometimes supplemented with sacrificial agents, with claims substantiated by isotopic labelling measurements. However, in this Scientific Perspective, we note that much of the existing evidence has not been obtained under sufficiently rigorous experimental conditions to conclusively confirm the formation of a highly reactive product like CH3OH from the chemically stable CO2 molecule. This Scientific Perspective outlines best practices designed to provide robust evidence for CH3OH formation in photocatalytic processes, which could be instrumental in clarifying the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and accelerating the development of this technology toward practical applications.

         <title>Au(I)&#8208;, Au(II)&#8208;, Au(III)&#8208;Fluoride Complexes: Synthesis and Applications in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III) are summarised. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several developments of these complexes with a range of supporting ligands, which has enabled their reactivity to be studied. Herein, these advances are highlighted, organised by the oxidation state of Au and supporting ligand.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of organometallic gold&#8208;fluoride complexes in oxidation states of Au(I), Au(II), and Au(III), up to and including 2024, are reviewed herein. Despite the flourishing field of gold catalysis, these complexes had long been elusive due to their instability. A widespread interest in C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F coupling reactions has resulted in several reports of these complexes in recent years. The use of a variety of supporting ligands have facilitated access to these complexes, which has allowed their reactivity to be further studied and understood, thereby laying the ground for future reaction development. This review highlights these advances, organised by the formal oxidation state of the gold centre and the supporting ligand.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The process of Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (pCO2RR) into valuable chemicals is a contributing step to a sustainable future. Perovskites have high light absorption capacity in the visible spectrum, and reduction in dimensionality from 3D to 2D changes the structural and chemical properties. The review focuses on unfolding the unique properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Perovskites that make them favorable photocatalysts. The motive is to highlight and discuss their recent advances in pCO2RR using solid&#8208;vapor and liquid&#8208;solid methods, along with a basic structural discussion. This review also emphasizes innovative material design strategies and catalysis developments in 2D perovskites to enhance pCO2RR.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of Carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals is one of the most promising approaches to addressing the CO2 emission problem. However, several issues still need to be resolved to increase the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Perovskites possess superior light absorption capacity, tunable band gaps, high defect tolerance, and diverse dimensionality. Among them, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are more stable under photocatalytic conditions and have exciting excitonic characteristics compared to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites.&#160;2D perovskites have unique physical and chemical properties, such as high stability, polaron formation, quantum well structures, and high exciton binding energies, which remain underexplored for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (pCO2RR). Tuning these properties is easier in 2D perovskites than in 3D perovskites by varying the layer thickness and spacer cations. Therefore, 2D perovskite photocatalysts are emerging as promising materials for reducing CO2 into valuable products. This review discusses the classification and synthesis methods of 2D perovskites, the unique properties that make them favorable for photocatalysis, and recent advances in applying 2D perovskites for pCO2RR by monitoring the operational methodology. It also emphasizes the potential for future developments in photocatalysis using 2D perovskites.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene vs. Thiophene &#8211; Chiral Adsorption and Unidirectional Rotation on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single NHC molecules carrying a thiophene (NHCiPr&#8722;T) and a bromo (NHCiPr&#8722;Br) substituent are investigated by STM on the Au(111) surface. Both derivatives adsorb flat on the surface and are bound to a gold adatom via the carbene. NHCiPr&#8722;T is anchored to Au(111) via the sulfur atom, thus allowing unidirectional rotation by voltage pulses with the STM tip. In comparison, NHCiPr&#8722;Br shows lateral displacement by voltage pulses.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are highly effective ligands for anchoring functional organic molecules to metal surfaces and nanoparticles, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers. However, their adsorption on surface is difficult to predict and control, and there is an ongoing debate on the geometry of NHC derivatives on gold surfaces and on the role of gold adatoms. We present two single molecules based on a benzimidazole NHC, one equipped with a thiophene substituent, and the other ending with a Br atom. By low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we show that both molecules adsorb planar on Au(111) and are chiral on the surface. Our results indicate that in both cases a complex between NHC and a gold adatom is formed. Upon voltage pulses with the STM tip, both complexes move excited by inelastic tunneling electrons. For the derivative with thiophene, we observe a stepwise 60&#176; unidirectional rotation around the S atom. The direction of rotation is determined by both the chirality and the position of the applied pulse. On the contrary, the NHC derivative without thiophene moves laterally on the surface.

     alt="N-Heterocyclic Carbene vs. Thiophene &#8211; Chiral Adsorption and Unidirectional Rotation on Au(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single NHC molecules carrying a thiophene (NHC&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&#8722;T) and a bromo (NHC&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&#8722;Br) substituent are investigated by STM on the Au(111) surface. Both derivatives adsorb flat on the surface and are bound to a gold adatom via the carbene. NHC&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&#8722;T is anchored to Au(111) via the sulfur atom, thus allowing unidirectional rotation by voltage pulses with the STM tip. In comparison, NHC&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&#8722;Br shows lateral displacement by voltage pulses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbenes are highly effective ligands for anchoring functional organic molecules to metal surfaces and nanoparticles, facilitating the formation of self-assembled monolayers. However, their adsorption on surface is difficult to predict and control, and there is an ongoing debate on the geometry of NHC derivatives on gold surfaces and on the role of gold adatoms. We present two single molecules based on a benzimidazole NHC, one equipped with a thiophene substituent, and the other ending with a Br atom. By low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we show that both molecules adsorb planar on Au(111) and are chiral on the surface. Our results indicate that in both cases a complex between NHC and a gold adatom is formed. Upon voltage pulses with the STM tip, both complexes move excited by inelastic tunneling electrons. For the derivative with thiophene, we observe a stepwise 60&#176; unidirectional rotation around the S atom. The direction of rotation is determined by both the chirality and the position of the applied pulse. On the contrary, the NHC derivative without thiophene moves laterally on the surface. Adsorption, binding to gold atoms, and motion are discussed with the support of density functional theory calculations and image simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction Enabled by Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction was realized through a synergistic catalysis strategy by merging visible light and chiral Lewis acid, affording enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;amino &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones with high enantioselectivity and good functional group tolerance. The mechanism studies demonstrated a stereoselective radical coupling process.







Abstract
Classical aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light&#8208;induced catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino ketones containing a gem&#8208;difluorine moiety. The mechanistic studies including radical trapping experiment, NMR experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance experiment, cyclic voltammetry experiment and spectroscopic analysis rationalized the reaction process.

         <title>Reactivity and Magnetic Coupling of Triangulene Dimers Linked via para&#8208;Biphenyl Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangulene dimers linked by one or two para&#8208;biphenyl units were synthesized on Au(111). STM, non&#8208;contact AFM, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet magnetic exchange coupling for Dimer 1 (ES&#8208;T=15&#8197;mV), influenced by the dihedral angles of the two para&#8208;biphenyl units. Dimers 2&#8242; with an ES&#8208;T=6.6&#8197;mV were obtained from a more flexible precursor equipped with one para&#8208;biphenyl linker.







Abstract
Triangulene and its homologues are promising building blocks for high&#8208;spin low&#8208;dimensional networks with long&#8208;range magnetic order. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of coupled triangulenes, key parameters such as the number of organic linking units or their dihedral angles remain scarce, making further studies crucial for an essential understanding of their implications. Here, we investigate the synthesis and reactivity of two triangulene dimers linked by two (Dimer 1) or one (Dimer 2) para&#8208;biphenyl units, respectively, on a metal surface in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum environment. First&#8208;principles calculations and model Hamiltonians reveal how spin excitation and radical character depend on the rotation of the para&#8208;biphenyl units. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the successful formation of Dimer 1 on Au(111). Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements resolve the twisted conformation of the linking para&#8208;biphenyl units for Dimer 1. On the contrary, the inherent flexibility of Dimer 2 induces the planarization of the para&#8208;biphenyl, resulting in the spontaneous formation of two additional five&#8208;membered rings per dimer connected by a single C&#8722;C bond (Dimers 2&#8242;). Furthermore, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic (S=0) coupling of the observed dimers, underscoring the critical influence of dihedral angles and structural flexibility of the linking units in &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic nanostructures.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Assisted Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Unsymmetric Internal Alkynes by Scandium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 17, April 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;assisted regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetric internal alkynes including homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and amines with hydrosilanes has been achieved by using half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst, providing an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized silylalkenes with high regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes with hydrosilanes is the most straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient method for the synthesis of silylalkenes. However, the hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes often encounters regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity challenges. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes bearing heteroatom functional groups with hydrosilanes by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst. This protocol offers an atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of heteroatom (O, S or N)&#8208;functionalized multisubstituted silylalkenes from a variety of internal homopropargyl thioethers, ethers and tertiary amines and hydrosilanes, featuring 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and excellent regio&#8208; and syn&#8208;stereoselectivity (&gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 r.r. and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 syn/anti). The mechanistic details have been elucidated by control experiments and isolation and examination of some key reaction intermediates. It was revealed that an interaction between the heteroatom (O, S or N) in the internal alkynes and the Sc center was critical for achieving the unprecedented high selectivity.

         <title>Interface Engineered Electrolyte Design Strategy for Ultralong&#8208;Cycle Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries over Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is the direction of development for the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the suboptimal ionic conductive properties exhibited by the electrolyte, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites due to the deposition of inhomogeneous Li+ and the potential safety hazards caused by unstable interfaces have seriously affected the cycle life of the battery at extreme temperatures. Herein, a fluoropolymer&#8208;containing plastic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based electrolyte (FPCE) has been developed by means of a structural engineering process, with the objective of optimizing the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The integration of solvent structure simulation and experimental results demonstrates that FPCE regulates Li+ transport, promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of the LiF&#8208;rich inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid SEI, and enhances the overall stability of the battery. Consequently, FPCE assists in preserving stable LFP|FPCE|Li cells cycling, with 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 C and an average capacity decay rate of merely 0.00448% per cycle. Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cells demonstrate the capacity to operate stably within the temperature range of &#8208;10 to 80 &#176;C. This study provides a valuable strategy for the design of wide&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorine&#8208;free Organic/Inorganic Interphase for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of robust solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) has proved effective in mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions of zinc (Zn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes. Fluorinated SEIs, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional electrochemical stability and high Zn2+ conductivity. However, the formation of such SEIs typically relies on the use of fluorine (F)&#8208;containing precursors, which inadvertently raise environmental and biological concerns because they show high resistance to degradation in natural environments. Herein, we develop an F&#8208;free organic/inorganic hybrid SEI for aqueous Zn batteries using a low&#8208;cost N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (NAG) electrolyte additive. The NAG additive not only modulates the solvation structure of Zn2+ but also preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode to promote the in situ formation of a robust organic (Zn chelates)/inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI layer, thereby enhancing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and Zn plating/stripping reversibility. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling over 6500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8210;2, a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 1 mA cm&#8210;2, and greatly extended cycling stability in full cells (up to 2000 cycles). Our electrolyte design paves a promising avenue towards practical Zn batteries that combine performance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and eco&#8208;friendliness.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescent Iridium(III) Phenanthrolinedione Complexes as Lifetime&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Probes for Wash&#8208;Free Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging of Cellular Labelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic bioorthogonal probes are crucial tools in biomedical research, which enables non&#8208;invasive wash&#8208;free imaging of specific biomolecules in living systems. Lifetime&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal probes represent another promising and attractive alternative, offering the potential for real&#8208;time wash&#8208;free visualization of bioorthogonal labelling processes via photoluminescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). However, their widespread application is limited by the lack of suitable lifetime&#8208;responsive probes. Herein, a series of phosphorescent iridium(III) phenanthrolinedione complexes were reported. Intriguingly, upon bioorthogonal reaction with an &#945;&#8208;angelica lactone derivative, the complexes exhibited remarkable emission responses in three distinct manners, which were found to correlate with the different emissive excited states of the complexes. Crucially, two of the complexes maintained similar emission intensity but exhibited significant emission lifetime elongation during labelling reactions, which facilitated simultaneous and discriminative visualization of the reacted and unreacted probes in cellular imaging without the need for washing steps. One of the complexes was used for organelle targeting and specific protein labelling through bioorthogonal reactions in living cells. The intracellular probe transportation and labelling dynamics were visualized and analyzed using PLIM. This work highlights the unique potential of lifetime&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes as powerful chemical tools for live&#8208;cell imaging and unveiling the spatiotemporal dynamics of biomolecules during bioorthogonal reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;driven Interconversion of Pyridine Dicarbanion&#8208;bonded Ag13 Nanocluster Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent screening is pivotal in the optimization of reaction conditions for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. However, to date little is known about the role of solvent effects in driving in situ structural evolution of metal&#8208;containing species towards polynuclear organometallic cluster intermediates and determining their reactivity. We herein isolate two distinct thirteen&#8208;membered silver cluster isomers, Ag13&#8208;A and Ag13&#8208;M, in acetone and methanol, respectively. Significantly, we demonstrate the interconversion of these isomers facilitated by solvent manipulation, revealing a novel aspect of organometallic nanoclusters. Mechanistic studies on the solvent&#8208;driven Ag13&#8208;A to Ag13&#8208;M transformation reveal a low activation energy of 22.39 &#177; 0.81 kcal mol&#8208;1 and a positive activation entropy, which together with theoretical investigations substantiate that the isomeric transformation involves counter anion dissociation, subsequent twisting of peripheral pyridine dicarbanion ligands, and eventual re&#8208;coordination of the counter anions. The observed differences in thermal stability and reactivity between two isomers are attributed to variations in Ag&#8208;Ag interactions and surface ligand arrangements, underscoring the critical role of solvent selection in affecting the whole organic transformation through in situ formed clusters. These findings demonstrate a new perspective on solvent dependency in metal&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations, foreseeing the necessity of considering organometallic cluster intermediates in solvent screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atomic Hybrid Glasses for Near&#8208;Infrared II Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing demands for modern information communication and storage necessitate the development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active optical waveguides. However, achieving efficient NIR emission with minimal optical loss remains a critical challenge. Herein, we present a new class of rare earth single&#8208;atomic hybrid glasses, synthesized via bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, as a solution to these limitations. By harnessing the ultralong phosphorescence of Nd3+ doped complex glasses, these materials achieve NIR&#8208;II emission extending to 1.32 &#956;m with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ~5.7%, setting a new record among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rare&#8208;earth based complexes in the NIR&#8208;II region. This exceptional performance stems from the efficient sensitization of Nd3+ ions in hybrid glass, with a phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency of 93.55%. Furthermore, these transparent and flexible hybrid glasses trigger optical waveguiding in Eu3+&#8208; and Nd3+&#8208;doped microstructures, enabling ultralow&#8208;loss coefficients of 0.978 dB/mm at 819 nm and 5.1 dB/mm at 1048 nm, respectively. Therefore, this work not only demonstrates that metal&#8211;organic complex glasses with ultralong phosphorescence can effectively serve as sensitizer matrices for boosting NIR&#8208;II emission, but also supports the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) glassy microstructures with ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguiding for advanced NIR&#8208;II photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Multi&#8208;Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction to C2+&#160;Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction (ECR) to C2+&#160;products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency&#160;(FE) and current density&#160;remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni&#160;multi&#8208;metal sites could&#160;effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+&#160;products.&#160;In situ&#160;measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated&#160;that&#160;by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalysts, the electronic structure&#160;and the local *CO coverage&#160;on the Cu surface could&#160;be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+&#160;pathway.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction (ECR) to C2+&#160;products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency&#160;(FE) and current density&#160;remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu-Ag-Ni&#160;multi-metal sites could&#160;effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+&#160;products.&#160;In situ&#160;measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated&#160;that&#160;by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu-Ag-Ni catalysts, the electronic structure&#160;and the local *CO coverage&#160;on the Cu surface could&#160;be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+&#160;pathway. In particular, Cu-Ag-Ni catalyst with dispersed multi-sites (CuxAgNi DNPs)&#160;could more effectively reduce&#160;the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling than Cu-Ag-Ni catalyst with&#160;phase-separated multi-sites (CuxAgNi PNPs).

         <title>Plasmonic&#8208;Hydrogel Hybrid Biomaterials Via In Situ Seeded Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed chemical analysis of the interactions between Au3+ ions and gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels enables the development of a robust &#8220;in situ&#8221; seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of plasmonic gold nanoparticles, whereby gold salts are reduced directly on the surface of hydrogel substrates to form the nanostructures. These hybrid plasmonic&#8208;hydrogel materials have potential applications in 3D cell culture, tumor/tissue models, and chemical and biological sensors.








Abstract
The combination of hydrogels and functional plasmonic metal nanoparticles affords the development of unique hybrid systems, such as actuators, biosensors, and drug delivery systems, among others. Being typically prepared in colloidal suspension, incorporating shape&#8208;controlled plasmonic nanoparticles on polymer substrates typically requires lengthy processes involving synthesis, washing, and self&#8208;assembly. We report an alternative, robust in situ seed&#8208;mediated growth method whereby either isotropic or anisotropic gold and silver nanoparticles can be prepared directly on gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels, taking advantage of the polymer's native chemical functionalities. In&#8208;depth characterization of gold precursor&#8211;polymer interactions enabled the rational growth of branched gold nanoparticles on biocompatible hydrogels with different physicochemical properties. In situ seeded growth circumvents traditional limitations imposed by the need for colloidal stability, thereby enabling gold nanoparticle synthesis under surfactant&#8208;free conditions and in high ionic strength solutions, thus enhancing their suitability for applications involving live cells. This method can be expanded to create libraries of hybrid plasmonic materials with potential impact in the fabrication of functional 3D cell culture substrates, as well as biological and chemical sensors.

         <title>Harnessing Molecular Recognition for Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Mediated Reversible Photochemical Control Over mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule ligand undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamer in a selective manner, dependent on both the RNA sequence/structure and ligand chemical structure. A caged mRNA construct incorporating the PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or p53 coding sequence remained translationally repressed until exposure to 302&#160;nm light, which cleaved the photocage and restored translation in vitro and in cells, enabling precise photochemical control of both wild type and reporter gene expression.








Abstract
Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302&#160;nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.

         <title>Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Copper(I) Alkynyl Nanoclusters with Exposed Polyoxomolybdate Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directed synthesis of copper(I) nanoclusters with atomically precise active sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses notable challenges. By carefully regulating the acidity of the reaction system, a set of five atomically precise Mo&#8208;Cu heterometallic nanoclusters were effectively synthesized. The adjustment of the reaction system&#8217;s acidity stimulates the polymerization of molybdate, consequently influencing the encapsulation structure of the outer copper(I) shell and thereby controlling the number of catalytically active sites located at the periphery of these nanoclusters. When subjected to xenon lamp irradiation, the synthesized Mo&#8208;Cu nanoclusters, which showcase exposed polyoxomolybdates, exhibit significantly activity in the conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 160.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) while maintaining an impressive selectivity of up to 99.9% without any additional sacrificial agent, cocatalyst or photosensitizer. When sacrificial agent and photosensitizer were added to the CO2RR system, the maximum CO production rates for Mo16Cu36&#8208;1 and Mo22Cu30 were 5672.1 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 7370.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, with CO selectivities of 90.3% and 90.6%. The Mo&#8722;O&#8722;Cu active sites play a dual role in enhancing both CO2 adsorption and activation, as well as facilitating charge separation. This study elucidates the synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity Mo&#8208;Cu nanoclusters with potent photocatalytic activity in CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Control over Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Elucidating Electron Transfer Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have emerged as promising functional materials due to their programmable architectures and tunable functionalities. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of porphyrin&#8208;based 2D COFs remains restricted by the prevalent use of sql topology, hindering comprehensive structure&#8208;property exploration. Herein, we systematically designed and synthesized porphyrinic 2D COFs featuring distinct sql and bex topological configurations. Comprehensive structural characterization confirmed precise control over lattice geometries, revealing monoporous structure in sql topology versus biporous architecture in bex topology. Electrochemical investigations uncovered topologygoverned electron transport characteristics, with the unique coordination geometry of bex topology exhibiting enhanced electron transfer efficiency. Band structure analysis demonstrated that topological configuration and chemical composition collectively modulate electronic structures. Inspired by these findings, we developed nickel&#8208;incorporated bex&#8208;COFs for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. The optimized Ni&#8208;BBFPP&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF with bex topology demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, achieving a low overpotential of 342 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, which surpasses most reported porphyrin&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This study not only significantly expands the structural repertoire of porphyrinic COFs, but also establishes explicit correlations between topological engineering and electrocatalytic performance, providing fundamental design principles for advanced energy conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructions of Biaryl&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles through Phosphine&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Controlled Switch of Selectivity between Intra&#8208; and Inter&#8208;Molecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rigid biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles serve as core scaffolds in numerous bioactive molecules. However, constructing biaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles smaller than 14&#8208;membered ring remains challenging, partially due to the strain present in the cyclic intermediates formed during their synthesis. Here, we report that a Pd catalyst supported by P(tBu)3 effectively promotes the intramolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation of phenols with aryl bromides, leading to the efficient synthesis of both strained 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl&#8208;bridged macrocycles and strain&#8208;free bimolecular counterparts. The success of this Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization in generating strained macrocycles originates from the dissociation of the P(tBu)3 ligand from the Pd center, which facilitates dual chelation of functional groups of substrates to the Pd center of palladacycle intermediate for alleviating its strain. Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2&#8208;hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemo&#8208;selectivity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations.</dc:description>

Additionally, Pd catalysts supported by PPh3 promote intermolecular cyclization of the same substrates, enabling formation of larger macrocycles bridged by two 2-hydroxybiaryl motifs. These two distinct cyclization modes illustrate how phosphine ligands control the switch of chemo-selectivity in Pd-catalyzed cyclizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Divergent Reaction of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with Quinones for the Synthesis of Diverse Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) are highly strained hydrocarbons with unique structural properties and intrinsic reactivity, making them valuable building blocks for constructing complex molecular architectures. Herein, we report the Lewis acid catalyzed divergent reactions of BCBs with quinones, yielding a diverse array of polycyclic molecules. Using Sc(OTf)&#8323; as a catalyst, pyrazole&#8208;substituted BCBs efficiently undergo formal (3+2) cycloaddition reactions with quinones, producing highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes featuring a caged framework. Monosubstituted BCB ketones undergo a sequential cascade involving Alder&#8208;ene reaction, 4&#960; electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening, and [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, yielding fused benzoxepines efficiently. Disubstituted BCB esters, ketones, and amides undergo a tandem isomerization and (3+2) cycloaddition process, stereoselectively yielding tetrahydrocyclobuta[b]benzofuran products. Notably, strong Lewis acids such as SnCl&#8324; and BiBr&#8323; directly participate in the ring&#8208;opening reactions of monosubstituted BCB ketones, generating halogenated cyclobutane derivatives. Additionally, the synthetic potential of these approaches has been further highlighted through scale&#8208;up experiments and a range of transformations. This study demonstrates the tunability of reaction pathways based on the diverse substitution patterns of BCBs, providing efficient methods for the synthesis of a range of polycyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Helical Columnar Liquid Crystal Exhibiting Both Polarization Retention and Ferroelectric Switching at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric columnar liquid crystals (FCLCs) with switchable bistable axial polarizations are promising candidates for high&#8208;density ferroelectric random&#8208;access memory (FeRAM). However, FCLCs simultaneously exhibiting uniform polarization arrangement and ferroelectric switching at room temperature (RT) remain elusive. Herein, we report an RT&#8208;operable FCLC based on a C3&#8208;symmetric star&#8208;shaped mesogen with polar linkers. Two CLCs, 1 and 2, were synthesized incorporating 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and amide linkers, respectively. 1 undergoes a ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition accompanied by a structural change from a helical to a non&#8208;helical columnar phase. Notably, the ferroelectric switching is operable down to RT, with complete retention of its axial macrodipole after removal of the electric field. In contrast, 2 forms only a non&#8208;helical columnar LC phase, displaying paraelectric behavior. The contrasting self&#8208;assembly and dielectric properties are attributed to the differences in the polar unit size. This study demonstrates that the mesogen extension with a bulky 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker enables the realization of a FCLC operable at RT, offering significant potential for high&#8208;density FeRAM applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of three rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids, (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol A (1), (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol B (2) and (&#8211;)&#8208;Sanguinolane (3), using a 13, 17 and 14 step longest&#8208;linear sequences respectively, featuring a novel intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition to construct the unique pentacyclic framework containing an unprecedented tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonane motif. Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical; a Robinson&#8208;type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Synergistic Dual Activation Enables Efficient Transesterification by Multi&#8208;nuclear Titanium Catalyst: Recycling and Upcycling of Polyester Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and selective catalysts for chemical recycling and upcycling of plastic waste is essential for establishing a sustainable plastics economy and reducing environmental impact. Here, we report a novel tetranuclear titanium catalyst that enables highly efficient transesterification reaction of esters and polyesters. Detailed experimental and computational studies have revealed that a bi&#8208;titanium framework facilitates a dual activation mechanism, activating both alcohol and ester simultaneously, thereby significantly enhancing the transesterification process. This catalyst demonstrated exceptionally high activity in the methanolysis of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with an activity up to 1.9 &#215;107 gPET molTi&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 0.005 mol % catalyst loading, producing polymerizable dimethyl ester and glycol monomers. Additionally, it effectively catalyzed the re&#8208;polymerization of the recovered monomers, yielding the original polyester with high molecular weight and thereby achieving an ideal circular economy for commodity polyesters. Furthermore, this catalyst can also be utilized for the efficient upgrading of PET waste via transesterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol, polybutylene adipate, and poly(tetramethyene ether glycol), yielding engineering plastic, biodegradable polyester, and thermoplastic elastomer, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8722;MTAPP MCOFs (M = 2H, Co, Cu and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8722;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8208;0.8 V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58 eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO &#8594; *HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.</dc:description>

         <title>Erasable Fluorescence Imaging Technology Enables Continuous Tracking for Identical Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new erasable labeling method, utilizing melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly, realizes fluorescence labeling at 25&#160;&#176;C and fluorescence erasing at 37&#160;&#176;C for the specific marker on the identical living cell at any time. Due to its simple conditions satisfying the most fundamental experimental scenarios, this method has high potential as a powerful preliminary screening tool for new biological mechanisms through continuously tracking the life activities of cells.








Abstract
Subtle molecular events may trigger a cascade of &#8220;butterfly effects&#8221; to reverse cell fate, so dynamic tracking of relevant markers can provide crucial clues to decipher the unknown. However, existing analytical techniques are still at static&#8208;analysis level, and cutting&#8208;edge fluorescence imaging is limited by signal interference at adjacent time, failing to realize continuous observation for identical live cells. Herein, we develop a new temperature&#8208;controlled imaging technology, where melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly drives the fluorescence illuminating and extinguishing at any time, achieving repeated erasable imaging for identical living cells. This method can track cell behaviors by taking dynamic monitoring of cell differentiation as an example, and timely fluorescence erasing guarantees authenticity for imaging results and minimizes interference with cellular activities. Thanks to high feasibility in fundamental experimental scenarios, this method hopefully provides a powerful preliminary screening tool for exploring new biological mechanisms in cell interactions, developmental transformations, downstream response inquiry, and so forth.

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

         <title>Prebiotic Interconversion of Pyruvate and Lactate over Zeolite&#8208;Supported Ni Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni mineral can catalyze the interconversion of metabolically crucial pyruvate and lactate under hydrothermal vent conditions, which could pave the way for the modern biological process by lactate dehydrogenase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.








Abstract
Submarine hydrothermal vents harbor diverse microbial communities and have long intrigued researchers studying the origin of life. Transition metals in these environments can be reduced by serpentinization, potentially forming zeolite&#8208;supported transition metal nanoparticles capable of driving prebiotic chemistry. This inorganic structure could catalyze biochemical reactions, including converting metabolically crucial pyruvate before the emergence of biological processes. This study explores the catalytic interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, mediated by lactate dehydrogenase in biochemical systems, using inorganic zeolite Y&#8208;supported Ni nanoparticles (Ni/Y) under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Our results demonstrate that Ni/Y effectively catalyzes the hydrogenation of pyruvate in an inert environment, facilitated by the in situ generation of H&#8322; through an autocatalytic reaction between Ni/Y and H&#8322;O. Post&#8208;reaction analysis by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed structural transformations in the catalyst, including the formation of unique nickel oxide and hydroxide species, along with extra&#8208;framework aluminum from zeolite dealumination, resulting in a thin amorphous nickel oxide/hydroxide layer. Notably, Ni/Y also enables the oxidative reconversion of lactate to pyruvate under atmospheric conditions&#8212;an essential reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in biological systems. These findings underscore the potential prebiotic role of Ni/Y, suggesting they may have catalyzed the synthesis of key metabolic intermediates.

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;Area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose for the first time the concept of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid oriented PN heterostructured films to modulate the photocatalytic performance by constructing COF&#8208;based PN heterostructured films, and our mechanistic studies confirm that oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COFs based on thin films of PN heterostructures can provide the driving force to enhance the separation efficiency and transport kinetics of photogenerated carriers, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potential in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, they suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COF&#8208;based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2 induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Experimental results reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2 (TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 8154 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is &#8764;2.5 times and &#8764;4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2 performance. The new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2 will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

         <title>Rapid Access to Conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;Trienes</title>

Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene: A novel method to facilitate rapid access to the otherwise inaccessible conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif is reported.








Abstract
Intercepting reactions have recently emerged as an innovative approach in organic synthesis, allowing chemists to harness reactive intermediates to access structures and functionalities that conventional methods cannot easily achieve. By deliberately manipulating reaction pathways, this strategy provides a unique avenue to explore unusual reactivities and complex molecular architectures. In this work, we have developed a new protocol for the nucleophile&#8208;intercepted Beckmann fragmentation reaction (NuBFr). Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8211; a simple and readily accessible precursor&#160;&#8211;&#160;and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated Z,Z,Z&#8208;triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting Z,Z,Z&#8208;trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.

Employing tropone oxime tosylate &#8211; a simple and readily accessible precursor&#160;&#8211;&#160;and a diverse set of nucleophiles generated in situ from alcohols, phenols, thiols and alkynes with strong bases, we successfully synthesized a library of novel conjugated &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-trienecarbonitrile derivatives. This method facilitates rapid access to the conjugated &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-triene motif, a structural feature rarely encountered in synthetic chemistry. Our computational studies indicate that the NuBFr reaction likely proceeds through the formation of a bicylic azirine intermediate. The resulting &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-trienecarbonitriles could undergo an unprecedented thermally induced 8&#960;/6&#960;/4&#960; electrocyclization cascade sequence to produce trisubstituted olefins. This sequence underscores the fundamental value of these motifs in pushing the boundaries of unusual reactivities in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immunoengineering of a Photocaged 5&#180;&#8208;triphosphate Oligoribonucleotide Ligand for Spatiotemporal Control of RIG&#8208;I Activation in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for precise control of RIG&#8208;I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), an innate immune receptor of RNA that, when activated, induces anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and cancer cell death. By incorporating photocage modifications into RNA ligands, we enable a spatially and temporally regulated immune response and offer a targeted strategy for cancer therapy while minimizing systemic effects.








Abstract
Photochemical control of oligonucleotides bears great potential for the spatio&#8208;temporal control of therapeutic targets, such as immune sensing receptors. Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) is a cytoplasmic receptor of the innate immune system that triggers antiviral responses upon detection of viral RNA. RIG&#8208;I can be specifically activated by short double&#8208;stranded (ds) RNA with a blunt 5&#8242; end bearing a triphosphate, mimicking nascent viral transcripts. Tumor cells are specifically sensitive to RIG&#8208;I&#8208;induced cell death. Here we developed a potent oligonucleotide ligand for spatiotemporally controlled activation of RIG&#8208;I by light exposure. Through structural considerations and functional studies we identified a combination of two nucleoside positions in a RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand for which the substitution of both respective 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of the ribose by photolabile protecting groups (2&#8242;&#8208;photocages) resulted in a complete loss of RIG&#8208;I ligand activity, whereas photocaging the individual positions was not sufficient to turn off RIG&#8208;I. Light exposure fully restored RIG&#8208;I activation by the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand, enabling light&#8208;controlled RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated cell death of human cancer cells which had internalized the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand prior to light exposure. This novel photoactivatable RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand may be applicable for precise light&#8208;controlled induction of tumor cell death in superficial cancer such as melanoma.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A General and Efficient Method for the Direct Synthesis of Primary Arylamines Through Electrochemical Amination of Aryl Halides With NH3 Has Been Developed. The Weak Nucleophilic Reagent NH3 Acted as an Ammonia Surrogate. This Approach Shows Good Functional Group Tolerance and a Broad Scope of Functionalized Primary Arylamines That Can be Further Late&#8208;stage Modification of Drug Molecules and Gram&#8208;scale Reaction Demonstrate Its Synthetic Utility.








Abstract
Primary arylamines are the most pivotal class of organic motifs in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, ligands and natural products. Ammonia (NH3) is an ideal nitrogen source in terms of reactivity, atom economy, and environmental compatibility. Despite significant progress in the synthesis of primary arylamines, the development of a general method for rapid access to diversely functionalized primary arylamines is still urgent and necessary. Herein, we developed a method for the direct synthesis of primary arylamines through electrochemical amination of aryl halides with NH3. Notably, the weak nucleophilic reagent NH3 was directly used as an ammonia surrogate, allowing for efficient conversion of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds to diverse primary arylamines with good functional group tolerance. A broad scope of functionalized primary arylamines has been achieved in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Low&#8208;Redox&#8208;Barrier Two&#8208;Electron p&#8208;Type Phenoselenazine Cathode for Superior Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron organic chalcogen small molecules as cathode materials were reported, where phenoselenazine liberates high dual&#8208;electron utilization of 99.2% due to high coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow activation energy (0.23&#160;eV). The Zn&#8208;organic battery delivers the highest capacity storage and energy density among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with good cycling stability.








Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials with high redox potentials and fast kinetics have captured widespread attention in propelling Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). However, their anion&#8208;accessible capacity is insufficient due to single electron reaction and/or high energy barrier of each redox&#8208;active unit. Here, we design two&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type organic chalcogen small molecules (phenoxazine (PO), phenothiazine (PS), and phenoselenazine (PSe)) with tuned charge distributions and electron transfer behaviors as cathode materials for ZOBs. With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&#160;&gt;&#160;S&#160;&gt;&#160;Se), PSe liberates the strongest coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow redox activation energy (0.23&#160;vs. 0.34&#160;eV of PS and 0.41&#160;eV of PO), which contributes to high dual&#8208;electron utilization of phenazine motifs of 99.2% (vs. 68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers the highest capacity storage (227&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (273&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with long life (10&#160;000 cycles). A two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is unlocked at amine/selenium sites of PSe, accompanied by reversible uptake of two CF3SO3&#8722; anions. This study highlights the considerable potential of low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier multielectron design for high&#8208;performance organic cathodes toward advanced ZOBs.

         <title>Optical Probes for Cellular Imaging of G&#8208;quadruplexes: Beyond Fluorescence Intensity Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA can fold into tetra&#8208;stranded helical structures known as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). There is mounting evidence suggesting that these structures have important biological roles. In this minireview we discuss advances in the design of optical probes for the detection of G4s that offer intensity&#8208;independent readouts that address limitations of conventional fluorescence intensity&#8208;based probes.








Abstract
The study of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures that form in DNA and RNA is a rapidly growing field, which has evolved from in vitro studies of isolated G4 sequences to genome&#8208;wide detection of G4s in a cellular context. This work has revealed the tangible and significant effects that G4s may have on biological regulation. This minireview describes recent progress in the design of photoluminescent intensity&#8208;independent optical probes for G4s. We discuss the design and use of probes based on fluorescence or phosphorescence lifetime, rather than intensity&#8208;based detection; spectral ratiometric probes; and fluorescent probes for single&#8208;molecule G4&#8208;detection. We argue that each of these modalities improve unbiased G4 detection in cellular experiments, overcoming problems associated with unknown cellular uptake of probes or their organelle concentration. We discuss the improvements offered by these types of probes, as well as limitations and future research directions needed to facilitate more robust research into G4 biology.

         <title>Synergistic Conversion of Hydrogen Peroxide and Benzaldehyde in Air by Silver Single&#8208;Atom Modified Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized g&#8208;C3N4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4) photocatalyst with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. It enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2O2 production and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. Thiophene conjugation and Ag single atoms enhance light absorption and accelerate the 2e&#8722; ORR, boosting H2O2 yield, while photogenerated holes promote benzyl alcohol oxidation. The biphasic system enables spontaneous product separation. DFT calculations reveal Ag&#8208;thiophene interactions optimize the reaction pathway, strengthen catalyst&#8211;intermediate interactions, and reduce Gibbs free energy, thus enhancing efficiency.

Under visible light, Ag@T&#9472;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C&#9472;H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a practical method for synthesizing aromatic allylamines via iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive allylic amination. This approach eliminates the need for noble metals and complements existing oxidative allylic amination by tolerating oxidizable and nucleophilic functionalities.








Abstract
Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso&#8208;ene step.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thianthrene Covalent Trimer Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials for Low&#8208;Concentration Oxygen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emission system of fluorescence (Fluo.) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling was constructed via thianthrene covalent trimerization, enabling high oxygen sensitivity and ratiometric optical oxygen sensing. The significant emission color and intensity change under varying oxygen concentrations allows for real&#8208;time video&#8208;based monitoring of low&#8208;concentration oxygen.








Abstract
Oxygen is ubiquitous and vital to life, industry, and environmental safety, so accurate and reliable oxygen sensing and detection are of great significance, especially for oxygen in the low concentration range. Herein, two pure organic metal&#8208;free room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials were developed using a covalent trimerization strategy of thianthrene (TA), which exhibit high oxygen sensitivity and fluorescence&#8208;RTP separated dual emission due to the moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Compared with traditional metal&#8208;organic complexes, the oxygen sensitivity of RTP is improved by about two orders of magnitude, especially facilitating accurate quantitative detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen. Leveraging oxygen quenching&#8208;induced changes in emission color and intensity, coupled with computer&#8208;assisted image processing, a simple oxygen monitoring device was established to realize real&#8208;time and accurate detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen, promoting the industrial practical application in many related fields.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose Toward Propyl&#8208; or Propenyl&#8208;Substituted Monomers and Mechanistic Understanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol solvolyzed lignin followed by simultaneous cleavage of C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bond enables valorization of native lignin in biomass toward prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl (79.6% selectivity) and propyl (81.7% selectivity) substituted monomers under N2 and H2 atmosphere, respectively.








Abstract
Reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) is a promising technology that can selectively extract lignin in biomass and depolymerize it. Here, we prepared one low Ru loading catalyst (Ru0.8/C) for RCF of biomass to selectively produce different lignin oils (both monomers and oligomers) under different reaction atmospheres. The yield of phenolic monomers reached 46.0wt.% (rich in 4&#8208;propylguaiacol and 4&#8208;propylsyringol) in the RCF of birch wood under high H2 pressure and using methanol as the solvent. But, under N2 atmosphere the dominant monomers shifted to 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)guaiacol and 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl)syringol (79.6% selectivity) with 35.8wt.% yield of total monomers using the same catalyst. The developed catalyst can also transform native lignin in other biomasses such as pine and corn stover. Mechanistic investigation using different model compounds and deuteration indicates that removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH in methanol&#8208;extracted lignin fragments occurred before obtaining the monomeric lignin fragment, and the C&#945;&#9472;OH and &#946;&#9472;O&#9472;4 bonds were then cleaved simultaneously to form 4&#8208;(prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl) substituted monomers. The results are distinct from the reported mechanism that the precursors of the propyl and prop&#8208;1&#8208;enyl substituted monomers are monolignols with removal of the C&#947;&#9472;OH at the monomeric level. Thus, this work provided novel insights into the reaction pathway of (native) lignin depolymerization.

         <title>Extending Frontier Molecular Orbitals Delocalization via Donor Fusion: Construct Long&#8208;Wavelength Twisted Multiple Resonance Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general donor fusion strategy is proposed to extend frontier molecular orbital delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed. BN&#8208;PhAzCz achieves the best device performances, exhibiting green emission at 528&#160;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69), maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2%, and efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Here, we propose a general strategy for post&#8208;functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via Scholl cyclization, which can extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red&#8208;shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[6]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spinorbit coupling, ultimately enabling molecule BN&#8208;PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1). BN&#8208;PhAzCz&#8208;based single&#8208;host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.

BN-PhAzCz achieves the best device performances, exhibiting green emission at 528&#160;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69), maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2%, and efficiency roll-off of 28.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra-high-definition organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Here, we propose a general strategy for post-functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via Scholl cyclization, which can extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long-wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof-of-concept molecules, BN-PhAzCz and BN-tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red-shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[6]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spinorbit coupling, ultimately enabling molecule BN-PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). BN-PhAzCz-based single-host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll-off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via Anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;Type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition is reported. Various (hetero)arene nucleophiles and carbon electrophiles were incorporated in a manner opposite to conventional regioselectivity. A key feature of this reaction is the formation of an alkylpalladium intermediate, which enables the achievement of the uncommon regioselectivity.








Abstract
Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Sourced 4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dithiolanes for Recyclable Poly(disulfide)s with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis was developed to access aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers. The resulting aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability and stability, as well as a range of desirable thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, showing potential toward sustainable materials.








Abstract
The development of recyclable polymers presents a solution to the urgent issues of circular plastics economy. To this end, there is an increasing interest in expanding the utility of poly(disulfide)s, which contains dynamic covalent S&#9472;S bonds to enable intrinsic degradability. Lipoic acid and its derivatives represent the most widely used class of monomers for the preparation of poly(disulfide)s. However, their physical properties are usually on the soft side of thermoplastics and can face challenges in wider applications. In this contribution, we report a scalable synthesis of a new class of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;dithiolane monomers from bio&#8208;sourced phenol ethers and their ring&#8208;opening polymerization to aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s. The aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s display high recyclability without the cost of stability. The introduction of aryl side chains systematically improves the thermal properties of poly(disulfide)s. The optical properties of aryl&#8208;substituted poly(disulfide)s are competitive and so are the mechanical properties of the crosslinked network, showing potential for applications in sustainable materials.

         <title>Design and Construction of D&#8208;A&#8208;Extended 3D Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully developed three distinct 3D extended D&#8208;A COFs with a pyr topology by employing a newly designed intrinsic D&#8208;A type building block. Among these, the A&#8208;D&#8208;A structured COF stands out due to its multiple charge transfer channels in 3D space, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. This finding provides valuable insights into designing extended D&#8208;A constructs within 3D frameworks to optimize photocatalytic performance. 








Abstract
The development of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Although most studies have concentrated on 2D COFs, research into their 3D counterparts remains limited. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a carbazoyl dicyanobenzene derivative (TBFCC) as an intrinsic D&#8208;A building block. By selecting TAPA, TAPB, and TAPT as the donor, acceptor&#8208;&#960;, and acceptor donors, respectively, we synthesized three distinct D&#8208;A&#8208;extended COF materials: D&#8208;D&#8208;A, A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;A, and A&#8208;D&#8208;A. Among these, 3D&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF, featuring an A&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 31.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported 3D COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This superior performance is attributed to its A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration, which provides multiple charge transfer pathways in 3D space, overcoming the electron transport limitations inherent in 2D COFs. Consequently, this feature facilitates efficient separation of photogenerated charges within the framework and reduces carrier recombination, thereby optimizing photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Enantioselective Photochemical Generation of a Short&#8208;Lived, Twisted Cycloheptenone Isomer: Catalytic Formation, Detection, and Consecutive Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, it was for the first time shown that planar chiral trans&#8208;cycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;enones, such as 2, can be formed enantioselectively from their cis&#8208;isomers by triplet energy transfer from a chiral catalyst. Computational studies performed with cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone and enone 1 provided invaluable insights into the mode of action of the sensitizing thioxanthone catalyst.








Abstract
Cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization from its cis&#8208; to its trans&#8208;form either upon direct irradiation (&#955;&#160;=&#160;366&#160;nm) or in the presence of a triplet sensitizer (&#955;&#160;=&#160;459&#160;nm). The intermediate chiral trans&#8208;isomer was detected by step&#8208;scan FTIR, displaying a lifetime of 130&#160;&#181;s (r.t., CH2Cl2). Ensuing Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of the trans&#8208;isomer occurred smoothly and produced chiral trans&#8208;fused cycloaddition products (14 examples, 24%&#8211;98% yield). Benzylation led to esters, which were separated by chiral HPLC and which were employed to evaluate a possible enantioselective reaction course. It was discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid with a pendant sensitizing group induces a notable enantioselectivity in the photoisomerization step. The planar chirality of the trans&#8208;cycloheptene translates into point chirality in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (seven examples, up to 38% ee). Computational studies suggest that the chiral conformation of the cis&#8208;isomer adopted within the assembly to the chiral phosphoric acid induces the enantioselectivity in a one&#8208;bond flip (OBF) toward the trans&#8208;isomer. Trajectory surface hopping (TSH) simulations showed exemplarily how a chiral trans&#8208;cyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;enone is formed from a chiral cis&#8208;conformer. For the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a weak ground state selectivity was found to attenuate the enantioselectivity achieved in the photochemical step.

         <title>Ternary Metalation in a Copper&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Tandem Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem photocatalytic heterometallic COF system combining photosensitive Ru sites, CO&#8208;producing Co sites, and multi&#8208;electron&#8208;reducing trinuclear Cu sites has been constructed by a sequential post&#8208;synthetic metallization strategy. The synergistic effect of the multiple Ru, Co, and Cu sites leads to a highly efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with efficient synergistic effects for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction is sought&#8208;after yet challenging. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic strategy has been developed through sequential post&#8208;synthetic metalation (SPSM) of variable Ru/Co&#8208;sites into a trinuclear Cu&#8208;based COF, Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, to construct a series of tri&#8208;metallized covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the Ru:Co molar ratios of 1/39.6, 1/19.6, or 1/12.7, respectively), for photocatalytic CO2 methanation in high selectivity. The introduction of a small fraction of Ru&#8208;sites confers the framework with enhanced visible&#8208;light response, while the Co&#8208;sites immobilized in the bipyridine units significantly boost the generation of CO to enrich its concentration around the active trinuclear Cu&#8208;sites, which enables dramatically improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity toward CH4. Significantly, the optimized Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;2 showcases exceptional photocatalytic activity with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%, 15.0 times higher than that of Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru) merely introducing Ru&#8208;photosensitizer. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism has been studied to unveil how the ternary Ru/Co/Cu&#8208;sites collaborate to result in highly efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, shedding light on the design of highly selective CO2 methanation photocatalysts by leveraging the synergistic effect of multiple active centers within heterometallic covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (HM&#8208;COFs).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#9472;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal&#8208;CdS&#8208;based photocatalytic methanol activation was employed for triggering C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The hole&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated cleavage of methanol C&#9472;H bond and electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated reduction of hydroxymethylated intermediate were identified. Such transformations not only facilitate the cascade utilization of photogenerated holes and electrons, but also enable selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated products.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#9472;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Enables Access to High&#8208;Performance Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Polyamides with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address these key challenges faced in PA6 chemistry, we aimed to prepare a new class of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams bearing various substituents (BLMR) as monomers. The robust polymerization of these monomers furnished a series of semiaromatic polyamides P(BLMR) with improved water resistance, transparency, and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLMR). These BLMR monomers underwent robust and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization to afford P(BLMR) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLMR) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100&#8722;150 &#176;C with a mixed catalyst of t&#8208;BuOK and La[N(SiMe3)2]3, thus establishing a closed&#8208;loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semiaromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high&#8208;performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Retained Oxygen Regulation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper for Promoted CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thickness determined strategy has been demonstrated to regulate oxygen retention in oxide&#8208;derived Cu for CO2 electroreduction. With the thickness decreasing to 1.6&#160;nm, the CuO nanosheets exhibit enhanced oxygen retention and reoxidation ability, achieving up to 84.6% C2+ faradaic efficiency at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the retained oxygen facilitates *CHO intermediate formation and promotes *OC&#9472;CHO coupling, thereby enhancing C2+ selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products provides an attractive route to store intermittent renewable electricity as high value&#8208;added chemicals. Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) has been widely investigated for its tunable selectivity toward multicarbon (C2+) products; however, it still remains a challenge to understand and regulate the retained oxygen of OD&#8208;Cu in the complex reconstruction process. In this work, we investigate thickness determined residual oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, using CuO nanosheets as prototype precatalysts. When the thickness of CuO precatalyst decreased to 1.6&#160;nm, the enhancement of the ability to retain oxygen are achieved, leading to selective C2+ production with Faradaic efficiency of around 80% over a wide current density range of 300&#8211;700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a peak value of 84.6% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Long&#8208;time molecular dynamics simulations reveal the enhanced stability of Cu&#8211;CuO structure with the layers of removed oxygen increased, favoring *CHO formation and *OC&#8208;CHO coupling toward C2+ products; structural characterizations and electrochemical results further demonstrate the reconstructed stacked nanosheets with high oxygen retention capacity and easily reoxidized metallic Cu sites. This work underscores the crucial role of the retained oxygen for the OD&#8208;Cu performance and provides insights into designing OD&#8208;Cu with oxygen retention to enhance C2+ products formation.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Molecular Configuration to Drive Facet&#8208;Selective Zn Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental study elucidating the influence of dicarboxylic acids with varying alkyl chain lengths on their adsorption configuration, strength, and deposition rate on Zn surfaces, which ultimately enables control over highly facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition at metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface.








Abstract
The direct use of metal anode emerges as a key strategy in advancing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, applicable across non&#8208;protonic, aqueous, and solid&#8208;state battery systems. To enhance battery durability, one effective approach involves employing interfacial molecular modification to modulate metal's facet orientation, reducing the tendency of metals to form random and loose morphologies during deposition. Herein, we propose a model to elucidate how dicarboxylic acid molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths modulate their adsorption behavior and deposition rate on zinc (Zn) surfaces, achieving facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition. Taking glutaric acid (GA) as an example, its medium alkyl chain length allows for a &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption configuration on Zn(002) surface, resulting in strong adsorption and Zn&#8208;GA metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface. This regulates Zn2+ diffusion process and restricts its accessibility to Zn(002) facet, facilitating the selective exposure of Zn(002) facet. Due to this design, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell stably operates at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge of 85%. The Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 1.1&#160;Ah with 90% capacity retention. This metal&#8208;molecule interface design can be extended to other metal anodes, with the potential for tailored molecular selections to regulate the selective growth of crystal facets.

         <title>The Role of Convex Edge Site in Fully&#8208;Exposed Pt Cluster Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters on CeO2 outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites and hollow sites) in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction due to their excellent C&#9472;H bond activation capability and prohibition of undesired C&#9472;C bond cleavage&#8208;induced site reactions or benzene poisoning. 








Abstract
Achieving a precise understanding of the active site structure has long been an ultimate goal in fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research, yet it remains exceptionally challenging in nanocluster catalysis. In Pt&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane dehydrogenation for liquid organic carriers (LOHC), previous efforts have provided valuable insights into the size effects of nanoclusters. However, the optimal geometry of the active sites has remained elusive and, at times, contradictory. In this study, we investigate the geometric effect and the active site structure in fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters supported on ceria that exhibit superior activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation (11.4&#160;mol molPt&#8722;&#185; s&#8722;&#185;), characterized by small coordination numbers, high metal utilization efficiency, and abundant convex edge sites. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites, hollow sites, etc.) in dehydrogenation reactions. These convex edge sites are not only efficient in C&#9472;H activation but, more notably, are also resistant to detrimental carbonaceous intermediates, hence enabling high and long&#8208;lived H2 production activity.

         <title>Application of Molecular Ferroelectric in Photocatalytic Selective Oxidization of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) achieves a remarkable 104&#8208;fold enhancement in alkane oxidation activity compared to BaTiO3, with a turnover number (TON) of 6286 under light and ultrasound. Its built&#8208;in electric field enables efficient charge separation, while synergistic effects drive reactive oxygen species generation, highlighting its promising application in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics utilize metal nodes and organic groups as catalytic active sites, with the surrounding ferroelectric polarization significantly enhancing catalytic activity and showcasing tremendous application potential. However, their application in photocatalysis remains underexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric CuCl4&#8208;[R&#8208;MPA] (MPA = &#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine) as a photocatalyst for alkane oxidation. Under the combined effects of light and ultrasound, this catalyst exhibited a notable turnover number (TON) of 6286&#160;&#177;&#160;491, which is 104 times higher than that of inorganic ferroelectrics like barium titanate (BaTiO3). The molecular ferroelectric exhibits excellent recyclability, good functional group tolerance, and broad substrate applicability. Mechanistic studies indicate that the built&#8208;in electric field within the molecular ferroelectric facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers, thereby enhancing its ferroelectric photocatalytic activity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results further reveal that the synergistic effects of light and ultrasound effectively generate reactive oxygen species. These findings underscore the unique advantages of molecular ferroelectrics compared to rigid inorganic counterparts, including their distinctive structural features and finely tunable catalytic performance, highlighting their potential for developing homogeneous, precisely active sites and efficient photocatalysts. This research lays the foundation for the broader application of molecular ferroelectrics in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Photoactivatable Plasma Membrane Probe Based on a Self&#8208;Triggered Photooxidation Cascade for Live Cell Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco&#8208;rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio&#8208;temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self&#8208;triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane&#8208;targeted leuco&#8208;rhodamine (LRhod&#8208;PM), a non&#8208;fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod&#8208;PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod&#8208;PM thereby switching it to its ON state.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we establish a new photoswitching concept called self-triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC). Rhodamine dyes have mild photosensitizing properties that enable subsequent photoactivation and photobleaching of a leuco-rhodamine plasma membrane probe. Upon laser irradiation in the visible range, we successfully performed live SMLM (Single-molecule localization microscopy), allowing to image the plasma membrane at the nanoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super-resolution imaging based on the localization of single emitters requires a spatio-temporal control of the ON and OFF states. To this end, photoactivatable fluorophores are adapted as they can be turned on upon light irradiation. Here, we present a concept called self-triggered photooxidation cascade (STPC) based on the photooxidation of a plasma membrane-targeted leuco-rhodamine (LRhod-PM), a non-fluorescent reduced form of a rhodamine probe. Upon visible light irradiation the small number of oxidized rhodamines, Rhod-PM, acts as a photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen capable of oxidizing the OFF state LRhod-PM thereby switching it to its ON state. We showed that this phenomenon is kinetically favored by a high local concentration and propagates quickly when the probe is embedded in membrane bilayers. In addition, we showed that the close proximity of the dyes favors the photobleaching. At the single-molecule level, the concomitant activation/bleaching phenomena allow reaching a single-molecule blinking regime enabling single-molecule localization microscopy for super-resolution of live cellular membranes and their thin processes including filopodia and tuneling nanotubes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origin of Lithium Dendrite Formation in Sulfide&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionization levels (ILs) of typical Li3PS4 (LPS) configurations served as effective descriptors to evaluate the preference of Li0 deposition within LPS&#8208;based electrolytes. Both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, comprising crystalline LPS (c&#8208;LPS), amorphous LPS (a&#8208;LPS), and fully lithiated LPS (LixLPS), were predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), were identified as critical contributors to the Li dendrite initiation and propagation over the course of battery cycling, ultimately driving dendrite growth.








Abstract
The Li dendrite growth during battery cycles is a well&#8208;known obstacle to the practical application of sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes (SEs), notably Li3PS4 (LPS), in lithium metal batteries. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the mechanism for Li dendrite penetration through SEs exhibiting high shear modulus. Herein, we investigate the optimum deposition sites for Li0 atoms within typical LPS configurations, encompassing crystalline, lithiated, and degraded structures, with their ionization levels employed as descriptors to determine the preferential state (Li0/Li+) of the interstitial Li. Our results suggest that both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including cracks&#160;and grain boundaries (GBs), exhibit a marked propensity to promote the electrochemical deposition of Li0 atoms. Once Li dendrites initiate, the electronic conductivities of those defects undergo a significant surge, catalyzing electron transport and facilitating Li dendrite penetration through the SEs, ultimately driving dendrite growth. Furthermore, we underscore the synergistic interaction between Li dendrite propagation and crack formation within SEs, offering deeper insights into the electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation mechanism in SEs. These findings present novel methodologies for predicting Li dendrite growth and open up alternative perspectives in SE engineering.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4&#8208;Triazole)2(H2PO4)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural dynamics and the chemical bonding origin of a volumetric near&#8208;zero thermal expansion in a coordination polymer across 25&#160;K to 400&#160;K is studied using multi&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography and X&#8208;ray electron density analysis. The lattice expansion in the a and c directions is counteracted by contraction along b axis, caused by concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom librations of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25&#160;K&#8211;400&#160;K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c&#8764;22&#160;MK&#8722;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b&#8764;&#8722;47&#160;MK&#8722;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modeling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (&#8764;8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.

         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;free electrocatalyst based on embedding Co sites into silicate&#8208;1 zeolite exhibits exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of silicate&#8208;1 zeolite isolates Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. Such a moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption while it holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the whole barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieves a high yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that is susceptible to being oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica&#8208;based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8722; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H2O2 production via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The Ni and S dual sites with optimized O2 adsorption and efficient *Hads supply contributes to a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water.








Abstract
Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv) as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8722; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) represents a promising approach for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni-doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni-ZnS-Sv) as a dual-site 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron-rich state enable a Pauling-type (end-on) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#9472;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) materials based on chiral anion strategy were synthesized with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) in amorphous states. The trade&#8208;off problem between good processability and high asymmetry factor was solved by constructing CLIP molecules and utilizing polymer entanglement or rapid solvent evaporation to form amorphous structures.








Abstract
Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed with luminescent properties, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophores and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8722;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC). Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.

         <dc:description>
This study introduces the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial AI&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.








Abstract
Inflammation plays a crucial role in progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); thus, the discovery of rapid and precise analytical tools to assess inflammation related to CVDs is highly desirable for their diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. However, a straightforward and systematic method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in heart organoids has yet to be developed. Herein, we describe the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach has been developed to construct three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, which can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures and exhibit photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. 








Abstract
Compared to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates has, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M&#160;=&#160;Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, which is dependent on their different electronic structures.

They can resist sialidase cleavage, be selective substrates by influenza sialidases, or be nanomolar substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors and affinity ligands selectively for influenza sialidases. Beads immobilized with 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;sialosides have been demonstrated for purifying influenza virions.








Abstract
Seasonal influenza continues to threaten human lives and pose a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy, emphasizing the need for developing better influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and antiviral therapeutics. To address these challenges, we generated a library of structurally diverse sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy. Sialosides containing 4&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted sialic acid were selectively cleaved by sialidases from influenza viruses, whereas sialosides containing 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid were resistant to sialidase cleavage. Interestingly, sialosides containing 4&#8208;amino&#8208; or 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid were effective inhibitors moderately or highly resistant to cleavage by influenza sialidases (also called neuraminidases). The sialosides containing the 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid represent a new class of sialidase substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors. We took advantage of this unique property to create a ligand&#8208;based approach for efficiently isolating influenza virions from egg allantoic fluid with high purity. Together, these compounds are versatile probes and ligands for developing new approaches to detect, profile, isolate, and characterize influenza viruses via neuraminidases on their surface.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Regulation of Catalytic DNA Circuits Using Phosphorylated Charge Reversal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) was developed for efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery or release of catalytic DNA circuitry probes via phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure, thus enabling the precisely space&#8208;controllable in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging.








Abstract
Catalytic DNA circuits have emerged as a powerful tool for high&#8208;performance biosensing application; however, the establishment of a safe and efficient in vivo delivery system remains a critical bottleneck. Peptides serve as attractive carriers due to their rich chemical diversity, excellent biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and specific binding ability, making them ideal candidates for the on&#8208;demand regulation of DNA circuits&#8212;yet remains largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) for the efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery and release of catalytic circuitry probes through a phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure. This ERP&#8208;programmed catalytic DNA circuit enables the precise, spatially controllable in vivo imaging of microRNA (miRNA). The multifunctional cationic peptide formed a stable nanocomplex with anionic DNA cargo via strong electrostatic interactions, thus protecting the DNA probes from degradation in biological environments. Moreover, with the ability to actively targeting tumor cells and facilitate endogenous phosphorylation&#8208;guided release of DNA probes, this multifunctional peptide could significantly reduce the nonspecific delivery of probes to healthy tissues, thereby minimizing unwanted off&#8208;site signal leakage. By the integration of cell&#8208;selective delivery and site&#8208;specific stimulation, this endogenously regulated and multiply guaranteed DNA circuit system paves a simple yet effective way for disease diagnosis.

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 activation on ZnO suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption, which impedes CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast, monodispersed ZnOx confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism, enabling H2 homolytic activation and CO2 hydrogenation at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#9472;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303&#160;K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2&#8722;8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623&#8722;773&#160;K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723&#160;K over 150&#160;h. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.
