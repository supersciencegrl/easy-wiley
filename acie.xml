         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57 kW/kg over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14 kW/kg with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbon belts have drawn great attention because of their unique structures and tantalizing properties. Although a few belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have been synthesized, belt molecules containing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain rare. Herein we report the construction and application of unprecedented zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis features fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions of resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived intermediates, which affords C4&#8208;symmetric tetrabenzobelt[4]arene[4]cyclooctatrienones. Stereoselective ketone reduction with LiAlH4 and nucleophilic addition with alkynyllithiums provide the corresponding tetrahydroxylated belts. The tetraol and its methyl ether are powerful and selective hosts to form 2:1 and 1:1 complexes with cesium ion, respectively, with binding constants up to (1.71&#177;0.33)&#215;1011 M&#8208;2 and (1.50&#177;0.16)&#215;106 M&#8208;1. In addition, enantiopure C4&#8208;symmetric belts can emit CPL with |glum| being around 0.01.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced "D&#8208;f&#8208;A" Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones are featured with a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which is proposed from dearomatization of phenol. However, detailed biochemical characterization of this process is still undiscovered. Herein, we identified oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout study. Through in vivo and in vitro study, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, as a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 expected with ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyses two successive ene&#8208;reductions, which is followed by hydroxylation via OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and TenA&#8208;like P450s mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Synthetic Strategies for 1H&#8208;Indazoles and Their N&#8208;Oxides: Electrochemical Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indazole N&#8208;Oxides and Their Divergent C&#8211;H Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8211;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8211;O bond via paired electrolysis, while Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of our electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8211;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Vacancy Engineering of a Robust ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF for Hexane Isomers Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high&#8208;efficiency separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;based MOF structure, HIAM&#8208;410 (HIAM = Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetracarboxylate (ptc4&#8208;). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, aided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO&#8208;66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post&#8208;synthetic liker insertion. Its separation capability of hexane isomers is enhanced substantially upon the linker vacancy engineering. The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.</dc:description>

The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Chiral Tricyclic Lactams by&#160;Tandem Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination/Lactamization Using Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atom&#8208; and step&#8208; efficient synthesis of chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available keto esters using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source is reported. This Ru&#8208;catalyzed system operates through an efficient tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA)/lactamization, and produces chiral fused tricyclic lactams in high yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee, &gt;20:1 dr and 98% yield). The robust method is also applied to the concise synthesis of key intermediates of the Rivastigmine analogues and chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven CH4 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products and H2 is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar energy&#8208;driven iron ions redox cycle for combining CH4 conversion and H2 production. A photo&#8208;driven iron&#8208;induced reaction system is developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH4 as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH4 conversion, 94% of C2 selectivity and 8.4 &#956;mol h&#8722;1of C2H6 formation rate is achieved. Mechanism studies reveal that CH4 coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo&#8208;driven intermolecular charge migration of Fe3+ complex. The delicate coordination structure of [Fe(H2O)5OH]2+ complex ensures the selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH4. The produced Fe2+ can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H2 production, and then turns back into Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable recycle system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1), which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.</dc:description>

A [Cu&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS]&#8208;SePh species is characterized by its 77Se NMR spectra, which gives a chemical shift at &#948; 462 ppm. Moreover, a {[Cu&#8208;(R)&#8208;TOL&#8208;BINAP]&#8208;SePh}2 species is characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, which confirms the formation of Cu&#8208;Se bond in the reaction.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and&#160;Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with&#160;Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein discover that a nickel catalytic system with a modified SPINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol)&#8208;phosphoramidite as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling reaction between tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines to occur in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99.9% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor up to &gt; 200. The reaction employs a free hydroxyl in a strained&#8208;ring system as the leaving group without additional activation and can render the strained&#8208;ring untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to achieve the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8211;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8211;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8211;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8211;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8211;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8211;linked with S&#8211;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy&#160;to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Phase WO3 Cocatalysts on Hierarchical Si&#8208;based Photocathode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Li Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical lithium (Li)&#160;extraction can be expected to provide a useful recycle of Li+ from waste Li&#8208;containing battery, but the process is limited by the photocathodes with poor Li+ absorption and low yield rate. Here, we have designed a hierarchical silicon (Si)&#8208;based photocathode with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide (WO3)&#160;cocatalysts for photoelectrochemical Li extraction under 1 sun illumination, achieving a high Li yield rate of 223.0 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 91.9% at 0.0817 V versus Li(0/+) redox couple. The WO3 cocatalysts with the mixture of amorphous and crystalline phase accelerates the Li+ insertion and precipitation&#160;and enriches the concentration of Li+ at the photocathode surface. This robust photoelectrochemical Li extraction system provides a new insight on designing green and efficient route for cyclic utilization of Li resources in the sustainable energy field.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylation of Acetylene without Salt Waste: Green Synthesis of C4 Chemicals Enabled by a CO2&#8208;Pressure Induced Acidity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent formation of salt waste in C&#8208;H carboxylations is a key obstacle precluding the utilization of CO2 as C1 building block in the industrial synthesis of base chemicals. This challenge is addressed in a circular process for the production of the C4 base chemical dimethyl succinate from CO2 and acetylene. At moderate CO2 pressures, acetylene is doubly carboxylated in the presence of cesium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the C&#8208;C triple bond stabilizes the product against decarboxylation. By increasing the CO2 pressure to 70 bar, the medium is reversibly acidified, allowing an esterification of the succinate salt with methanol. The cesium base and the hydrogenation catalyst are regenerated and can be reused. This provides the proof of concept for a salt&#8208;free route to C4 chemicals from biogas (CH4/CO2). The origin of this reversible acidity switch and the critical roles of the cesium base and the NMP/MeOH solvents were elucidated by thermodynamic modeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Polyhydroxylated Steroids by an Unsaturation&#8208;Functionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain possess a wide spectrum of biological functions and remain significant synthetic challenges. Herein we have applied an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy and developed a synthetic method in addressing the C19&#8208;hydroxylation issue for efficient synthesis of polyhydroxylated steroids. An effective asymmetric dearomative cyclization allowed the construction of the C19&#8208;hydroxy unsaturated steroidal skeleton in only 4 steps from the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal 7. A synthetic sequence featured C3&#8208;OH directed hydrogenation/epoxidation, m&#8208;CPBA triggered epoxidation/S N 2&#8217; nucleophilic substitution, Birch reduction of enone, and regioselective LiAlH4 reduction furnished the polyhydroxy functionalities on the steroid skeleton in high stereochemical control and efficiency, which has ultimately enabled the&#160;total synthesis of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin in 18 and 19 overall steps, respectively. The syntheses of these polyhydroxylated steroids has offered synthetic versatility and practicality in search for new therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotions integrated into one individual system, are high&#8208;level intelligent behavioral characteristics of living organisms and are the scientific hotspot of bionic soft actuators. Here, we report a light&#8208;fueled soft actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable movements based on a Seifert ribbon bounded by a Hopf link. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and the actuation component becomes either a discontinuous strip&#8208;like structure or a continuous toroidal structure, which can realize adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions. The two motion modes are applied to the self&#8208;oscillatory piezoelectric generation and self&#8208;rotational work multiplication of cargo transport, respectively. The unique smartness of Seifert surface topology advances the level of actuation intelligence with broad implications for the adaptability, multifunctionality, and autonomy of soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but the tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicine is present at current stage. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed as Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme is featured with multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in the stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozyme to treat hypertension; but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.</dc:description>

Nanozymes that can regulate the cellular redox status by mimicking the antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells are of great therapeutic significance in oxidative stress&#8208;mediated disorders. As the distinction of physiological oxidative stress (oxidative eustress) and pathological oxidative stress (oxidative distress) occurs at a fine borderline, it is a great challenge to design nanozymes that can differentially sense the two extremes in cells, tissues and organs and mediate appropriate redox chemical reactions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes and their biomedical applications. We highlight the therapeutic significance of the antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes in various diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting aptamer AS1411 via parahydrogen. For that, we screened for suitable parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) labels, performed solid phase synthesis to incorporate the label into AS1411 and adapted the polarity of DNA via PEGylation to enable efficient, selective hydrogenation in organic solvents without effecting canonical nucleotides.







Abstract
Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.

         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene derivatives with perylene diimide tethers have been shown to form aggregates in nonpolar organic solvents that undergo a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer on complexation with a cationic amino acid ethyl ester. The chiral transfer only occurs when the chiral inducer exceeds a threshold concentration, with significant gabs values of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2 observed.







Abstract
Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (gabs) of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, namely, the chiral induction does not occur in the low concentration range of cAA&#8208;OEt but is triggered when cAA&#8208;OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the Rp and Sp conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect. When adding enantiopure cAA&#8208;OEt first to the threshold concentration and then adding an equal amount of the antipodal cAA&#8208;OEt to give cAA&#8208;OEt in racemic form, CD spectra having the same sign as the CD induced by first adding pure cAA&#8208;OEt were induced, thus showing an unprecedented &#8220;first come, first served&#8221; effect.

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exfoliated laminar iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymer (PFePc) nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) are designed as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Comprehensive variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy measurements further reveal the rapid ORR kinetics of the prepared 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant. This protocol allows the dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance to construct natural and unnatural pyrroloindole dimers and dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold linking two turn structures.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation to be performed in a flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized&#8208;molecules as drug candidates.

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling&#8208;up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.

&lt;p&gt;A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling-up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value-added chemicals at lab-scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order reaction kinetics and a high space-time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite&#8208;free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.







Abstract
The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300&#8197;h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF&#8208;based CO2 electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge&#8208;transporting framework.







Abstract
Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop=4.1&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance (
=59.5&#8197;&#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO=80&#8201;%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000 fared a poor FECO=24&#8201;% (Dhop=1.4&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 
=91.4&#8197;&#937;). For such a decoupling strategy, careful choice of the host framework is critical in pairing up with the underlying electrochemical properties of the catalysts to facilitate the charge delivery for its activation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoplatform ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL for photodynamic therapy by conjugating 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a 2D Hf12&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanophotosensitizer (Hf&#8208;MOL). Upon endocytosis, ALA is released from Hf&#8208;MOL and accumulates in mitochondria for porphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, while Hf&#8208;MOL is retained in lysosomes. Light irradiation excites both PpIX and Hf&#8208;MOL to elicit potent cytotoxicity and antitumor responses.







Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630&#8197;nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate singlet oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.

         <dc:description>
Bright multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with high device performance are prepared by adoping triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) as single emissive layer.







Abstract
Two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through solvothermal treatment, taking advantage of the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent based on siRNA&#8208;embedded iron nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) is reported. The degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs to Fe2+ and siRNA occurs in acidic endo/lysosomes and is promoted by oxygen depletion&#8208;caused intracellular pH decrease. In addition to initiating CDT, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) siRNA, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.







Abstract
Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable single&#8208;layer 2D assemblies of AuI&#8208;thiolate, with both long&#8208;range molecular order and a uniform triangular morphology, have been synthesized, and their elastic and anisotropic curling upon external stimuli has been achieved in single&#8208;assembly level.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly stable two&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular AuI&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydithioacetals depolymerize to a mixture of macrocycles that regenerates the parent polymers via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization. When crosslinked, they demonstrate covalent adaptable network (CAN) behavior at elevated temperatures. The swollen CANs are also depolymerizable to macrocycles, which are polymerized back to the CANs. Polydithioacetals are thus desirable candidates as chemically recyclable thermoplastics and thermosets.







Abstract
In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To leverage the oxygen produced from the avoidable side reaction of oxygen evolution in Ni&#8208;Zn battery, an air&#8208;breathing cathode is constructed by coupling oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with the Ni(OH)2 cathode. Benefiting from the stabilizing effects on the electrolyte and electrodes, this novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB) exhibits an ultralong lifespan and ultrahigh energy efficiency (85&#8201;%), superior to Ni&#8208;Zn battery and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB).







Abstract
Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such a novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85&#8201;% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54&#8201;%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84&#8201;% at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines were synthesized in one operation from readily accessible &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes with complete regiochemical control and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of the indolizinium alkaloid anibamine B was accomplished featuring this novel pyridine synthesis as a key step.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] heteroannulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oximes and their derivatives with alkynes has been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes are used. We report herein the unprecedented synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal [5+1] heteroannulation of two readily accessible building blocks. A copper&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes affords ynimines, which, without isolation, undergo an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines. Terminal alkynes served as a one&#8208;carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation. Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, was accomplished featuring this reaction as a key step.

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.

         <title>Quantifying the Contribution of Hot Electrons in Photothermal Catalysis: A Case Study of Ammonia Synthesis over Carbon&#8208;supported Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalysis is one of the most promising green catalytic technologies, while distinguishing the effects of hot electrons and local heating remains challenging. Herein, we reported that the actual reaction temperature of photothermal ammonia synthesis over carbon&#8208;supported Ru catalyst can be measured based on Le Chatelier's principle, enabling the hot&#8208;electron contribution to be quantified. By excluding local heating effects, we established that the activation energy via photothermal catalysis was much lower than that of thermocatalysis (54.9 vs. 126.0 kJ mol&#8208;1), stemming from hot&#8208;electron injection lowering the energy barriers for both N2 dissociation and intermediates hydrogenation. Furthermore, hot&#8208;electron injection acted to suppress carbon support methanation, giving the catalyst outstanding operational stability over 1000 h. This work provides new insights into the hot&#8208;electron effects in ammonia synthesis, guiding the design of high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Elastin&#8208;Like Peptide&#8208;Based Targeted Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spheroid Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe here a near infrared light&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like peptide (ELP)&#8208;based targeted nanoparticle (NP) that can rapidly switch its size from 120 to 25 nm upon photo&#8208;irradiation. Interestingly, the targeting function, which is crucial for effective cargo delivery, is preserved after transformation. The NPs are assembled from (targeted) diblock ELP micelles encapsulating photosensitizer TT1&#8208;monoblock ELP conjugates. Methionine residues in this monoblock are photo&#8208;oxidized by singlet oxygen generated from TT1, turning the ELPs hydrophilic and thus trigger NP dissociation. Phenylalanine residues from the diblocks then interact with TT1 via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inducing the re&#8208;formation of smaller NPs. Due to their small size and targeting function, the NPs penetrate deeper in spheroids and kill cancer cells more efficiently compared to the larger ones. This work could contribute to the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; nanomedicines with deeper penetration capacity for effective anticancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of a P450 Dimerase Enables the Collective Biosynthesis of Heterodimeric Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Diketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) are an important class of bioactive secondary metabolites. Biosynthesis offers a practical opportunity to access their bioactive structural diversity, however, it is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKPs&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Herein, by genome mining and investigation of the sequence&#8208;product relationships, we unveiled three important residues (F387, F388 and E73) in these P450s that are pivotal for selecting different diketopiperazine (DKP) substrates in the upper binding pocket. Engineering these residues in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis, including 12 self&#8208;dimerized and at least 81 cross&#8208;dimerized HTDKPs. Structural and molecular dynamics analysis of F387G and E73S revealed that they control the substrate specificity via reducing steric hindrance and regulating substrate tunnels, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Molten Salt Method for Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;rich Cathode towards Single&#8208;crystalline Li&#8208;rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With ever&#8208;increasing pursuit for high&#8208;value output in recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures. Herein, we first upcycle spent polycrystal LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2 (S&#8208;NCA) to high value&#8208;added single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a simple but feasible LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 eutectic molten salt strategy. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction technique and a series of paratactic experiments record the evolution process of upcycling and prove that excessive Li occupies the transition metal (TM) layers. Beneficial from the single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich nature, the regenerated NCA (R&#8208;NCA) exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high&#8208;rate performance and low polarization. This approach can also be successfully extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied degree of Li loss.</dc:description>

Beneficial from the single-crystalline and Li-rich nature, the regenerated NCA (R-NCA) exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of long-term cyclability, high-rate performance and low polarization. This approach can also be successfully extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied degree of Li loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4(C) SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8208;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4(C) sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of Antibody Activity by Controlling Its Dynamics Using the Glycan&#8211;Lectin Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody dynamics on membranes, such as endocytosis and clustering, are vital in determining antibody functions. In this study, we demonstrated that glycan conjugation can modulate antibody dynamics through the glycan&#8208;lectin interaction to regulate its potency. The anti&#8208;HER2 antibody, an anti&#8208;breast cancer antibody, was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to enhanced complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. This glycan&#8208;antibody conjugate is proposed as a new approach to modulate antibody activity and may provide an alternative strategy for redeveloping antibody drugs that do not exhibit sufficient activity.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Fluorogenic RNA Nanozipper Enables Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Single Viral mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time visualization of individual viral mRNA translation activities in live cells is essential to obtain critical details of viral mRNA dynamics and to detect its transient responses to environmental stress. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are powerful tools for real&#8208;time imaging of mRNA in live cells, but monitoring the translation activity of individual mRNAs remains a challenge due to their intrinsic photophysical properties. Here, we develop a genetically encoded turn&#8208;on 3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)&#8208;binding RNA nanozipper with superior brightness and high photostability by in situ self&#8208;assembly of multiple nanozippers along single mRNAs. The nanozipper enables real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translational elongation rate of viral mRNAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Communication and Protocell&#8208;Matrix Dynamics in Segregated Colloidosome Micro&#8208;Colonies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell&#8208;like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus&#8208;like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for proximity&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme&#8208;mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell&#8208;environment interactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Ferrocyanide Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy and Low&#8208;cost Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, their commercial success relies on redox&#8208;active materials (RAM) with high electron storage capacity and cost competitiveness.&#160;Herein, a redox&#8208;active material lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]) is designed.Li+ ions not only greatly boost the solubility of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; to 2.32 M at room temperature due to weak intermolecular interactions, but also improves the electrochemical performance of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8208;. By coupling with Zn, ZIRFBs were built, and the capacity of the batteries was as high as 61.64 Ah/L (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28 Ah/L (alkaline) at a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; concentration of 2.30 M and 2.10 M. These represent unprecedentedly high [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; concentrations and battery energy densities reported to date. Moreover, benefiting from the low cost of Li4[Fe(CN)6], the overall chemical cost of alkaline ZIRFB is as low as $11 per kWh, which is one&#8208;twentieth that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art VFB ($211.54 per kWh). This work breaks through the limitations of traditional electrolyte composition optimization and will strongly promote the development of economical [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8208;&#8208;based RFBs in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Mediated &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Enhances the Photodynamic Properties of a NIR&#8208;II Emitting Photosensitizer with Extended Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted great research interest due to their promising clinical applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to realize highly efficient PDT on NIR&#8208;II PSs. In this work, we develop a chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8208;&#960; organizing strategy to improve the PDT of a PS with conjugation&#8208;extended A&#8208;D&#8208;A architecture. The significant dipole moment of the carbon&#8722;chlorine bond and the strong intermolecular interactions of chlorine atoms bring on compact &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the chlorine&#8208;substituted PS, which facilitates energy/charge transfer and promotes the photochemical reactions of PDT. Consequently, the resultant NIR&#8208;II emitting PS exhibits a leading PDT performance with a yield of reactive oxygen species higher than the previously reported long&#8208;wavelength PSs. These findings will enlighten the future design of NIR&#8208;II emitting PSs with enhanced PDT efficiency.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This study describes the development of a new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic (RSH) film that is facilely coated on various substrates using a single&#8208;step process, while the versatility of this RSH film offers a reliable solution for efficient formation of complex and robust interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) in 3D electronic systems. The excellent spatial controllability of surface amine modification enables the generation of vertical circuits in&#8208;situ, providing a distinct way to connect circuits located on different layers. Moreover, the inherent superhydrophobicity and porosity exhibit the required anti&#8208;fouling and breathability properties, making the RSH&#8208;based IEC well&#8208;suited for applications where exposure to environmental gas and liquid contaminants is likely. This approach provides another avenue towards the development of IEC in 3D flexible integrated electronics, opening up new possibilities for the advancement of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic catalyst enables rapid and efficient production of polymers using low energy visible light by leveraging a unique charge transfer mechanism. This mechanism relies on communication between connected, yet electronically decoupled units, which is facilitated by twisting one unit out of plane. This discovery is anticipated to enable the rapid and energy efficient production of plastics through emergent 3D printing technology.@zakpage, @ZPageGroup, @RobertsGroupUT







Abstract
The use of visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8211;Liquid and Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nanoparticles have been dispersed in water under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by coupling to a dissipative reaction network that consumes a fuel at a controlled rate. The transient dispersed state enables autonomous solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid back&#8211;and&#8211;forth phase cycling of gold nanoparticles on a timescale that is easily adjusted by changing the pH value.







Abstract
Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting the pH value, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and numerous approved drugs act by either stimulating or blocking receptor activation. However, the design of ligands that modulate GPCR signaling is challenging. We demonstrate that molecular simulations of GPCRs can be used to predict ligand efficacy and identify potent &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor agonists.







Abstract
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using sensitive 19F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein&#8208;protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human&#8208;derived proteins in their native conditions.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8211;40&#8197;kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.

         <title>Coordinating the Edge Defects of Bismuth with Sulfur for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, they poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains challenging. In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO2RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&#8208; Faraday efficiency of ~95% and an HCOO&#8208; partial current of ~250 mA cm&#8208;2 under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination&#8208;unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption. This work deepens our understanding of ECO2RR mechanism on bismuth&#8208;based catalysts, guiding for the design of advanced ECO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Growing ZIF&#8208;8 Seeds on Charged COF Substrates toward Efficient Propylene&#8208;Propane Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged COF nanosheets are used as nuclei&#8208;deposition substrate (NDS) to generate MOF@COF nanosheet seeds, which enables the fabrication of ultrathin, defect&#8208;free MOF membranes by secondary growth.







Abstract
We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100&#8197;nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trimer&#8208;based dynamic framework with a complex 3D channel network has been constructed through reversible dynamic covalent linking chemistry of tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned aryldicyanomethyl radical building blocks. Due to the conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;mediated reaction dynamics, the system shows macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties.







Abstract
Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.

         <dc:description>
Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides has been developed. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroaminations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes were obtained using different transition metals (Cu, Ni) and chiral ligands, delivering enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacid and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivatives play an important role in biological science and pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable and yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely hindered aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;N bond forming with tertiary alkyl species. Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives have been accessed by Ni&#8722;H catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective formal hydroaminations of alkenes. This set of reactions tolerates a wide range of functional groups to deliver diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields with high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Biomolecules with Carbon Nanotubes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensors for the neurotransmitter dopamine are reported. These sensors change their fluorescence lifetime and this is measured by pulsed excitation and single&#8208;photon counting. Lifetimes are sensitive to the concentration of dopamine, which can be used for imaging dopamine release by cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are versatile near infrared (NIR) fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Their surface is chemically tailored to respond to analytes by a change in fluorescence. However, intensity&#8208;based signals are easily affected by external factors such as sample movements. Here, we demonstrate fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of SWCNT&#8208;based sensors in the NIR. We tailor a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for NIR signals (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and employ time correlated single photon counting of (GT)10&#8208;DNA functionalized SWCNTs. They act as sensors for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Their fluorescence lifetime (&gt;900&#8197;nm) decays biexponentially and the longer lifetime component (370&#8197;ps) increases by up to 25&#8201;% with dopamine concentration. These sensors serve as paint to cover cells and report extracellular dopamine in 3D via FLIM. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential of fluorescence lifetime as a readout of SWCNT&#8208;based NIR sensors.

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron redistribution strategy with Mg and F co&#8208;doping to inhibit the interfacial redox reactions between Li6PS5Cl and Li. Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li metal, and F further generates the self&#8208;limiting interface between the electrolyte and Li metal. This design enhances interfacial stability, enabling the high performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptance from Li, and F generates the self&#8208;limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2 electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times that of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3&#8201;%@100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide&#8208;based lithium batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP)&#8208;Based Straight&#8208;Shaped Diphosphine Ligands
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a method for the diphosphination of [1.1.1]propellane using visible light. Two sets of conditions were found, one using blue LED irradiation in the presence of an Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst and the other only using white LEDs. Both conditions efficiently promote radical diphosphination reactions of [1.1.1]propellane with a phosphine oxide and a chlorophosphine to afford (un)symmetrical diphosphinated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives.







Abstract
[1.1.1]Propellane, which is structurally simple and compact, exhibits promising potential for the synthesis of disubstituted straight&#8208;shaped bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) compounds by manipulation of its highly reactive internal C&#8722;C bond. BCPs are considered to be isosteres of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted benzenes, which have found broad applications in the areas of functional molecules and drug discovery. The internal C&#8722;C single bond of [1.1.1]propellane is regarded as a charge&#8208;shift bond, which can be readily cleaved by radical means to construct BCPs. We herein report a novel synthetic method for (un)symmetric diphosphines based on the BCP motif, which can be interpreted as isosteres of 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)benzenes. The obtained BCP&#8208;diphosphine derivatives were used to generate a straight&#8208;shaped Au complex and an Eu&#8208;based coordination polymer.

         <title>Ambient Preparation of Benzoxazine&#8208;based Phenolic Resins Enables Long&#8208;term Sustainable Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and exceptional benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin photocatalyst was developed for hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial active segment in resins, which accelerated the reaction kinetically through low energy barrier and favorable adsorption of oxygen and intermediates.







Abstract
Rational design of polymer structures at the molecular level promotes the iteration of high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from oxygen and water, which also lays the basis for revealing the reaction mechanism. Here we report a benzoxazine&#8208;based m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin (APFac) polymerized at ambient conditions, exhibiting superior H2O2 yield and long&#8208;term stability to most polymeric photocatalysts. Benzoxazine structure was identified as the crucial photocatalytic active segment in APFac. Favorable adsorption of oxygen/intermediates on benzoxazine structure and commendable product selectivity accelerated the reaction kinetically in stepwise single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The proposed benzoxazine&#8208;based phenolic resin provides the possibility of production in batches and industrial application, and sheds light on the de novo design and analysis of metal&#8208;free polymeric photocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Diversification of Complex Bioactive Molecules by Accelerated Synthesis in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules was achieved using an automated platform based on desorption&#8208;electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. Accelerated reactions in microdroplets enable the ultrafast synthesis of diversified drug molecules. Over 250&#8197;analogues of bioactive compounds were generated and characterized using nanogram amounts of material in less than 1&#8197;second per reaction.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1&#8197;reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1&#8197;Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene&#8208;type click reactions. Some 269&#8197;functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500&#8197;reactions.

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a superior potassium&#8208;sulfur battery performance, we elucidate the solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion pathway via meta&#8208;stable intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. It is demonstrated that the host with Cu single atom exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding, resulting in low overpotential of K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion. The resultant catalytic sulfur host demonstrates high discharge capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization of metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S32&#8722; intermediates on transition metal single&#8208;atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding results in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Membrane Electrode Assembly for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Principle and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are a promising technology to realize carbon neutrality. This review summarizes the principles and core components of the electrolyser and gives an overview of the application of MEAs in the generation of different reduced products.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is a promising technology. Gaseous CO2 can be directly transported to the cathode catalyst layer, leading to enhanced reaction rate. Meanwhile, there is no liquid electrolyte between the cathode and the anode, which can help to improve the energy efficiency of the whole system. The remarkable progress achieved recently points out the way to realize industrially relevant performance. In this review, we focus on the principles in MEA for CO2RR, focusing on gas diffusion electrodes and ion exchange membranes. Furthermore, anode processes beyond the oxidation of water are considered. Besides, the voltage distribution is scrutinized to identify the specific losses related to the individual components. We also summarize the progress on the generation of different reduced products together with the corresponding catalysts. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are highlighted for future research.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Complexes of Lanthanides and d&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review aims to catalogue all accounts of lanthanide and d&#8208;metal chiral complexes which show circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR). Recent improvements in the rational design of suitable complexes which show strong emission properties and high chiroptical activity will be discussed, as well as the setups capable of measuring NIR&#8208;CPL.







Abstract
In recent years, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has witnessed a renaissance, due to the increased popularity of CPL as a spectroscopic technique and greater accessibility to instrumentation. New efficient CPL emitters have been designed and many applications, ranging from electronic devices to microscopy have been proposed. Most examples of CPL are within the visible range, while few cases of near infrared (NIR) CPL active complexes are available. NIR&#8208;CPL compounds may have applications in the telecommunication industry, electronic devices and bioassays. In the following, we shall give an overview of the recent developments allowing for the measurements of NIR&#8208;CPL, and describe the chiroptical properties of metal complexes which achieve this feat.

         <title>Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding was proposed to design and synthesize efficient carbonyl additives to improve perovskite device performance. After systematic research, we find that molecular dipole plays an important role in determining the passivation effect of the additive molecule. Under a series of optimization, the companion efficiency of the perovskite device is 23.20&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2), 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2) and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules. The additive with strong molecular dipole possesses the advantages of enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After optimization, the companion efficiency of PSCs is 23.20&#8201;%, and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module&#8208;modified DLBA was 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). This work provides an important reference for the selection and designing of efficient carbonyl additives.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy via a Peptide&#8208;H2S Donor Conjugate with Complexed Fe2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an enzyme&#8208;triggered hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor with the Fenton reaction promoter Fe2+, we developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate&#8208;Fe2+ complex that increased levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in C6 cancer cells, providing an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive system for precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Inducing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside tumor cells is a cancer therapy method termed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Relying on delivery of Fenton reaction promoters such as Fe2+, CDT takes advantage of overproduced ROS in the tumor microenvironment. We developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate, complexed with Fe2+, termed AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+. The AAN tripeptide was specifically cleaved by legumain, an enzyme overexpressed in glioma cells, to release carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrolysis of COS by carbonic anhydrase formed H2S, an inhibitor of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies H2O2. Fe2+ and H2S together increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased viability in C6 glioma cells compared with controls lacking either Fe2+, the AAN sequence, or the ability to generate H2S. AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+ performed better than temezolimide while exhibiting no cytotoxicity toward H9C2 cardiomyocytes. This study provides an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive platform for synergistic cancer treatment.

         <title>A Recyclable and Scalable High&#8208;Capacity Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practically applicable organic electrode material is proposed for scalable aqueous batteries, which empower Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity in stacked large pouch cells. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the charge storage was carried out. The recycling of the organic electrode can be achieved at any states of charge with high yields through economical process.







Abstract
Redox organic electrode materials (OEMs) have attracted extensive attention for batteries due to the possibility to be designed with high performance. However, the practical application of OEMs requires rigor criteria such as low cost, recyclability, scalability and high performance etc. and hence seems still far away. Here, we demonstrate an OEM for high performance aqueous organic batteries. Quantification of the charge storage confirmed the storage of protons with fast reaction kinetics, thereby enabling the high performance at high mass loading. As a result, the laminated pouch cells delivered Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity with excellent cycling performance. Benefited from the small molecular nature and the stable both charged and discharged states, the electrodes can be recycled at any states of charge with high yields (more than 90&#8201;%). This work provides a substantial step in the practical applications of OEMs for the future sustainable batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unactivated Alkenes via Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Regioselective Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic resolution is a powerful strategy for the isolation of enantioenriched compounds from racemic mixtures, and the development of selective catalytic processes is an active area of research. Here, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes via the enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselective hydroamination. This protocol affords both chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted butenamides and syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantiomeric purity (up to 99% ee) and s factor up to &gt;684. The key to the excellent kinetic resolution efficiency is the distinctive architecture of the chiral nickel complex, which enables successful resolution and enantioselective C&#8211;N bond construction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the unique structure of the chiral ligand facilitates a rapid migratory insertion step with one enantiomer. This strategy provides a practical and versatile approach to prepare a wide range of chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective in Situ Analysis of Mature microRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles Using a DNA Cage&#8208;Based Thermophoretic Assay</title>

         <dc:description>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in different stages of cancer progression, yet it remains challenging to precisely detect mature miRNAs in EVs due to the presence of interfering RNAs (such as longer precursor miRNAs, pre&#8208;miRNAs) and the low abundance of tumor&#8208;associated miRNAs. By leveraging the size&#8208;selective ability of DNA cages and polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs, we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs with a low limit of detection (LoD) of 2.05 fM. Our assay can profile EV mature miRNAs directly in serum samples without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs and the need for ultracentrifugation. A clinical study showed that EV miR&#8208;21 or miR&#8208;155 had an overall accuracy of 90% for discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy donors, which outperformed conventional molecular probes detecting both mature miRNAs and pre&#8208;miRNAs. We envision that our assay can advance EV miRNA&#8208;based diagnosis of cancer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry (SEE) for investigating the intrinsic activity of plasmonic catalysts at the single&#8208;particle level using glucose electrooxidation and oxygen reduction on gold nanoparticles as model reactions. We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (EF) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the EF of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are caused by photo&#8208;induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the EF of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxysome&#8208;inspired electrocatalysis using enzymes for the reduction of CO2 at low concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolysis of dilute CO2 streams suffers from low concentrations of dissolved substrate and its rapid depletion at the electrolyte&#8208;electrocatalyst interface. These limitations require first energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture and concentration, before electrolyzers can achieve acceptable performances. For direct electrocatalytic CO2 reduction from low&#8208;concentration sources, we introduce a strategy that mimics the carboxysome in cyanobacteria by utilizing microcompartments with nanoconfined enzymes in a porous electrode. A carbonic anhydrase accelerates CO2 hydration kinetics and minimizes substrate depletion by making all dissolved carbon available for utilization, while a highly efficient formate dehydrogenase reduces CO2 cleanly to formate; down to even atmospheric concentrations of CO2. This bio&#8208;inspired concept demonstrates that the carboxysome provides a viable blueprint for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 streams to chemicals by using all forms of dissolved carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Aerobic&#8208;Hydrophobic Janus Interface on Partially Carbonized Iron Heterostructure Promotes Bifunctional Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overwhelming competition from hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and low solubility of N2 in aqueous systems drain on selectivity and activity on nitrogen fixation reaction. Herein, we design an aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic&#160;Janus structure by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The simulations prove that the Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endow a N2 molecule&#8208;concentrating effect, suppressing the competing reactions and overcoming the mass&#8208;transfer limitations to build a robust "quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;gas" state micro&#8208;domain around the catalyst surface.&#160;In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for nitrogen fixation (NH3 yield rate up to 29.2 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and Faraday efficiency (FE) up to 27.8% in NRR; NO3&#8208; yield rate up to 15.7 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and FE up to 3.4 % in NOR).</dc:description>

         <title>A Widespread Glycosidase Confers Lobophorin Resistance and Host&#8208;Dependent Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying new environmental resistance determinants is significant to combat rising antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the unexpected correlation of a lobophorin (LOB) resistance&#8208;related glycosidase KijX with the host&#8208;dependent chemical diversity of LOBs, by a process of glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation. KijX homologs are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs. The crystal structure of AcvX (a KijX homolog) shows a similar fold to that of the glycoside hydrolase family 113 and a special negatively charged groove to accommodate and deglycosylate LOBs. Antagonistic assays indicate kijX as a defense weapon of actinomycetes to combat LOB producers in environment, reflecting an elegant coevolution relationship. Our study provides insights into the KijX&#8208;related glycosidases as preexisting resistance determinants and represents an example of resistance genes accidentally integrated into natural product assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Electron Trap&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation for Efficient Photocatalytic HydrogenProduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven evolution of hydrogen from water using particulate photocatalysts is considered one of the most economical and promising protocols for achieving a stable supply of renewable energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is far from satisfactory due to the sluggish electron&#8211;hole pair separation kinetics. Herein, isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32 mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 (226.4 &#181;mol h&#8208;1; catalyst dosage 20 mg). Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here, we report a new class of peptidomimetic macrocycles with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structures and low conformational flexibility. They are assembled from fused&#8208;ring spiro&#8208;ladder oligomers (spiroligomers) by modular solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance confirms their shape persistency. Triangular macrocycles of tunable sizes assemble into membranes with atomically precise pores, which exhibit size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving towards a series of structurally similar compounds. The exceptional structural diversity and stability of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles will be explored for more applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Heterogeneous Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) enabled heterogeneous thiol catalysis has been achieved for the first time. MOF Zr&#8208;TPDCS&#8208;1, consisting of Zr6&#8208;clusters and TPDCS linkers (TPDCS = 3,3&#8217;&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramercapto[1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate), effectively catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. Upon irradiation, the fast electron transfer from TPDCS to Zr6&#8208;cluster is believed to facilitate the formation of the thiyl radical, a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, which competently abstracts the hydrogen from borane, silane, phosphine, or thiol for generating the corresponding element radical to engender the chemical transformations. The elaborate control experiments evidenced the generation of thiyl radicals in MOF and illustrated a radical reaction pathway. The gram&#8208;scale reaction worked well, and the product was conveniently separated via centrifugation and vacuum with a turnover number (TON) of ~3880, highlighting the practical application potential of heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Pulse&#8208;Driven Periodic Self&#8208;Repair of Cu&#8208;Ni Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction sustainably produces ammonia and alleviates water pollution, yet challenging due to the kinetic mismatch and hydrogen evolution competition. Cu/Cu2O heterojunction is proven effective to break the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; step for efficient NH3 conversion, while it is unstable by electrochemical reconstruction. Here we report a programmable pulsed electrolysis strategy to achieve reliable Cu/Cu2O structure, where Cu is oxidized to CuO during oxidation pulse, then regenerating Cu/Cu2O upon reduction. Alloying with Ni further modulates hydrogen adsorption, which transfers from Ni/Ni(OH)2 to N&#8208;containing intermediates on Cu/Cu2O, promoting NH3 formation with a high NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Faraday efficiency (88.0 &#177; 1.6%, pH 12) and NH3 yield rate (583.6 &#177; 2.4 &#956;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) under optimal pulsed conditions. This work provides new insights to in situ electrochemically regulate catalysts for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endosomal escape remains a central issue limiting the high protein expression of mRNA therapeutics. Here, we present second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II dye conjugated lipid (Cy&#8208;lipid) for potentiating mRNA delivery efficiencyvia stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy. In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy&#8208;lipid is protonated and turns on NIR&#8208;II absorption for light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transduction mediated by 1064 nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat&#8208;promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR&#8208;II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3&#8208;fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR&#8208;II light free group. And the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable, and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination into a commercial epoxy matrix has led to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The polymers show excellent mechanical properties, environmental stability, shape memory, and recyclability, which could be useful for anticounterfeiting, data encryption, and information editing applications.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance for practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination are incorporated into a commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultralong RTP (&#964;=540.4&#8197;ms), and shape memory behavior. Notably, there is no apparent decrease in the RTP property upon prolonged immersion in various solvents because the networks are robust. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. These novel properties have led to their potential application for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Support Boosts Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel interface chemistry manipulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) before the self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) by constructing a novel 2D/2D heterostructure composed of NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical studies verify the thermodynamically favorable process of UOR on the Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330&#8197;h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal Catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride photothermal catalyst for enabling the Solar Sabatier process is reported that reduces the energy intensity of the thermo&#8208;catalytic version, yet maintains an amazing Sabatier conversion of 87.68&#8201;%, a reaction rate of 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technology relevant level.







Abstract
To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.

In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ni&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto-chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium Deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropic contributions to the free enthalpy may significantly influence the equilibrium potential of an electrode in a battery system. By microcalorimetric measurements of Na deposition from a diglyme solution, we show that solvation entropy destabilizes the Na+ in solution by about 0.7&#8197;eV, thus strongly increasing the stability of the electrolyte solution upon Na deposition and affecting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#916;R
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 (c.f.: &#916;R
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.

         <title>Influence of Composition of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoparticles for Abiotic CO2 Conversion to Early Prebiotic Organics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high temperature and pressure, synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles catalyze H2&#8208;dependent CO2 fixation to form the main intermediates of the acetyl&#8208;CoA pathway (e.g., formate, acetate, and pyruvate). The reported chemistry is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents, which yield large amounts of H2 in the presence of transition metals and are implicated in forming the first biochemical pathways through CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8722;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway&#8212;formate, acetate, and pyruvate&#8212;in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8722;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.

         <title>Close&#8208;Shell Reductive Elimination versus Open&#8208;Shell Radical Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activations by Computation and Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of site&#8208;selectivity for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and arylation have been illuminated by means of density functional theory calculations. The competition between close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and open&#8208;shell radical attack is responsible for the ortho&#8208; versus meta&#8208;selectivity, for which a multi&#8208;linear regression model, predicting the site&#8208;selection, was devised and tested experimentally.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8722;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8722;H scission and the C&#8722;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective activation of PtIV prodrugs upon irradiation is receiving much interest. The majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection and were able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide&#8208;stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size&#8208; and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host.

&lt;p&gt;We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide-stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near-infrared light-emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size- and composition-tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near-infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light-emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum-cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126&#8201;% from the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs. Through halide-composition engineering and surface passivation to improve both PLQY and charge-transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;% at a central wavelength of 990&#8197;nm, representing the most efficient perovskite-based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.







Abstract
We describe an aromatic amide skeleton for manipulation of triplet excited states toward bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive 3(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non&#8208;radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of 3(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.

         <title>A Cooperative Rhodium/Secondary Phosphine Oxide [Rh/P(O)nBu2] Template for Catalytic Hydrodefluorination of Perfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination of perfluoroarenes is presented. Aside from substrates with electron&#8208;withdrawing functionalities, the system showed a high tolerance for challenging electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. Mechanistic studies and a density functional theory study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride as a catalytic species and the critical role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment.







Abstract
The selective activation of C&#8722;F bonds under mild reaction conditions remains an ongoing challenge of bond activation. Here, we present a cooperative [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of perfluoroarenes. In addition to substrates presenting electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, the system showed an exceedingly rare tolerance for electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Empirical mechanistic studies and a density functional theory (DFT) study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride complex as a catalytically relevant species and the determining role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment. Altogether, we demonstrate that molecular templates based on these design elements can be assembled to create catalysts with increased reactivity for challenging bond activations.

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by the Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid Additive for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage stability of NCM622 is realized by armor&#8208;like CEI via electrolyte engineering, where the armored lithium borate surrounded on the CEI surface represses the dissolution of CEI moieties and improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed across whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathode could potentially realize high capacity and power density. However, suitable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8&#8197;V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded by CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects in a Distannene/Tristannane Equilibrium: Energies of their Interconversion and the Suppression of the Monomeric Stannylene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3, affords an equilibrium mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2, and cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3, which suppresses monomer dissociation. Multinuclear NMR and computational analyses indicated that DED interactions are the main arbiter of the dimer&#8208;trimer thermal interconversion.







Abstract
Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#8901;Et2O}2 (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).

&lt;p&gt;Reaction of {LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2,4,6-Cyp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6-triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2,4,6-Cyp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2,4,6-Cyp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; conversion has a &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which gives a &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;300 K&lt;/sup&gt;=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, showing that the conversion of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per {Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;2,4,6-Cyp&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit, which exceeds the DED energy in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; equilibrium. Both &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a catalytic process of nickel&#8208;promoted electrochemical graphitization in the molten calcium chloride. Multi&#8208;scale approach from atomic reactions to macroscale cells is useful in understanding the mechanism of evolution in the electrolytic cell, the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the pathways of nickel&#8208;promoted graphitization and tubularization.







Abstract
Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow CdS nanocages wrapped in ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were synthesized to form the hierarchical photocatalyst ZnIn2S4@CdS. Surface&#8208;exposed Zn acid centers and the Z&#8208;Scheme pathway between ZnIn2S4 and CdS promote the polarization of epoxide molecules and interfacial charge transfer, leading to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alcoholysis of epoxides.







Abstract
Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8722;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8722;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.

Naphthospironone A, a cytotoxic and antibacterial natural product, was synthesised for the first time. The key to construction of its spiro[bicyclo[3.2.1]octane&#8208;pyran] core was a two&#8208;step sequence involving hydrogenolytic debrominative olefin migration followed by a base&#8208;induced intramolecular aldol&#8208;type cyclisation.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions through Sulfur&#8208;Anchoring of Metal Catalysts on Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI phenomenons enabled carbon to synthesize a variety of catalysts with enhanced performance.







Abstract
In supported metal catalysts, the supports would strongly interact with the metal components instead of just acting as a carrier, which greatly affects both of their synthesis and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Carbon is considered as very important but inert support and thus hard to induce strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI between metal and sulfur&#8208;doped carbon (S&#8722;C) supports enables the catalysts with extraordinary resistance to sintering at high temperatures of up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, which allows the general synthesis of single&#8208;atom, alloy cluster, and intermetallic compound catalysts with high dispersion and metal loading for a variety of applications.

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates by Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.







Abstract
The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.

&lt;p&gt;In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene-dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene-dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene-dioxide (BTO-TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2-(4-carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene-dioxide (BTO-OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L&#8208;proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines.







Abstract
Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with l&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the l&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Extracting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs as emerging crystalline porous materials have shown great potential for water harvesting, as their high porosity and exposed polar sites promote the sorption of water and penetrative pore channels accelerate water diffusions. Various strategies of designing high&#8208;performance COF sorbents in thermodynamics and dynamics are presented by accentuating the critical relationships between structures and water sorption properties.







Abstract
Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue due to global population growth and industrialization. One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF&#8208;based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF&#8208;based SAWH systems.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Zinc Adeninate Framework (ZAF) for Immobilization of Catalytic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective immobilization and delivery of genetic materials is at the forefront of biological and medical research directed toward tackling scientific challenges such as gene therapy, and cancer treatment. Here we present a biologically inspired hydrogen bonded zinc adeninate framework (ZAF) consisting of zinc adeninate macrocycles that self&#8208;assemble into a 3D framework via adenine&#8208;adenine interactions. ZAF can efficiently immobilize DNAzyme with full protection against enzyme degradation and physiological conditions until it is successfully delivered into the nucleus. Compared to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZAFs are 2&#8208;folds more biocompatible with a significant loading efficiency of 96%. Overall, our design paves the way for expanding functional hydrogen&#8208;bonded&#8208;based systems as potential platforms for the loading and delivery of biologics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;specific Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) Copolymers via Chemoselective Terpolymerization Controlled by the Stoichiometric Ratio of Phosphazene/Triethylborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoselective terpolymerization can produce polymer materials with diverse compositions and sequential structures, and thus have attracted considerable attention in the field of polymer synthesis. However, the intrinsic complexity of three&#8208;component system also brings great chanllenge, in regard to the reactivity and selectivity of different monomers. Herein, we report the terpolymerization of CO2/epoxide/anhydride by a binary organocatalytic C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB (triethylborane) system. Both the activity and chemoselectivity were highly dependent upon the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3 to TEB, and sequence&#8208;controlled poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers were readily synthesized through one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step methodology by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of phosphazene/TEB. In particular, C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 exhibited an unprecedentedly high chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CO2/CHO. Thus, well&#8208;defined triblock polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers can be produced from the mixture of CO2, CHO and PA using a bifunctional initiator. With C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB = 1/1, tapered copolymers were obtained, while random copolymers with high content of polycarbonate (PC) were synthesized with further increasing the amount of TEB. The mechanism of the unexpected chemoselectivity was further investigated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phosphorescence of organic materials is highly dependent on intermolecular interactions, for the sensitive triplet excitons toward environment and aggregated structures. However, until now, relationship between phosphorescence and intermolecular interactions is still unclear for complicated influence factors and uncontrollable aggregated behaviors. Herein, taking temperature as the controlled variable, the afterglow can continuously change from blue to green, then to yellow, even achieve the white emission with deuteration process. It is mainly due to the hierarchical architectures of molecular aggregates with rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, as well as gradually unlocking process of interactions with different energies.

         <title>Exploiting Reusable Edge&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Free Polyphthalocyanine Networks for Efficient Polymer Synthesis at Near Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts are highly advantageous for industrial applications owing to their distinctive merits including easy separation and effective recovery. However, utilizing heterogeneous photocatalysts to harness longer wavelength light remains a critical area of research. This contribution explores the use of edge&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;x) to promote efficient polymer synthesis under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Our screening process revealed that both phenyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;p) and naphthyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;n) offer promising performance for photopolymerization. With the assistance of ppm&#8208;level PPc&#8208;n catalyst, well&#8208;defined polymers were synthesized within a few hours under the regulation of three NIR lights, regardless of shielded by synthetic and biological barriers. An excellent control over the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was achieved. Furthermore, PPc&#8208;x can be easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles, with negligible leaching and maintenance of the catalytic performance. This study expands a new avenue in developing versatile photocatalysts for the modern synthetic toolkits and offer benefits in diverse applications.</dc:description>

This contribution explores the use of edge-functionalized metal-free polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc-x) to promote efficient polymer synthesis under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Our screening process revealed that both phenyl-edged PPc-x (PPc-p) and naphthyl-edged PPc-x (PPc-n) offer promising performance for photopolymerization. With the assistance of ppm-level PPc-n catalyst, well-defined polymers were synthesized within a few hours under the regulation of three NIR lights, regardless of shielded by synthetic and biological barriers. An excellent control over the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was achieved. Furthermore, PPc-x can be easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles, with negligible leaching and maintenance of the catalytic performance. This study expands a new avenue in developing versatile photocatalysts for the modern synthetic toolkits and offer benefits in diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modern Strategies for Carbon Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to stable and natural abundant carbon&#8208;12, the synthesis of organic molecules with carbon (radio)isotopes must be conceived and optimized in order to navigate through the hurdles of radiochemical requirements, such as high costs of the starting materials, harsh conditions and radioactive waste generation. In addition, it must initiate from the small cohort of available C&#8208;labeled building blocks. For long time, multi&#8208;step approaches have represented the sole available patterns. On the other side, the development of chemical reactions based on the reversible cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds might offer new opportunities and reshape retrosynthetic analysis in radiosynthesis. This review aims to provide a short survey on the recently emerged carbon isotope exchange (CIE) technologies that provide effective opportunity for late&#8208;stage labeling. At present, such strategies have relied on the use of primary and easily accessible radiolabeled C1&#8208;building blocks, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and cyanides, while the activation principles have been based on thermal, photocatalytic, metal&#8208;catalyzed and biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aminocyclobutane Monoesters: Synthesis and Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported. The obtained strained rings undergo (4+2) dearomative annulation with indole partners using silylium catalysis. This organocatalyzed annulation provided tricyclic indolines with four new stereocenters in up to quantitative yield and &gt;95:5 diastereoselectivity and can proceed both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction. This divergent outcome could be rationalized based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Minor Actinides Can Replace Essential Lanthanides in Bacterial Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last decade, the biological relevance of certain f&#8208;elements &#8211; the lanthanides &#8211; was established in the context of methylotrophic bacteria. The respective strains incorporate these 4f&#8209;elements into the active site of one of their key metabolic enzymes, a lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase. Here, we investigate if actinides, the radioactive 5f&#8209;elements, can replace the essential 4f&#8208;elements in lanthanide&#8208;dependent bacterial metabolism. Growth studies with Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV and the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 &#916;mxaF&#8208;mutant demonstrate that americium and curium support growth in the absence of lanthanides. Moreover, strain SolV favors these actinides over late lanthanides, when presented to a mixture of equal amounts of lanthanides together with americium and curium. Bacterial uptake is confirmed by time&#8208;resolved laser&#8208;induced fluorescence spectroscopy, liquid scintillation counting, and inductively&#8208;coupled plasma mass&#8208;spectrometry. Additionally, we show catalytic activity of the lanthanide&#8208;dependent enzyme upon reconstitution with actinides. Our combined in&#160;vivo and in vitro results establish that methylotrophic bacteria can utilize actinides instead of lanthanides to sustain their one&#8208;carbon metabolism; if they possess the correct size and a +III oxidation state. Furthermore, bacteria capable of utilizing actinides will be able to mobilize these elements in the environment. This may lead to applications for bioremediation and recycling/separation of lanthanides and actinides.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials ~250 mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the CO Oxidation Mechanism over a Molecularly Defined Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis is critically important for catalyst development, yet remains challenging because of the often unclear nature of the active sites. Using a molecularly defined copper single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on a UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu/UiO&#8208;66), allows a detailed mechanistic elucidation of the CO oxidation reaction. Based on a combination of in situ / operando spectroscopies, kinetic measurements including kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory&#8208;based calculations, we identified the active site, reaction intermediates, and transition states of the dominant reaction cycle as well as the changes in oxidation/spin state during reaction. The reaction involves the continuous reactive dissociation of adsorbed O2, by reaction of O2,ad with COad, leading to the formation of an O atom connecting the Cu center with a neighboring Zr4+ ion as rate limiting step. This is removed in a second activated step.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Using a Fluorescence Nanoprobe for the Detection and Imaging of Phosphorylation and Glucose Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring the early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) without plaque formation is of great significance. Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF with iodine (I3&#8208;)&#8208;rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint Zr(IV) and I3&#8208;&#8208;RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non&#8208;plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two&#8208;photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Essential Amino Acids from Nitric Oxide Using Atomically Dispersed Fe on N&#8208;doped Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to transfer industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;values product is significantly important and challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative method for artificial synthesis of essential &#945;&#8208;amino acids from nitric oxide (NO) by reacting with &#945;&#8208;keto acids through electrocatalytic process with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (AD&#8208;Fe/NC) as the catalyst. A yield of valine with 32.1 &#956;mol mgcat&#8208;1 is delivered at &#8211;0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding a selectivity of 11.3%. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy analyses show that NO as nitrogen source converted to hydroxylamine that promptly nucleophilic attacked on the electrophilic carbon center of &#945;&#8208;keto acid to form oxime and subsequent reductive hydrogenation occurred on the way to amino acid. Over 6 kinds of &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been successfully synthesized and gaseous nitrogen source can be also replaced by liquid nitrogen source (NO3&#8208;). Our findings not only provide a creative method for converting nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;valued products, which is of epoch&#8208;making significance towards artificial synthesis of amino acids, but also benefit in deploying near&#8208;zero&#8208;emission technologies for global environmental and economic development.</dc:description>

         <title>The Elusive Structure of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride Determined by Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat allergy symptoms and long&#8208;term hives for over 25 years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/microelectron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcased the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED) for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane with a High Donor Additive for Efficient Anode Reversibility in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries is improved by regulating the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Pyridine (Py) as high donor number organic electrolyte additive (only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition) is used to efficiently regulate the solvation sheath structure, which results in depressed H2O activity at the IHP interface. The thus&#8208;formed IHP interface enables a superior stable Zn anode with high reversibility and utilization rate.







Abstract
The performance of aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) is highly dependent on inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) chemistry. Notorious parasitic reactions containing hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and Zn dendrites both originate from abundant free H2O and random Zn deposition inside active IHP. Here, we report a universal high donor number (DN) additive pyridine (Py) with only 1&#8197;vol.&#8201;% addition (Py&#8208;to&#8208;H2O volume ratio), for regulating molecule distribution inside IHP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation verify that incorporated Py additive could tailor Zn2+ solvation sheath and exclude H2O molecules from IHP effectively, which is in favor of preventing H2O decomposition. Consequently, even at extreme conditions such as high depth of discharge (DOD) of 80&#8201;%, the symmetric cell based on Py additive can sustain approximately 500&#8197;h long&#8208;term stability. This efficient strategy with high DN additives furnishes a promising direction for designing novel electrolytes and promoting the practical application of AZIBs, despite inevitably introducing trace organic additives.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free NiOx Nanocrystals: A Low&#8208;cost and Stable Hole Transport Material for Commercializing Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective hole transport material in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, Zhang et&#8197;al. summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs and their applications in different perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Advancing inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for commercial applications given their compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics, low&#8208;temperature processability (&#8804;100&#8201;&#176;C), and promising operational stability. Although inverted PSCs have achieved an efficiency of over 25&#8201;% using doped or expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs), their synthesis cost and stability still cannot meet the requirements for their commercialization. Recently, dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective HTM in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, we summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs. Then, the applications of NiOx NCs in other perovskite optoelectronics beyond photovoltaics are discussed. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future development of NiOx NCs for the commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Approaching Theoretical Performances of Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Cobalt&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts is studied through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic methods. When cathodically biased, a reconstruction in the symmetry of Co&#8722;Nx active sites is discovered, which leads to a shift in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction selectivity from producing water to hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for environmentally benign applications. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of catalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;pathway selectivity. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on a series of CoNx/carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach based on an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that aims to create the maximum number of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer towards the 2&#8201;e&#8722; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>A Hydrogel Microneedle Assay Combined with Nucleic Acid Probes for On&#8208;Site Detection of Small Molecules and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have developed a versatile microneedle (MN) biosensor applicable for detecting various clinical biomarkers&#8211;present in interstitial fluid&#8211;on&#8208;site and near a patient's point of care. Our MN&#8208;based biosensor has displayed accurate and reliable results at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo settings when compared to benchmark assays. The developed MN paves the way for better health management and timely treatment.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive and follow&#8208;upprocessing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in vivo.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Pure Isotropic Proton Solid State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning on three&#8208;dimensional variable spinning rate datasets provides a powerful method to obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H two&#8208;dimensional NMR spectra in rigid organic solids by removing broadening due to dipolar interactions.







Abstract
One key bottleneck of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is that 1H NMR spectra of organic solids are often very broad due to the presence of a strong network of dipolar couplings. We have recently suggested a new approach to tackle this problem. More specifically, we parametrically mapped errors leading to residual dipolar broadening into a second dimension and removed them in a correlation experiment. In this way pure isotropic proton (PIP) spectra were obtained that contain only isotropic shifts and provide the highest 1H NMR resolution available today in rigid solids. Here, using a deep&#8208;learning method, we extend the PIP approach to a second dimension, and for samples of L&#8208;tyrosine hydrochloride and ampicillin we obtain high resolution 1H&#8208;1H double&#8208;quantum/single&#8208;quantum dipolar correlation and spin&#8208;diffusion spectra with significantly higher resolution than the corresponding spectra at 100&#8197;kHz MAS, allowing the identification of previously overlapped isotropic correlation peaks.

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in a Supported Copper/ZnO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of formation of alcohol&#8208;induced strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) on the surface of a Cu/ZnO catalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) in metal catalysts is a promising strategy to improve their catalytic performance. In this article, we systematically investigated the influences of different alcohol/water mixtures on the evolution of the interfacial structure of Cu/ZnO catalysts in the reduction stage. A series of in situ characterization and theoretical simulation studies were performed to elucidate the various mechanisms of alcohol induced SMSI. It was found that when methanol/water is added to H2 during the reduction pretreatment, more oxygen vacancies are formed on the ZnO support, which facilitates the dissociation of H2O and the hydroxylation of ZnO species. Such promotion eventually favors the SMSI between Cu and ZnO and increases the catalytic activity for the methanol steam reforming reaction. In contrast, the addition of ethanol/water and 1&#8208;propanol/water during reduction leads to a physical blockage of the catalyst by alcohol molecules, poisoning the active Cu sites and limiting the migration of ZnO species.

NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF), an important biomass&#8208;derived platform chemical, with aldimines afford chiral amines in good yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The use of a bifunctional NHC bearing a free hydroxy group enabled the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine to occur in a highly stereocontrolled manner.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Mannich&#8208;type reactions of the biomass&#8208;derived platform compound 5&#8208;(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) with imines were developed. A series of high&#8208;value&#8208;added chiral amines were afforded in good to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The bifunctional NHC derived from &#671;&#8208;pyroglutamic acid efficiently steered the remote addition of the trienolate intermediate to the imine in a highly stereocontrolled manner. This represents the first enantioselective reaction proceeding via an NHC&#8208;bound trienolate intermediate.

         <title>Functional DNA Superstructures Exhibit Positive Homotropic Allostery in Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by intrinsically disordered proteins in nature, DNA aptamers can be engineered to display strongly homotropic allosteric (or cooperative) ligand binding, represents a unique feature that could be of great utility in applications such as biosensing, imaging and drug delivery. The use of intrinsic disorder mechanism, however, comes with an inherent drawback: the overall binding affinity is significantly reduced. We hypothesize that this issue could be addressed via the design of multivalent supramolecular aptamers. To confirm this idea, we engineered a DNA aptameric assembly, which we denote &#8220;functional DNA superstructures&#8221; (3D DNA). This functional 3D DNA is made of long chain DNA containing tandem repeating DNA aptamers (or concatemeric aptamers). We demonstrate that functional 3D DNA systems exhibit highly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers. We further use this to produce a highly responsive sensor for fluorescence imaging of glutamate stimulation&#8208;evoked adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in neurons, as well as force stimulus&#8208;triggered ATP release in astrocytes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Space&#8208;Confined Polymerization Templated by Ice Enables Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of many two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space&#8208;confined polymerization method that enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898 mF cm&#8208;2 at 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2 along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6% at a 50&#8208;fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5% after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Organic&#8208;Cation Defects on Optoelectronic Properties of ASnI3 Perovskites A=HC(NH2)2, CH3NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve higher power conversion efficiency for tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites the critical role of organic defects in nonradiative recombination should be better understood. Random rotation of organic cation can suppress nonradiative carrier trapping owing to organic defects in FASnI3 [FA=HC(NH2)2], rendering the organic contributions for defect tolerance. In contrast, organic defects in MASnI3 (MA=CH3NH3) are strong and active trapping centers.







Abstract
Tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14&#8201;%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA [HC(NH2)2] in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;15&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mere introduction of a CF3 group at position&#8197;5 of a bipyridine ligand promotes a dramatic change in regioselectivity in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of benzamides and derivatives, from meta/para to ortho&#8208;substitution. Computational and experimental data suggest that this effect is associated with unusual outer&#8208;sphere dispersion interactions between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;bipy ring of the ligand.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring conjugated polymer is developed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of polythiophene backbone. The resultant polymer shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels and highly ordered crystallite structure, leading to excellent thermoelectric performance after n&#8208;doping.







Abstract
Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8722;3.91&#8197;eV/&#8722;6.22&#8197;eV, high electron mobility of 0.39&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic route of fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) was revealed by elucidating the biosynthesis of pretrichodermamide A. Diverse ETP derivatives, including 25 novel compounds, were characterized from tda gene deletion mutants, indicating divergent metabolic pathways of ETP intermediates and enzyme catalytic promiscuity.







Abstract
Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, that is, four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7&#8242;&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6&#8242;&#8208; and TdaO for C7&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of 25 novel ETPs, including 20 shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuity of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioselective benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones have been developed. The reaction proceeds via a high ordered sequence of imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;aza shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step.







Abstract
An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted piperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.

         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new macrolide lactams, which were biosynthesized by a novel gene cluster sml, were isolated from an Arctic actinomycete strain. Multiple structural elucidation approaches were integrated to determine their structures. One of the compounds was found to inhibit IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells. It inhibited the MAPK pathway and significantly protected zebrafish from LPS&#8208;induced inflammation.







Abstract
Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of MS, NMR spectroscopic analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18&#8197;&#956;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.

         <title>Molecular Lanthanide Switches for Magnetism and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C9H9)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)][(C9H9)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.







Abstract
Solvation of [(CNT)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Tb, Er; CNT=cyclononatetraenyl, i.e., C9H9&#8722;; COT=cyclooctatetraendiid, i.e., C8H82&#8722;) complexes with tetrahydrofuran (THF) gives rise to neutral [(&#951;4&#8208;CNT)Ln(thf)2(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce) and ionic [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;COT)][CNT] (x=4 (Ce, Nd, Tb), 3 (Er)) species in a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.

&lt;p&gt;The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)Ln(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)][(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.

Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single-molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self-sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity in the Zirconium Acid Triphosphate ZrH5(PO4)3
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a new crystalline acid Zr triphosphate which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in anhydrous conditions (relative humiditiy, RH, &#8810;1&#8201;%). This value of anhydrous proton conductivity is unprecedented and could unlock applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.







Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state proton conductors with high proton conductivity at low temperatures is crucial for the implementation of hydrogen&#8208;based technologies for portable and automotive applications. Here, we report on the discovery of a new crystalline metal acid triphosphate, ZrH5(PO4)3 (ZP3), which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5&#8211;3.1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous conditions. This is the highest anhydrous proton conductivity ever reported in a crystalline solid proton conductor in the range 25&#8211;110&#8201;&#176;C. Superprotonic conductivity in ZP3 is enabled by extended defective frustrated hydrogen bond chains, where the protons are dynamically disordered over two oxygen centers. The high proton conductivity and stability in anhydrous conditions make ZP3 an excellent candidate for innovative applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene D9H with D2 symmetry has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;=18&#8201;%) in the near&#8208;infrared region and notable dissymmetry factor (gCD=0.019) in the visible region.







Abstract
Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100&#8197;nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18&#8201;%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction was discovered using a graph&#8208;based genetic algorithm. The catalytic activity was experimentally verified by a kinetic study and the newly discovered catalyst outcompetes a widely used catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from randomly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of the peripheral membrane protein KRAS4b promotes oncogenic signaling. Using nanodiscs to enable paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments, we show that KRAS4b dimers associate through distinct conformations depending on lipid composition. Both states involve the &#945;4&#8208;&#945;5 interface, however increasing phosphatidylserine concentration alters the relative protomer orientation, shifting R135 electrostatic interactions from D153 to E168.







Abstract
KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in &#8776;30&#8201;% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the &#8220;&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5&#8221; interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4&#8201;and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFU&#8208;4 shows high selectivity for adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 owing to a large activation energy for C2H2 diffusion through narrow pore apertures. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange increases the pore aperture size, allowing MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F to adsorb a large quantity of C2H2 and exhibit reversed selectivity for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
Although many porous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta=benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98&#8201;%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8722;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98&#8201;% purity) to be harvested from C2H2/CO2 mixtures by room temperature desorption.

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of structurally well&#8208;defined bimetallic complexes (FeFe, NiFe, NiNi, ZnFe, NiZn) was used as a molecular platform to understand Ni/Fe cooperative water oxidation mechanism. The results disclosed that O&#8722;O bond formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety in NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O species, which provides a helpful guidance for rational design of heterobimetallic catalysts.







Abstract
We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8722;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8722;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the Catellani reactions has enabled the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls starting from aryl iodides and bromides. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation (32 examples and 6 subsequent derivatizations), a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halide complexes.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8722;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8722;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.

A new molecular design strategy has been proposed to construct the deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF molecules by the integration of asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N and symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units to form a rigid and extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton. The resultant ODBN exhibited deep&#8208;blue emission, high PLQY of 93&#8201;% and small FWHM of 26&#8197;nm. High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLED employing ODBN as emitter was achieved with maximum EQE value of 24.15&#8201;% and the CIE y coordinate below 0.1.







Abstract
Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8722;B&#8722;N) multi&#8208;resonance (MR) unit into traditional N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8722;B&#8722;N, symmetric N&#8722;B&#8722;N and extended O&#8722;B&#8722;N&#8722;B&#8722;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.

The proof-of-concept emitter &lt;b&gt;ODBN&lt;/b&gt; exhibited respectable deep-blue emission with Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high photoluminescence quantum yield of 93&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26&#8197;nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing &lt;b&gt;ODBN&lt;/b&gt; as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15&#8201;% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient protocol for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of arenes via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this strategy further leads to a regiodivergent reductive deuteration that enables precise control of the deuteration sites as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.

         <title>Lithium Aluminium Hydride and Metallic Iron: A Powerful Team in Alkene and Arene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium aluminium hydride is well&#8208;known as a stoichiometric reducing agent for ketones. In combination with finely divided Fe0 it is a powerful catalyst for hydrogenation of challenging alkenes or even arenes. The actual catalyst is a thermal decomposition product of LiAlH4 and Fe0. The preactivated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst is also active under mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Alkenes that normally do not react with LiAlH4 (3&#8208;hexene, cyclohexene, 1&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexene), can be reduced to the corresponding alkanes by a mixture of LiAlH4 and Fe0 (the iron was activated by Metal&#8208;Vapour&#8208;Synthesis). This alkene&#8208;to&#8208;alkane conversion with a stoichiometric quantity of LiAlH4/Fe0 does not need quenching with water or acids, implying that both H's originate from LiAlH4. The LiAlH4/Fe0 combination is also a remarkably potent cooperative catalyst for hydrogenation of multi&#8208;substituted alkenes and benzene or toluene. An induction period of circa two hours and the minimally required temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, suggests that the actual catalyst is a combination of Fe0 and the decomposition product of LiAlH4 (LiH and Al0). A thermally pre&#8208;activated LiAlH4/Fe0 catalyst did not need an induction time and is also active at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar H2. A combination of AliBu3 and Fe0 is an even more active hydrogenation catalyst. Without pre&#8208;activation, tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes like Me2C=CMe2 and toluene could be fully hydrogenated.

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds&#8208;to&#8208;minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&#8722;1) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&#8722;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;5&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.

         <title>In situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy for the controllable heterogeneous supramolecular polymerization of liquid crystalline block copolymers. This strategy was demonstrated to be highly efficient and robust, and amphiphilic triblock copolymer&#8208;like supramolecular polymers were directly fabricated, which could spontaneously undergo high&#8208;level assembly to form hierarchical structures in a controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.

         <title>N&#8208;(Morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide: A Shelf&#8208;Stable, Bilateral Platform Molecule Enabling Access to Diverse Unsymmetrical Disulfides

A shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare disulfurating reagent with chemoselectively displaceable amino and imide leaving groups is described. Protonation of this reagent promotes exclusive displacement of the amino group with various neutral carbon nucleophiles. The resulting dithiophthalimides are amenable to diverse substitution reactions under basic or neutral conditions, thus enabling expedient access to structurally diverse unsymmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
Synthetic methods for unsymmetrical disulfides are greatly needed owing to their applications in drug discovery, linker chemistry, and materials sciences. In this study, a new shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare bilateral disulfurating platform molecule, N&#8208;(morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides. The amino and imide leaving groups of this reagent can be orthogonally transformed. Under acidic conditions, the amino moiety undergoes selective protonation and thus can be displaced by various carbon nucleophiles, such as allyl trimethylsilanes, alkynyl silanes, and electron&#8208;rich arenes, leaving the phthalimide moiety untouched. Meanwhile, the phthalimide leaving group is amenable to substitution under basic or neutral conditions. The combination of these transformations provides rapid access to diverse unsymmetrical disulfides through two C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>

Atomically dispersed Zn&#8722;N4 sites mediate transfer of electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to dissolved oxygen (DO). Self&#8208;oxidation of pollutants is realized along with PMS oxidation into singlet oxygen (1O2) and DO reduction into superoxide radicals (O2.&#8722;) for catalytic oxidation of contaminants. Resource consumption and residual sulfate anion (SO42&#8722;) formation are reduced.







Abstract
Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC) for Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming an atomic Zn&#8722;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8722;Zn&#8722;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation, including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8722;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donated by electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#8901;&#8722; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Free&#8208;Standing 2D Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Polyimine Membrane for Selective Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of flexible dibenzo&#8208;14&#8208;crown&#8208;4&#8208;ether moieties into a rigid framework has led to the generation of a bioinspired ultrathin membrane that allows proton transport. The interconnected hydrogen&#8208;bond/water networks and ideal binding sites result in the highly selective and fast transportation of protons through the membrane.







Abstract
Biological proton channels play important roles in the delicate metabolism process, and have led to great interest in mimicking selective proton transport. Herein, we designed a bioinspired proton transport membrane by incorporating flexible 14&#8208;crown&#8208;4 (14C4) units into rigid frameworks of polyimine films by an interfacial Schiff base reaction. The Young's modulus of the membrane reaches about 8.2&#8197;GPa. The 14C4 units could grab water, thereby forming hydrogen bond&#8208;water networks and acting as jumping sites to lower the energy barrier of proton transport. The molecular chains present a vertical orientation to the membrane, and the ions travel between the quasi&#8208;planar molecular sheets. Furthermore, the 14C4 moieties could bond alkali ions through host&#8211;guest interactions. Thus, the ion conductance follows H+&#8811;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+, and an ultrahigh selectivity of H+/Li+ (ca. 215) is obtained. This study provides an effective avenue for developing ion&#8208;selective membranes by embedding macrocycle motifs with inherent cavities.

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for alcohol deoxygenation that functions across a wide range of alcohol structures is reported. This approach combines the reductive potency of carbon dioxide radical anion with acidic additives to promote the kinetically slow C(sp3)&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8722;O bond fragmentation step.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorogen called CPVCM can undergo a specific amination with primary amines and photoarrangement under UV irradiation. Its applications in developing multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors and an all&#8208;round information encryption system are based on its properties of multiple controls and responses.







Abstract
Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.

Herein, we reported an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple-colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all-round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outer&#8208;Shell Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Catalysts for the Synthesis of Polyolefin Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general heterogenization route was employed to prepare outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supported &#945;&#8208;diimine Ni catalysts. These heterogeneous catalysts demonstrate high activity, stable catalytic performances towards different fillers, and good morphology control in the synthesis of polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties.







Abstract
In situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.

         <title>Regulating the Synergistic Effect in Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts by Adjusting the Coupling Strength Between Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, different metal center spacing or different conjugation degree of bridge skeleton were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers for OER.







Abstract
Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect is still limited since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on OER performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs, CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8208;performance relationships, which is important for the rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer chiral 2D network structures with photoswitchable internal cavities have been formed by the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;based tetrapod aromatic amphiphiles, with spontaneous chirality induction arising from the breaking of both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The chiral network structures can selectively catch one enantiomer from a racemic solution and then release it upon UV irradiation through reversible pore deformation.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of their unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in the in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both the plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining the 2D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release it upon UV irradiation.

         <title>Managing Secondary Phase Lead Iodide in Hybrid Perovskites via Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Robust Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;reconstruction strategy that converts the excess unstable PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer on the surface of perovskite films by employing the rationally selected mediator ((C2H5O)3Si(CH2)3NH3)2SO4 in toluene, has been used to stabilize the soft perovskite lattice for synchronously boosting the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Rationally managing the secondary&#8208;phase excess lead iodide (PbI2) in hybrid perovskite is of significance for pursuing high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the challenge remains on its conversion to a homogeneous layer that is robust stable against environmental stimuli. We herein demonstrate an effective strategy of surface reconstruction that converts the excess PbI2 into a gradient lead sulfate&#8208;silica bi&#8208;layer, which substantially stabilizes the perovskite film and reduces interfacial charge transfer barrier in the PSCs device. The perovskite films with such bi&#8208;layer could bear harsh conditions such as soaking in water, light illumination at 70&#8201;% relative humidity, and the damp&#8208;thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% humidity) environment. The resulted PSCs deliver a champion efficiency up to 24.09&#8201;%, as well as remarkable environmental stability, e.g., retaining 78&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 5500&#8197;h of shelf storage, and 82&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h of operational stability testing.

We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;palladium/hydrogen shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group, which provides a divergent access to substituted 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans and indolines. Further studies unveiled a novel relayed decarbonylative Catellani&#8208;type reaction. Mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations have shed light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a PdIV intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4-palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5-Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5-Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5-membered-dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5-palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5-palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a Pd&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;In nanoalloy supported on Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 is a highly efficient catalyst for electroassisted propane dehydrogenation. Surface doping of Sm3+ enriched the surface proton density on TiO2 by charge compensation, which boosted propane dehydrogenation by accelerating proton collision on propane due to enhanced surface protonics. A propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was achieved at 300&#8201;&#176;C, which is far beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation.







Abstract
Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8722;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1&#8197;mol&#8201;% to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3&#8201;% was obtained at 300&#8201;&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5&#8201;%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized PEG adsorption interphases realize highly reversible Zn/Li anodes. The organic/inorganic SEI layer induced by the adsorbed PEG interphases plays a key role in the stability of the metal anode and the low N/P ratio full cells.







Abstract
Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400&#8197;Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available point chirality units have been embedded adjacent to dicyanostilbene moieties in monomers to effect cooperative supramolecular polymerization. This effective and economic approach based on the synergistic participation of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, which facilitate remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core, allows photodetection based on circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Circularly polarized photodetectors require chiral light absorption materials with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection capability with a dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to those of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90&#8201;% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerization provides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.

         <title>Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING potentiates immunotherapy agents. Using a luminescence&#8208;based cellular assay, we discovered a novel protein&#8208;protein interaction modulator, SB24011, that inhibited the STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction and upregulated cellular STING levels. As a result, SB24011 boosted STING immunity and improved the in vivo efficacy of immunotherapy with a STING agonist and an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody.







Abstract
Modulating target proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system has recently expanded the scope of pharmacological inventions. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an auspicious target for immunotherapy. Seminal studies envisioned the importance of STING as well as the utility of its agonists in immunotherapy outcomes. Herein, we suggest UPPRIS (upregulation of target proteins by protein&#8208;protein interaction strategy) to pharmacologically increase cellular STING levels for improved immunotherapy. We discovered the small molecule SB24011 that inhibits STING&#8208;TRIM29 E3 ligase interaction, thus blocking TRIM29&#8208;induced degradation of STING. SB24011 enhanced STING immunity by upregulating STING protein levels, which robustly potentiated the immunotherapy efficacy of STING agonist and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody via systemic anticancer immunity. Overall, we demonstrated that targeted protein upregulation of STING can be a promising approach for immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Discovery of Potent Broad&#8208;Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur&#8208;Au coordination chemistry guided well&#8208;ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi&#8208;toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti&#8208;tumor vaccine responses.







Abstract
Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long&#8208;lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer&#8208;aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad&#8208;spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR)&#8208;targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor&#8208;specific antigens to immunize mice against B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and 4T1&#8208;PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer&#8208;aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.

     alt="Computer-Aided Discovery of Potent Broad-Spectrum Vaccine Adjuvants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Au nanoparticle (AuNP) adjuvants are prepared through computer-aided molecule design and machine learning to discover agonist ligands, and sulfur-Au coordination chemistry guided well-ordered presentation of ligands on AuNP surface. These AuNP adjuvants show advantages in multi-toll like receptor (TLR) targeting and application as broad-spectrum adjuvants to boost robust multifaceted anti-tumor vaccine responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvants stimulate the immune system to vigorously respond to a vaccine. While current adjuvants such as aluminum salts and oil-in-water emulsions have been used for decades, they do not generate broad and long-lasting responses in many vaccines. Consequently, more potent adjuvants are needed. Here, using computer-aided molecule design and machine learning, we discovered 2 new, broad-spectrum adjuvants that can boost vaccine responses. Our library containing 46 toll-like receptor (TLR)-targeting agonist ligands were assembled on Au nanoparticles. Comprehensive &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed both leads promoted dendritic cell activation via multiple TLRs and enhanced antigen presentation to T cells. When used together with tumor-specific antigens to immunize mice against B16-OVA melanoma and 4T1-PD1 breast cancer, both adjuvants unleashed strong immune responses that suppressed tumor growth and lung metastases. Our results show computer-aided design and screening can rapidly uncover potent adjuvants for tackling waning immunity in current vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8208;Aryl Glycosylation by Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroaryl Glycosyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones undergo desulfonylative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling with aryl&#8208;substituted nucleophiles or electrophiles through two complementary catalytic systems. The reactions offer access to a wide variety of C&#8208;aryl glycoside products with high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are increasingly gaining attention in carbohydrate chemistry because they enable glycosyl precursors, readily accessible as anomeric mixtures, to converge to a single diastereomeric product. However, controlling the stereochemical outcome through transition&#8208;metal catalysis remains challenging, and methods that leverage bench&#8208;stable heteroaryl glycosyl sulfone donors to facilitate glycosylation are rare. Herein, we show two complementary nonprecious metal catalytic systems, based on iron or nickel, which are capable of promoting efficient C&#8722;C coupling between heteroaryl glycosyl sulfones and aromatic nucleophiles or electrophiles through distinct mechanisms and modes of activation. Diverse C&#8208;aryl glycosides were secured with excellent selectivity, scope, and functional&#8208;group compatibility, and reliable access to both &#945; and &#946; isomers was possible for key sugar residues.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on Solvation Structure of Carbonate Electrolyte toward Durable Sodium Metal Battery at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte is designed by molecular engineering of solvated structure. By introducing the additive ethylene sulfate, the sodium ion diffusion barrier is lowered and strong solid electrolyte interphase is formed, inhibiting sodium dendrite growth. The as&#8208;fabricated cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;cycle performance at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Carbonate electrolytes have excellent chemical stability and high salt solubility, which are ideally practical choice for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium (Na) metal battery at room temperature. However, their application at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) is adversely affected by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed by electrolyte decomposition and the difficulty of desolvation. Here, we designed a novel low&#8208;temperature carbonate electrolyte by molecular engineering on solvation structure. The calculations and experimental results demonstrate that ethylene sulfate (ES) reduces the sodium ion desolvation energy and promotes the forming of more inorganic substances on the Na surface, which promote ion migration and inhibit dendrite growth. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the Na||Na symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle of 1500&#8197;hours, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) battery achieves 88.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Reversible Zn Metal Anodes Enabled by Trace Amounts of Underpotential Deposition Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M is a metal with a higher reduction potential and work function than Zn. If Mn+ is used as an electrolyte additive, Mn+ will deposit preferentially and then render UPD of Zn uniformly on M. Moreover, the deposited M can dissolve back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping and thus does not increase the interfacial charge transfer resistance, enabling a highly reversible Zn anode. Ni2+, Cr2+, and Co2+ have been verified to function as Mn+.







Abstract
Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Guided Nickel&#8208;Indium Heterogeneous Alloy Electrocatalysts for Promoting the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch guides the selective alloying of tetragonal In to fcc Ni rather than hcp Ni. The heterogeneous alloy with 5&#8197;at% In catalyzes the electrochemical production of 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with 9.15&#8197;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency at 400&#8197;mV vs. RHE in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
The immiscibility of crystallographic facets in multi&#8208;metallic catalysts plays a key role in driving the green H2 production by water electrolysis. The lattice mismatch between tetragonal In and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ni is 14.9&#8201;% but the mismatch with hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Ni is 49.8&#8201;%. Hence, in a series of Ni&#8722;In heterogeneous alloys, In is selectively incorporated in the fcc Ni. The 18&#8211;20&#8197;nm Ni particles have 36&#8197;wt&#8201;% fcc phase, which increases to 86&#8201;% after In incorporation. The charge transfer from In to Ni, stabilizes the Ni0 state and In develops a fractional positive charge that favors *OH adsorption. With only 5&#8197;at% In, 153&#8197;mL&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 is evolved at &#8722;385&#8197;mV with mass activity of 57.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at&#8212;400&#8197;mV, 200&#8197;h stability at &#8722;0.18&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Pt&#8208;like activity at high current densities, due to the spontaneous water dissociation, lower activation energy barrier, optimal adsorption energy of OH&#8722; ions and the prevention of catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Origin of the Activity Trend in the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethanol over VOx/CeO2
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using operando time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped activity trend in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol over VOx/CeO2 catalysts as a function of VOx surface coverage. Vanadium and cerium synergistically change their oxidation states during the catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity correlates with the concentration of reversible Ce4+/3+ species.







Abstract
Supported vanadia (VOx) is a versatile catalyst for various redox processes where ceria&#8208;supported VOx have shown to be particularly active in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols. In this work, we clarify the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped ethanol ODH activity trend for VOx/CeOx catalysts using operando quick V K&#8208; and Ce L3&#8208; edge XAS experiments performed under transient conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate that both vanadium and cerium are synergistically involved in alcohol ODH. The concentration of reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ species was identified as the main descriptor of the alcohol ODH activity. The activity drop in the volcano plot, observed at above ca. 3&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;2 surface loading (ca. 30&#8201;% of VOx monolayer coverage), is related to the formation of spectator V4+ and Ce3+ species, which were identified here for the first time. These results might prove to be helpful for the rational optimization of VOx/CeO2 catalysts and the refinement of the theoretical models.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8208;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>

We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides by Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), providing facile access to chiral &#945;&#8208;tertiary azides and 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with newly developed PYBOX ligands with a C4 sulfonyl group. The key role of the C4 sulfonyl in tuning the electronic and steric properties of the chiral catalysts to enhance enantiomer discrimination is rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8208;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, bearing a C4 sulfonyl group, enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone, and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles with high to excellent ee values. DFT calculations and control experiments reveal that the C4 sulfonyl group decreases the Lewis basicity of the ligand and increases the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and functions as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome&#8197;c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>

Photoresponsive Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c)&#8208;sensing probes consisting of fluorescent caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer frameworks or redox&#8208;active caged Cyt.&#8201;c&#8208;aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanoelectrodes are introduced. Light&#8208;activated, spatially confined, optical or electrochemical detection of Cyt.&#8201;c, in cellular subdomains, at the single cell level is demonstrated. The analytical tools are applied to monitor intracellular Cyt.&#8201;c translocation upon cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt.&#8201;c) is a key initiator of the caspases that activate cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments and the detection of Cyt.&#8201;c delivery between cellular compartments upon apoptosis is important for probing cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments at the single cell level. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester&#8208;caged Cyt.&#8201;c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell compartments, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt.&#8201;c through the formation of Cyt.&#8201;c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic conditions. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt.&#8201;c in cellular compartments of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional polymer passivation network was constructed by combining the bulk in situ polymerization and surface pre&#8208;polymerization/secondary polymerization strategies. The all&#8208;rounded passivation structure increased carrier diffusion length, promoted energy level alignment and carrier injection. Corresponding devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V with an efficiency over 24&#8201;%, and module also achieves an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
The spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24&#8201;% (the certified efficiency is 24.16&#8201;%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and efficient Sn2+ vacancy tuning strategy is proposed to achieve strongly localized excitons in two&#8208;dimensional (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets by separating corner&#8208;sharing [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thereby promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported thus far for tin iodide perovskites.







Abstract
Exciton localization is an approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.

         <title>Development of a Versatile Protein Labeling Tool for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging Using Fluorescent &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protein labeling system was developed using non&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactam &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. Fluorophore&#8208;diazabicyclooctane prodrug conjugates efficiently and stably labeled &#946;&#8208;lactamase tag&#8208;fused proteins localized in various intracellular compartments in living cells. Furthermore, use of a pH&#8208;activatable fluorophore allowed visualization of lysosomal protein trafficking at the late stage of autophagy under cellular starvation.







Abstract
To understand the function of protein in live cells, real&#8208;time monitoring of protein dynamics and sensing of their surrounding environment are important methods. Fluorescent labeling tools are thus needed that possess fast labeling kinetics, high efficiency, and long&#8208;term stability. We developed a versatile chemical protein&#8208;labeling tool based on fluorophore&#8208;conjugated diazabicyclooctane &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) and wild&#8208;type TEM&#8208;1 &#946;&#8208;lactamase protein tag. The fluorescent probes efficiently formed a stable carbamoylated complex with &#946;&#8208;lactamase, and the labeled proteins were visualized over a long period of time in live cells. Moreover, use of an &#945;&#8208;fluorinated carboxylate ester&#8208;based BLI prodrug enabled the probe to permeate cell membranes and stably label intracellular proteins after unexpected spontaneous ester hydrolysis. Lastly, combining the labeling tool with a pH&#8208;activatable fluorescent probe allowed visual monitoring of lysosomal protein translocation during autophagy.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a rational catalyst design process by integrating theoretical prediction and experimental realization. Asymmetrically coordinated iridium single atoms IrN3O embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks are unambiguously revealed for the optimum formic acid electro&#8208;oxidation catalysis, which reaches a peak current of 20.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1, 167&#8197;times superior to that of the Ir/C nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8722;xOx (x=1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunable Transition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of cation exchange with different crystal structures is limited. We propose a new descriptor, the parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), to synthesize transition metal sulfides with crystal structure selectivity by gas&#8208;phase cation exchange&#8208;induced topological transformation. Powered by precise synthetic control, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance is improved by 36.2 times after band gap engineering.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the band gap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.

         <title>Insights into the Role of Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photobase in Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in (sp3)C&#8722;H Oxygenation of Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones is enabled by mpg&#8208;CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) is a transition metal free semiconductor that mediates a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Although photoinduced electron transfer is often postulated in the mechanism, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a more favorable pathway for substrates possessing X&#8722;H bonds. Upon excitation of an (sp2)N&#8208;rich structure of g&#8208;CN with visible light, it behaves as a photobase&#8212;it undergoes reductive quenching accompanied by abstraction of a proton from a substrate. The results of modeling allowed us to identify active sites for PCET&#8212;the &#8216;triangular pockets&#8217; on the edge facets of g&#8208;CN. We employ excited state PCET from the substrate to g&#8208;CN to selectively cleavethe endo&#8208;(sp3)C&#8722;H bond in oxazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;ones followed by trapping the radical with O2. This reaction affords 1,3&#8208;oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones. Measurement of the apparent pKa value and modeling suggest that g&#8208;CN excited state can cleave X&#8722;H bonds that are characterized by bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) &#8776;100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Transformation of oxazolidinones to corresponding oxazolidine-2,4-diones is enabled by mpg-CN, a carbon nitride photocatalyst, using oxygen gas as an oxidant. The reaction proceeds via proton-coupled electron transfer. The mechanism of this transformation is established by photocatalytic experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond was proposed for the fast synthesis of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs), achieving the construction of a HCOFs library with diverse nanostructures. The synthesized HCOFs with abundant cavities are ideal nanocarriers for high&#8208;efficiency drug loading, thus enhancing the sonodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.

Enantiopure (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) [6]helicene with a seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene have been simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with opposite helicity from optically pure doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors.

Abstract
Enantiopure [6]helicene containing an embedded seven&#8208;membered ring and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99&#8201;%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereocontrolled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with opposite helicity.

         <title>Unlocking a (Pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl&#8208;pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo&#8208;metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of Fe3+ spin states from high spin (HS; s=5/2) in bulk crystals to mixed spin lattices (with s=5/2 and low spin (LS); s=1/2) is demonstrated in a two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layer catalyst by mechanical exfoliation. The resulting catalyst has enhanced activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction (CO2RR) over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve activity and/or selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate room&#8208;temperature spin state of catalytic centers. Herein, we report a mechanical exfoliation strategy to in situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s=5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s=1/2) of the ferric center. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50&#8201;% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO2 adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that low-spin 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and reducing activation barrier. Hence, the spin manipulation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition of Hybrid Copper Halides with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent material has been developed that not only exhibits reversible photoluminescence conversion and nonlinear optical switching in response to thermal stimulus, but also displays peculiar crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition induced domino&#8208;type single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition and mechanical force induced phase transition under concomitant emission&#8208;color change.







Abstract
Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+=CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity / Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridazine core structure with antiaromatic character has been utilized to synthesize a double aza[7]helicene with rarely accessible chiroptical properties in the red region as well as redox&#8208;active behaviour. This chiral polyaromatic hydrocarbon system shows oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent aromaticity/antiaromaticity switching via oxidation&#8208;induced cation species.







Abstract
We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension through angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8901;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to lead to the development of further redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel pyridinyl PtIV complexes obtained by ligand exchange reactions could quickly be reduced to the PtII parent drugs. The axial pyridines acted as leaving group ligands and were utilized for designing multitargeted anticancer prodrugs. These multitargeted pyridinyl PtIV complexes were effective in killing Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth.







Abstract
Although multitargeted PtIV anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of PtIV complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted PtIV prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing PtIV prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a PtIV center.

         <title>Methane Photooxidation with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity Towards Oxygenates: Proton Rebound Ensures the Regeneration of Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane dehydrogenation over boron nitride nanosheets proceeds via N&#8722;H surface bonds, which function as a hydrogen bonding trap to impede cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds and hinder continuous dehydrogenation. Electrons from the BN surface are injected into the antibonding orbitals of N&#8722;H bonds; thereby, the overoxidation of products into thermodynamically favored CO2 is significantly suppressed.







Abstract
Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of a hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate the methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time it is found that the designed N&#8722;H bonds can work as a hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from this property, the N&#8722;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8722;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleave, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5&#8201;%) and nearly 100&#8201;% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.

By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.







Abstract
Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands with multiple coordination sites and solute guests results in flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks featuring guest&#8208;responsive behavior. This leads to a significant transformation in their coordination networks and hence properties, for example, controllable cargo release, and expands the rational design of flexible metal&#8208;organic materials.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8208;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8208;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8208;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8208;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for various applications.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Nitrooxylation: Noncyclic Hypervalent Iodine Nitrooxylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagent is prepared from aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. This reagent facilitates the zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers with broad scope, and also can be used in the nitrooxylation of various enolizable C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Organic nitrates are broadly applied as pharmaceuticals (acting as efficient nitric oxide donor), energetic materials, building blocks in organic synthesis, etc. However, practical and direct methods to access organic nitrates efficiently are still rare, mainly due to the lack of powerful nitrooxylating reagents. Herein, we report bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagents, oxybis(aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanediyl) dinitrates (OAIDNs, 2), which are prepared just by using aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. The reagents are used to achieve a mild and operationally simple protocol to access diverse organic nitrates. By employing of 2, zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers is realized efficiently to access the corresponding &#946;&#8208;nitrooxy ketones with high functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, a series of direct and catalyst&#8208;free nitrooxylations of enolizable C&#8722;H bonds are carried out smoothly to afford the desired organic nitrates within minutes by just mixing the substrates with 2 in dichloromethane.

This work presents a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen&#8208;based free&#8208;standing POP films at room temperature. These POP films show bright luminescence with high PLQY up to 37.8&#8201;% and can encapsulate organic dyes to form efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting thin films.







Abstract
We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be efficiently achieved under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer by micromolar concentrations of iron. The desulfurization mechanism likely involves iron(III) species produced through the oxidation of iron(II)&#8208;carbonate complexes by molecular oxygen and is reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters.







Abstract
One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.

         <title>A Quenched Size&#8208;Expanded Nucleotide Reports Activity of the Leukemia Biomarker Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic probe based on size&#8208;expanded adenosine is used to monitor activity of the leukemia biomarker and therapeutic target Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). The probe can measure TdT activity in cancer cell extract in real&#8208;time and report on its response to treatment. Use of the probe in a high&#8208;throughput screening led to the identification of the non&#8208;nucleoside inhibitor SCH202676.







Abstract
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) is a template&#8208;independent DNA polymerase that plays an essential role in the human adaptive immune system and is upregulated in several types of leukemia. It has therefore gained interest as a leukemia biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Herein, we describe a FRET&#8208;quenched fluorogenic probe based on a size&#8208;expanded deoxyadenosine that reports directly on TdT enzymatic activity. The probe enables real&#8208;time detection of primer extension and de novo synthesis activity of TdT and displays selectivity over other polymerase and phosphatase enzymes. Importantly, TdT activity and its response to treatment with a promiscuous polymerase inhibitor could be monitored in human T&#8208;lymphocyte cell extract and Jurkat cells using a simple fluorescence assay. Finally, employing the probe in a high&#8208;throughput assay resulted in the identification of a non&#8208;nucleoside TdT inhibitor.

         <title>Post&#8208;Nickelation of a Crystalline Trinuclear Copper Organic Framework for Synergistic Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic framework was fabricated by post&#8208;modification of the copper&#8208;containing organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu) with divalent nickel ions. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and nickel ions resulted in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO with a high conversion rate and selectivity.







Abstract
Rational regulation of electronic structures and functionalities of framework materials still remains challenging. Herein, reaction of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tribenzhydrazide with tris(&#956;2&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N,N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper (Cu3Py3) generates the crystalline copper organic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu). Post&#8208;modification with divalent nickel ions affords the heterometallic framework USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni). Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical simulations reveal their two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal structure geometry. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques disclose the mixed CuI/CuII state nature of Cu3Py3 in USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with a uniform bistable Cu34+(CuI2CuII)&#8201;:&#8201;Cu35+(CuICuII2) (ca. 1&#8201;:&#8201;3) oxidation state, resulting in a significantly improved formation efficiency of the charge&#8208;separation state. This endows the Ni sites with enhanced activity and USTB&#8208;11(Cu,Ni) with outstanding photocatalytic CO2 to CO performance with a conversion rate of 22&#8201;130&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide: Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;destructive in situ EPR technique is developed to directly observe the electronic signal conversion process of radical anions and dianions upon charge/discharge cycling, verifying the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reaction of polyimide electrodes in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.

         <title>Back Cover: Targeted Protein Upregulation of STING for Boosting the Efficacy of Immunotherapy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein upregulation by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the strategy opposite to targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article (e202300978), Dong&#8208;Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING&#8208;TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune&#8208;oncology treatment by changing cold to hot tumors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Targeted protein upregulation&lt;/b&gt; by modulating the interaction between a target protein and its E3 ligase is the strategy opposite to targeted protein degradation (PROTAC). In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202300978"&gt;(e202300978)&lt;/a&gt;, Dong-Sup Lee, Seung&#8197;Bum Park enhanced the cellular STING levels by inhibiting STING-TRIM29 interaction, which activates innate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and potentiates the immune-oncology treatment by changing cold to hot tumors. Thus, targeted protein upregulation can be an alternative drug discovery strategy for undruggable targets.

Cell&#8208;selective regulation of protein translocation is achieved through the rational design of an endogenous enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids platform. The system enables enzyme&#8208;activated capture of proteins of interest and thus regulation of their cytoplasmic&#8208;nuclear shuttling with tumor&#8208;cell specificity, as reported by Mengyuan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214958).

Reversible posttranslational fluorescence labeling opens exciting possibilities for advanced and superresolution microscopy techniques. In their Research Article (e202219050) Michael Holtmannsp&#246;tter, Jacob Piehler et&#8197;al. have engineered HaloTag variants with restored dehalogenase activity, which enzymatically exchange fluorogenic substrates at the second&#8208;to&#8208;minutes time scale. Thus, long&#8208;term time&#8208;lapse imaging with utmost spatial and temporal resolution is achieved with particularly striking performance in single molecule tracking and localization microscopy.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most abundant motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, chemists were constrained in their ability to append substituents at the meta&#8208;position of pyridines. Two complementary one&#8208;pot approaches developed independently have helped to overcome this challenge. While one involves breaking the pyridine ring to form linear imines, the other relies on 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions to disrupt the aromaticity of pyridine.







Abstract
The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine is a prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of valuable chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers, and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.

Reconfigurable DNA frameworks provide a plethora of functional materials for constructing DNA nanostructures, operating switchable reactions, controlling optical phenomena, driving dynamic networks and designing materials with switchable properties.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provides a means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present Review addresses recent advances in the construction and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks is addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.

Merging metal and enzyme catalysis provides multiple solutions for the synthesis of optically active molecules. To achieve this aim, both catalyst types need to work under similar reaction conditions avoiding mutual inactivation. Herein, successful one&#8208;pot sequential and concurrent cascades are described for the design of high&#8208;yielding transformations with excellent levels of (stereo)selectivity.







Abstract
The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8722;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.

Peptides have many potential applications as building blocks in materials science and biomedicine since they organise into supramolecular structures. Advances in computational chemistry enable the mapping, searching and systematic evaluation of large sequence spaces to select viable candidates. Integration of computation and experiment provides understanding of specific interactions, enabling engineering of more versatile functional materials.







Abstract
Interest in peptide&#8208;based supramolecular materials has grown extensively since the 1980s and the application of computational methods has paralleled this. These methods contribute to the understanding of experimental observations based on interactions and inform the design of new supramolecular systems. They are also used to virtually screen and navigate these very large design spaces. Increasingly, the use of artificial intelligence is employed to screen far more candidates than traditional methods. Based on a brief history of computational and experimentally integrated investigations of peptide structures, we explore recent impactful examples of computationally driven investigation into peptide self&#8208;assembly, focusing on recent advances in methodology development. It is clear that the integration between experiment and computation to understand and design new systems is becoming near seamless in this growing field.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Emerging Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear optics (NLO) is a field of immense importance owing to its usefulness in lasing, bio&#8208;imaging, etc. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a potential class of NLO materials. This Minireview presents an overview of the principles of NLO, a discussion on various aspects of designing COFs for NLO, and a summary of important real&#8208;life applications of COFs based on their NLO response.







Abstract
The vastness of organic synthetic strategies and knowledge of reticular chemistry have made covalent organic frameworks (COFs) one of the most chemically and structurally diverse class of materials with potential applications ranging from gas storage, molecular separation, and catalysis to energy storage and magnetism. Recently, this class of porous materials has garnered increasing interest as potential nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Traditionally, inorganic crystals, small&#8208;molecule organic chromophores, and oligomers have been studied for their NLO response. Nevertheless, COFs offer significant advantages over existing NLO materials in terms of higher mechanical strength, thermochemical stability, and extended conjugation. Herein, we discuss crucial aspects, terminology, and measurement techniques related to NLO, followed by a critical analysis of the design principles for COFs with NLO response. Furthermore, we touch on selected potential applications of these NLO materials. Finally, future prospects and challenges of COFs as NLO materials are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery was developed by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. The hybrid battery displays excellent electrochemical performances with wide voltage window, high capacity and good cyclic stability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8197;V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of versatile &#945;&#8208;quaternary acyclic ketones, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and aldehydes, by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles. Transformations employ simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a chiral phosphine, and generate a broad range of products bearing difficult to access dialkyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and 90&#8201;:&#8201;10 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>

Biodegradation of water&#8208;soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;Biodegradation of water-soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ-independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical-chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ-independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of two FeIII complexes is reported. The change in spin state is reversible, recorded over several cycles with Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Appending a diethylamino group to the ligand of one of the complexes allows for a colorimetric response from blue&#8208;black to bright pink upon protonation.







Abstract
Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2, also yield a colorimetric response.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings
</title>

         <dc:description>
Expanded helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings can be synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;coupling&#8208;mediated oligomerization followed by bismuth(III)&#8208;triflate&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their chiroptical properties were also studied.







Abstract
Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8211;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8211;0.024 for H4).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Trifluoromethoxylation of Propargyl Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, great challenges still remain for direct asymmetric trifluoromethoxylation with only two successful reports since the first discovery. Here, by subtly tuning the leaving group, protecting group, ligand structure, reaction temperature, solvent and base, we finally realized a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates for the first time.







Abstract
Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types. Here, we describe the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective trifluoromethoxylation of propargyl sulfonates using trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS) as the trifluoromethoxy source in up to 96&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8208;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective synthesis of AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers has been rarely reported. Here, ethylene oxide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst owing to a Janus effects of Lewis acid on the activity of the two monomers.







Abstract
One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of an Octagermacubane with Two Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanium(0) Atoms and its Unique Radical Anion</title>

A facile synthesis of an octagermacubane, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms, by the thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(silyl)germane and bis(silyl)germane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, is reported. Reduction of the octagermacubane with tBuMe2SiNa yields the first X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of a Ge&#8208;centered octagermacubane radical anion.







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 9 and bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylmethylsilyl)germane 17 at 100&#8201;&#176;C produces unexpectedly octagermacubane 18, having two 3&#8208;coordinate Ge0 atoms (40&#8201;% yield). 18 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and it is a singlet biradical (according to DFT quantum mechanical calculations and the absence of an EPR signal). Reactions of 18 with CH2Cl2 and H2O yield the novel dichloro&#8208;octagermacubane 24 and hydroxy&#8208;octagermacubane 25, respectively. Reduction of 18 with tBuMe2SiNa in THF produces an isolable octagermacubane radical anion 26&#8208;Na. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR spectroscopy and DFT quantum mechanical calculations, 26&#8208;Na is classified as a Ge&#8208;centered radical anion.

         <title>Isolation of Structurally Heterogeneous TCR&#8208;CD3 Extracellular Vesicle Subpopulations Using Caliper Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with different T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 oligomerization states has been verified by a proposed caliper strategy. Using a caliper probe with an optimized spacing of 16&#8197;nm, the strategy successfully isolated TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric EVs (mCD3 EVs) and TCR&#8208;CD3 dimeric EVs (dCD3 EVs) from the plasma of a skin transplantation mouse model. Phenotypic analysis confirmed dCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker for acute cellular rejection.







Abstract
Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic cages are an important class of synthetic hosts, which are able to mimic the structural adaptability and allosteric regulation of naturally occurring systems. A low&#8208;symmetry FeII4L4 tetrahedral cage reported here was able to adapt its geometry from S4 to C3 or T symmetry upon guest binding; multiple binding sites allowed the host to simultaneously bind distinct guests with negative allostery.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to a low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.

         <title>Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition&#8208;Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;&#8208;bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4&#8208;positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.







Abstract
The 2&#960; electron 1,3&#8208;dipole boradigermaallyl, valence&#8208;isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.

     alt="Boradigermaallyl: (4+3) Cycloaddition-Initiated Boron Insertion into Benzene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boradigermaallyl featuring a delocalized &#960;-bond shows a boron atom insertion into benzene at room temperature. The mechanism starts by a concerted (4+3) reaction between the germanium atoms of the digermaboraallyl and the 1,4-positions of a benzene molecule. Thus, boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2&#960; electron 1,3-dipole boradigermaallyl, valence-isoelectronic to an allyl cation, is synthesized from a bis(germylene). It reacts with benzene at room temperature by insertion of a boron atom into the benzene ring. Computational investigation of the mechanism shows the boradigermaallyl reacting with a benzene molecule in a concerted (4+3) or [&#960;4s+&#960;2s] cycloaddition reaction. Thus, the boradigermaallyl acts as a highly reactive dienophile in this cycloaddition reaction with nonactivated benzene as diene unit. This type of reactivity provides a novel platform for ligand assisted borylene insertion chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed alkyne trimerization followed by oxidating coupling and fusion of zinc porphyrin units was used to construct a porphyrin nanoring around a central covalent spoke. The size and shape of these nanorings (diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm) was confirmed by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). A combination of zinc(II) and nickel(II) porphyrin units was used to increase the efficiency of the synthesis and control the positions of oxidative fusion.







Abstract
Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and offer insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative meso&#8208;meso coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7&#8197;nm).

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 18, April 24, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One obstacle to a better understanding of the &#8220;dark&#8221; lipid kinase PIP4K2C is the lack of chemical tool compounds for this protein. Here, we describe a picomolar PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, and an effective bivalent PIP4K2C degrader, TMX&#8208;4153, both of which display exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Thus, TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 represent two useful leads to further interrogate the therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.







Abstract
Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated the PIP4K2C binder into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C.
