      <title>Scalable, Durable, and Recyclable Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Conversion of CO2 to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
      <dc:description>This article communicates a series of highly active organoboron catalysts for coupling of CO2 and epoxides with merits of scalable preparation, thermostability, and recyclability. The metal&#8208;free catalysts show high reactivity towards a wide scope of cyclic carbonates (14 examples) and can withstand a high temperature up to 150 oC. Compared with most of the current metal&#8208;free catalytic systems involved using mol% catalyst loading, the catalytic capacity of our catalyst can be enhanced by three orders of magnitude (epoxide/cat. = 200,000/1, mole ratio) in the presence of cocatalyst, which greatly narrows the gap between the metal&#8208;free catalysts and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metallic systems. An intramolecular cooperative mechanism is proposed and certified on the basis of investigations on crystal structures, structure&#8208;performance relationship, kinetic studies, and key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

      <title>Sequential Solid&#8208;State Transformations Involving Consecutive Rearrangements of Secondary Building Units in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state transformations in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) systems are important phenomena and have led to the creation of new MOF structures. Solid&#8208;state transformations from interpenetrated to non&#8208;interpenetrated networks involving rearrangement of secondary building units (SBUs) in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion have not been explored to date. Herein, we report the sequential, thermally stimulated solid&#8208;state transformations in a barium&#8208;organic framework (  UPC&#8208;600  ). The two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework of&#160;  UPC&#8208;600  &#160;is converted at 373 K to  UPC&#8208;601  , a&#160;non&#8208;interpenetrated framework. This proceeds in a SCSC fashion and involves the rearrangement of two proximate rod&#8208;shaped SBUs in different nets to generate a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. At 473 K,&#160;a&#160;continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement&#160;occurred,&#160;  UPC&#8208;601  &#160;converted to  UPC&#8208;602  &#160;by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU. This is the first example of such a thermally&#8208;driven stepwise transformation involving simultaneous cleavage and regeneration of multiple bonds.&#160;This result will enable detailed studies of solid&#8208;state transformations, and encourages a deep understanding of the role of solid&#8208;state transformations in the synthesis of MOF materials.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;syringe electrokinetic protein removal from biological samples prior to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Matrix effects can compromise ionization and hence reliability of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), making sample clean&#8208;up including protein removal critical in bioanalysis. Automation of protein removal protocols is challenging. Here, an electrokinetic extraction (EkE) syringe is presented allowing for on&#8208;line electrokinetic removal of serum proteins before ESI&#8208;MS. The method relies on the electrophoretic migration of charged serum proteins away from neutral target analytes in an electric field, applied across the syringe barrel utilizing the metallic syringe needle and plunger as electrodes. Under acidic conditions, most proteins are cationic facilitating their accumulation at an cathodic plunger. Similarly, under basic conditions, the anionic proteins aggregate near the anodic plunger. Actuation of the plunger enables infusion of the deproteinated sample remaining in the barrel into the ESI&#8208;MS for detection of acidic or basic molecules. The proposed concept is demonstrated by the determination of pharmaceuticals from human serum within minutes, with sample preparation limited to a 5x dilution of the sample in the background electrolyte (BGE) and application of voltage, both of which can be performed in&#8208;syringe. Signal enhancements of 3.6&#8208;32 fold relative to direct infusion of diluted serum and up to 10.8 fold enhancement, were obtained for basic and acidic pharmaceuticals, respectively. Linear correlations for the basic drugs by EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS were achieved, covering the necessary clinical range with LOQs of 5.3, 7.8, 6.1, and 17.8 ng/mL for clomipramine, chlorphenamine, pindolol, and atenolol, respectively. For the acidic drugs analysis, EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, the LOQs were 3.1 &#181;g/mL and 2.9 &#181;g/mL for naproxen and paracetamol, respectively. The EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and EkE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS/MS methods showed good accuracy (%found of 81% to 120%), precision (&lt; 20%), and linearity (r &gt; 0.997) for all the studied drugs in spiked serum samples.</dc:description>

      <title>Single Carbon Fiber&#8208;Powered Microsensor for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing with High Neuronal Compatibility</title>
      <dc:description>Developing new principles and techniques with high neuronal compatibility for quantitatively monitoring dynamics of neurochemicals is essential for deciphering brain chemistry and function. However, this pursuit remains a great challenge. We herein report a neuron&#8208;compatible method for  in vivo  neurochemical sensing by powering single carbon fiber based on spontaneous bipolar electrochemistry as a new sensing platform.

In addition, the microsensor is also well compatible with electrophysiological recording, enabling synchronous recordings of both chemical and electrical signals.

      <title>Synthesis of 2D germanane (GeH): a new, fast and facile approach</title>
      <dc:description>Germanane (GeH), a germanium analogue of graphane, has recently attracted considerable interest because its remarkable combination of properties makes it an extremely suitable candidate as 2D material for field effect devices, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. Up to now, the synthesis of GeH has been conducted by substituting Ca by H in a  &#946;  &#8208;CaGe  2  layered Zintl phase through topochemical deintercalation in aqueous HCl. This reaction is generally slow and takes place over 6 to 14 days. The new and facile protocol presented here allows to synthesize GeH at room temperature in a significantly shorter time (a few minutes), which renders this method highly attractive for technological applications. The GeH produced with this method is highly pure and has a band gap (E  g  ) close to 1.4 eV, a lower value than that reported for germanane synthesized using HCl, which is promising for incorporation of GeH in solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>How big is the pinacol boronic ester as a substituent?</title>
      <dc:description>The synthetically versatile pinacol boronic ester group (Bpin) is generally thought of as a bulky moiety due to the two adjacent quaternary sp  3  &#8208;hydribized carbon atoms in its diol backbone. However, recent diastereoselective reactions reported in the literature have cast doubt on this perception. Herein, we report a detailed experimental and computational analysis of Bpin and structurally related boronic esters which allows us to determine three different steric parameters for the Bpin group: the A&#8208;value, ligand cone angle, and percent buried volume. All three parameters suggest that the Bpin moiety is remarkably small, with the planarity of the oxygen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen motif playing an important role in minimising steric interactions. Of the three steric parameters, percent buried volume provides the best correlation between steric size and diastereoselectivity in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthetically versatile pinacol boronic ester group (Bpin) is generally thought of as a bulky moiety due to the two adjacent quaternary sp  3  &#8208;hydribized carbon atoms in its diol backbone. However, recent diastereoselective reactions reported in the literature have cast doubt on this perception. Herein, we report a detailed experimental and computational analysis of Bpin and structurally related boronic esters which allows us to determine three different steric parameters for the Bpin group: the A&#8208;value, ligand cone angle, and percent buried volume. All three parameters suggest that the Bpin moiety is remarkably small, with the planarity of the oxygen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen motif playing an important role in minimising steric interactions. Of the three steric parameters, percent buried volume provides the best correlation between steric size and diastereoselectivity in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A De Novo Design of Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor with Planar Backbone and Near&#8208;IR Absorption for High Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have made significant progress in recent years, while the development of fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors has been unsatisfactory. Here, two fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  and m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  , were designed and synthesized. By regulating the location of the hexyloxy chains, o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  formed planar backbones, while m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  displayed a twisted backbone. Additionally, the o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  film showed a markedly red&#8208;shifted absorption after thermal annealing, which indicated the formation of J  &#8208;aggregates. For fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs), PBDB&#8208;T was used as a donor and blended with the two acceptors. The o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  &#8208;based blend films displayed high charge mobilities, lower energy loss and a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimized devices based on o  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  gave a PCE of 10.26%, which was much higher than those based on m  &#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F  at 2.63%, and it is one of the highest reported PCE values for fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors.</dc:description>

      <title>Zwitterionic peptide cloak mimics protein surfaces for protein protection</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the amino acid composition of natural protein surfaces, we developed a zwitterionic cloak containing multi&#8208;layers of short alternating glutamic acid and lysine (EK) peptides as a facile, highly effective and low&#8208;immunogenicity approach for the protection and delivery of biotherapeutics.

      <title>Interaction of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Phospholipids and the Associated Restructuring of Interfacial Lipid Water: An Interface&#8208;Selective Vibrational Spectroscopic Study</title>
      <dc:description>Interaction of a&#8208;Synuclein (aS) with biological lipid is crucial for the onset of its fibrillation at the cell membrane&#8208;water interface. Here, we probe the interaction of aS with membrane mimicking lipid monolayer&#8208;water interfaces using surface&#8208;selective heterodyne&#8208;detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD&#8208;VSFG) spectroscopy. Our results depict that aS interacts negligibly with zwitterionic lipid, but strongly affects the pristine air&#8208;water and charged lipid&#8208;water interfaces by perturbing the structure and orientation of the interfacial water. Specifically, the net negative aS (&#8208;9 in bulk water; pH 7.4) reorients the water as hydrogen&#8208;up (H&#8208;up) at the air&#8208;water interface; electrostatically interacts&#160;with positively charged lipids, making the interface nearly net neutral. Strangely, aS also interacts with negatively charged lipids: the net H&#8208;up orientation of the interfacial water decreases at anionic lipid&#8208;water interface, revealing a domain&#8208;specific (positively charged N&#8208;terminal) interaction of net negative aS with the negatively charged lipids at membrane surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cysteine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation: Biocompatible Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Bioconjugation methods using visible&#8208;light photocatalysis have emerged as powerful synthetic tools for the selective modification of biomolecules under mild reaction conditions. However, the number of photochemical transformations that allow successful protein bioconjugation is still limited because of the need for stringent reaction conditions. Herein, we report that a newly developed water&#8208;compatible fluorescent photosensitizer Q PEG  can be used for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cysteine&#8208;specific bioconjugation for the installation of Q PEG  by exploiting its intrinsic photosensitizing ability to activate the S&#8211;H bond of cysteine. In addition, the slightly modified Q CAT  enables the effective photocatalytic cysteine&#8208;specific conjugation of biologically relevant groups. The superior reactivity and cysteine selectivity of this methodology was further corroborated by traceless bioconjugation with a series of complex peptides and proteins under biocompatible conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are readily shaped into large area 2D photonic crystals by means of nanoimprinting lithography, as shown L. Polavarapu, A. Mihi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006152). The periodic patterning provides efficient light coupling to the nanocrystal layer, increasing the electric field intensity within the perovskite film and resulting in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) under lower optical excitation fluences in the near&#8208;IR. The cover image illustrates the nanocrystal assembly process and the resulting photonic architecture after the mold is removed.

Etzold and co&#8208;workers propose a new facile way to probe the CO2 reduction pathways on copper by employing ionic liquid as a chemical trapping agent, which altered the product spectrum by selective suppressing the formation of ethylene, ethanol, and n&#8208;propanol. Analyzing the altered product spectrum provides a unique way to disentangle complex reaction networks of CO2 reduction.

      <title>Vivid Wording for the Chemistry of Group 4 Metallocene Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Simple, illustrative words nicely explain the fundamental characteristics of organometallic compounds and their reactivity. For Group 4 metallocene complexes unusual descriptors like &#8220;tuck(ed)&#8208;in&#8221;, &#8220;merry&#8208;go&#8208;round reaction&#8221;, and &#8220;sliding&#8221;, &#8220;migration&#8221;, or &#8220;tobogganing&#8221; have been used. These terms are explained and discussed in detail. Unusual wording is helpful for a better understanding of complex structures and reaction motifs.







Abstract
Three selected examples for the use of unusual wording to describe the organometallic chemistry of Group 4 metallocenes are explained and discussed. The term &#8220;tuck(ed)&#8208;in&#8221; concerns the behavior of decamethyltitanocene [(C5Me5)2Ti] and similar complexes in which one or two methyl groups form the titanium hydride complex [(C5Me5)(C5Me4CH2)TiH] or other hydride complexes by C&#8722;H activation. In the so&#8208;called &#8220;merry&#8208;go&#8208;round reaction&#8221; the rearrangement of C atoms bound to titanium in organometallic molecules is described which corresponds to the rotation of two C atoms along with a rotation of the six&#8208;membered ring in a dihydroindenyl moiety at titanium. In the third example &#8220;migration&#8221; or &#8220;tobogganing&#8221; concerns the &#8220;sliding&#8221; of titanocene along the chain of a linear polyyne by coordination to one or more triple bonds. In all these reactions changes of the coordination mode of the metal at Cp or substrate ligands by intramolecular dynamics occur.

&lt;p&gt;Three selected examples for the use of unusual wording to describe the organometallic chemistry of Group 4 metallocenes are explained and discussed. The term &#8220;tuck(ed)&#8208;in&#8221; concerns the behavior of decamethyltitanocene [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti] and similar complexes in which one or two methyl groups form the titanium hydride complex [(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)TiH] or other hydride complexes by C&#8722;H activation. In the so&#8208;called &#8220;merry&#8208;go&#8208;round reaction&#8221; the rearrangement of C atoms bound to titanium in organometallic molecules is described which corresponds to the rotation of two C atoms along with a rotation of the six&#8208;membered ring in a dihydroindenyl moiety at titanium. In the third example &#8220;migration&#8221; or &#8220;tobogganing&#8221; concerns the &#8220;sliding&#8221; of titanocene along the chain of a linear polyyne by coordination to one or more triple bonds. In all these reactions changes of the coordination mode of the metal at Cp or substrate ligands by intramolecular dynamics occur.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
An iridium(III)&#8208;based long&#8208;lived theranostic agent for gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) has been developed. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007920), C.&#8208;H. Leung, D.&#8208;L. Ma et&#8197;al. report an iridium(III) complex that selectively visualizes GRPr in living cancer cells while modulating the function of GRPr in immune cells. The complex serves as a versatile probe to unmask the multi&#8208;functional roles of GRPr in living systems, while helping to accurately identify tumours and their biological characteristics.

      <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising tool for chiral&#8208;label&#8208;free discrimination of small aromatic molecules with the advantage of synchronous distinction and identification. As discussed by Y. Wang, Z. Yu, Y.

      <title>Construction of Highly Active Metal&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles &amp; FeCo&#8208;N4 Composite Sites for Acid Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;containing nanoparticles (M&#8208;NPs) in metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have been considered hostile to acid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Some works have confirmed that M&#8208;NPs can synergistically increase ORR activity in alkaline media. However, the relation between M&#8208;NPs and the active sites of metal coordinated with nitrogen (MNx) is hard to be established in acid medium due to the poor stability of M&#8208;NPs. Herein, we develop a strategy to successfully construct a new FeCo&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst containing the highly active M&#8208;NPs and MN4  composite sites (marked as M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C). The enhanced catalytic activity and stability of M/FeCo&#8208;SAs&#8208;N&#8208;C is discovered in our systematic experiments. Moreover, theoretical calculation reveals that there is a strong interaction between M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  sites, which can favor ORR by activating the O&#8208;O bond, thus facilitating a direct 4e&#8208;  process. Those findings firstly shed light on the highly active M&#8208;NPs and FeN4  composite sites for catalyzing acid oxygen reduction reaction, and the relevant reaction mechanism is suggested.</dc:description>

      <title>Unusual Type II Polyketide Synthase System Involved in Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>As a unique structural moiety in natural products, cinnamoyl lipid (CL), was proposed to be assembled  via  unusual type II polyketide synthases (PKSs).

      <title>Probing cooperativity of N&#8208;terminal domain orientations in the p97 molecular machine: synergy between NMR and cryo&#8208;EM</title>
      <dc:description>The hexameric p97 enzyme plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis. Large changes to the orientation of its N&#8208;terminal domains (NTDs), corresponding to NTD&#8208;down (p97&#8208;ADP) or NTD&#8208;up (p97&#8208;ATP), accompany ATP hydrolysis. The NTDs in a series of p97 disease mutants interconvert rapidly between up and down conformations when p97 is in the ADP&#8208;bound state. While the populations of up and down NTDs can be determined from bulk measurements, information about the cooperativity of the transition between conformations is lacking. Here we use cryo&#8208;EM to determine populations of the 14 unique up/down NTD states of the homo&#8208;hexameric R95G disease&#8208;causing p97 ring, showing that NTD orientations do not depend on those of neighbouring subunits. In contrast, NMR studies establish that inter&#8208;protomer cooperativity is important for regulating the orientation of NTDs in p97 particles comprising mixtures of different subunits, such as wild&#8208;type and R95G, emphasizing the synergy between cryo&#8208;EM and NMR in establishing how the components of p97 function.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible soft&#8208;mechanochemical control of biaryl conformations through crosslinking in a 3D macromolecular network</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the dihedral angle (DA) of axially chiral compounds can impact biological activity, catalyst efficiency, molecular motor performance, or chiroptical properties. Herein, we report gradual, controlled and reversible changes in molecular conformation of a covalently linked binaphthyl moiety, within a 3D polymeric network by the application of a macroscopic stretching force. We managed a direct observation of the DA changes by measuring the circular dichroism signal of an optically pure BINOL&#8208;crosslinked elastomer network. In accordance with computed spectra, stretching the elastomer resulted in a widening of the DA between naphthyl rings when the BINOL was doubly&#8208;grafted to the elastomer network, while no effect was observed when a single naphthyl ring of the BINOL was grafted to the elastomer network. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we have determined that ~170% extension of the elastomers led to the transfer of a mechanical force to the BINOL moiety of 2.5 kcal*mol  &#8208;1  *&#197;  &#8208;1  (~175 pN) in magnitude and results in the opening of the DA of BINOL up to ~130&#176;.</dc:description>

We managed a direct observation of the DA changes by measuring the circular dichroism signal of an optically pure BINOL&#8208;crosslinked elastomer network. In accordance with computed spectra, stretching the elastomer resulted in a widening of the DA between naphthyl rings when the BINOL was doubly&#8208;grafted to the elastomer network, while no effect was observed when a single naphthyl ring of the BINOL was grafted to the elastomer network. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we have determined that ~170% extension of the elastomers led to the transfer of a mechanical force to the BINOL moiety of 2.5 kcal*mol  &#8208;1  *&#197;  &#8208;1  (~175 pN) in magnitude and results in the opening of the DA of BINOL up to ~130&#176;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Preparation of Nafion&#174; Membranes for Reliable Ammonia Quantification in Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Experiments</title>
      <dc:description>This study highlights the importance of following a strict protocol for Nafion&#174; membrane pretreatment for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction experiments. It is shown how atmospheric ammonia pollutions can be introduced to the experimental setup through the membranes, therefore, interpreted falsely as catalysis product from N  2  . The sources of ammonia contamination vary drastically between different locations worldwide and even within the same location between days depending on temperature, wind direction, fertilizer use and manure accumulation in its vicinity. The study shows that significant amounts of ammonium is accumulated in the membranes after commonly practiced pretreatment methods, where the amount depends on the ammonia concentration in the surrounding of the experiment. Therefore, we introduce a new pretreatment method which removes all the ammonium in the membrane. The membranes can be stored for several days but a short final step in the method needs to be carried out right before NRR experiments.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A robust surface between molecules and electrodes is very important for constructing molecular and electronic devices.

      <title>Redox Dyshomeostasis Strategy for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy  Based on DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Electrophilic ZIFs</title>
      <dc:description>Redox   homeostasis  is one of the main reasons  for reactive oxygen species  (ROS) tolerance in hypoxic tumors, limiting ROS&#8208;mediated tumor therapy.

These &#8220;disordered&#8221; cells show reduced resistance to ROS  and are effectively killed by ferrous cysteine&#8208;phosphotungstate (FeCysPW)&#8208;induced chemodynamic therapy (CDT).

Here, we introduce a new multivalent interaction&#8208;driven assembly strategy that allows flexible, spaced, and asymmetric assembly between protein oligomers.

      <title>Structural Phase Transitions of a Molecular Metal Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The structural phase of a metal oxide changes with temperature and pressure. During phase transitions, component ions move in multi&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;oxygen networks. Such macroscopic structural events are robust to changes in particle size, even at scales of around 10 nm, and size effects limiting these transitions are particularly important in, for example, high&#8208;density memory applications of ferroelectrics. In this work, we examine structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO  3  )  2  (  n  &#8208;BuPO  3  )  4  Mo  V  4  Mo  VI  14  O  49  ]  5&#8722;  (Molecule  1  ) at&#160;~2 nm, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na  +  encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature. Similar order&#8211;disorder transitions were also triggered by chemical pressure induced by removing crystalline solvent molecules in the single&#8208;crystal state or by substituting the counter cation to change the molecular packing. Molecule  1  is&#160;the metal oxide in which a macroscopic structural transition has been observed.</dc:description>

      <title>Deoxygenative Fluorination of Phosphine Oxides: A General Route to Fluorinated Organophosphorus(V) Compounds and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorinated organophosphorus(V) compounds are a very versatile class of compounds, but the synthetic methods available to make them bear the disadvantages of 1) occasional handling of toxic or pyrophoric P(III) starting materials and 2) a dependence on hazardous fluorinating reagents such as XeF  2  . Herein, we present a simple solution and introduce a deoxygenative fluorination (DOF) approach that utilizes easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phosphine oxides as starting materials and effectively replaces harsh fluorinating reagents by a combination of oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride. The reaction has proven to be general, as R  3  PF  2  , R  2  PF  3  , and RPF  4  compounds (as well as various cations and anions derived from these) are accessible in good yields and on up to a multi&#8208;gram scale. DFT calculations were used to bolster our observations.

      <title>Template&#8208;Directed Quantitative One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Homochiral Helical Cages Enabling Enantioselective Binding</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular imprinting technique and dynamic covalent chemistry were implemented to achieve quantitative one&#8208;pot syntheses of homochiral helical cages inside aromatic foldamers. One&#8208;handed helical cages P&#8208;1, M&#8208;1, P&#8208;2 and M&#8208;2 were assembled from their precursors in the presence of appropriate templates (d&#8208;, l&#8208;tartaric acid, d&#8208; and l&#8208;sorbitol, respectively) via three sequential steps in one pot: imine&#8208;linked chain elongation, template&#8208;induced folding and [4+2] cycloaddition between helical turns. These helical cages were proven to enantioselectively bind chiral guests used as the templates, and the differences between the association constants of enantiomeric guests were up to more than two orders of magnitude. The structures and binding modes of the cages were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and 1H NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Colyliform Crystalline 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Quasi&#8208;3D Topologies for Rapid I2 Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a smart approach to effectively improve the pore permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the object transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have fairly faster adsorption rate (2.51 g/h) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29 g/g. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability enable the QTD&#8208;COFs to be reliably applied to the rapid removal of radioactive iodine under special circumstances of emergency response to nuclear accidents.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoredox Catalysis Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Aryl Halides under Benign Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are among the most used methods for synthesizing aryl nitriles. Despite tremendous advances, cyanating an aryl halide in a facile and benign fashion has generally been unsuccessful. The challenge for this significant transformation is the strong affinity of cyanide for metal centers, which makes organometallic catalysis elusive by hampering oxidative addition and reductive elimination. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanations of aryl halides are readily enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, in which Ni(II) species are transiently oxidized to Ni(III) species, thereby facilitating the subsequent cyanide transfer and reductive elimination. Using this dual catalysis strategy, we cyanated aryl and alkenyl halides at room temperature in a highly benign manner (30 examples, 53&#8208;93% yields) by avoiding the use of air&#8208;sensitive ligands, Ni(0) processors, and hypertoxic cyanation reagents, while also not generating excess metal waste.

Our results demonstrate that it is possible to harness non&#8208;classical crystal growth to fabricate organic molecular crystals with novel topologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Insights gained from a comparison of aminometalation reactions with lithium amides, potassium amides and mixed lithium/potassium amides are presented. A combination of structural characterization, DFT calculations and electrophile reactions of aminometalated intermediates has shown the advantages of using a mixed metal strategy. While potassium amides fail to add, the lithium amides are uncontrollable and eliminated, yet the mixed K/Li amides deliver the best of both.

      <title>Alternative Oxidants for the Catalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  . Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N  2  O, CO  2  , S  2  , and other non&#8208;O  2  oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O  2  &#8208;OCM.

      <title>Trapping Transient RNA Complexes by Chemically Reversible Acylation</title>
      <dc:description>RNA&#8208;RNA interactions are essential for biology, yet they can be difficult to study due to their transient nature. While crosslinking strategies can in principle be used to trap such interactions, virtually all existing strategies for crosslinking are poorly reversible, chemically modifying the RNA and hindering molecular analysis. Here, we describe a soluble crosslinker design (BINARI) that reacts with RNA via acylation. We find that it efficiently crosslinks noncovalent RNA complexes with miminal sequence bias and establish that the crosslink can be reversed by phosphine reduction of azide trigger groups, liberating the individual RNA components for further analysis. Use of the new approach is demonstrated by reversible protection against nuclease degradation and by trapping transient RNA complexes of E. coli DsrA&#8208;rpoS derived bulge&#8208;loop interactions, which underlines the potential of BINARI crosslinkers to probe RNA regulatory networks.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The science of particles on a sub&#8208;nanometer (~ 1 nm) scale has attracted worldwide attention. However, this field of science has remained unexplored because of the technical difficulty in the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoparticles (SNPs). Thus, we recently developed the &#8216;atom&#8208;hybridization method (AHM)&#8217; that precisely synthesizes the SNPs by using a suitably&#8208;designed macromolecule as a template. In this study, toward revealing this unexplored field, we newly investigated the chemical reactivity of alloy SNPs obtained by the AHM. Focusing on the coinage metal elements, the oxidation reaction of an olefin catalyzed by these SNPs was systematically evaluated. The SNPs showed a high catalytic performance even under the milder condition in contrast to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the hybridization of multiple elements enhanced the turnover frequency and the selectivity of the hydroperoxide derivative. We discuss the unique quantum&#8208;sized catalysts providing generally unstable hydroperoxides from the viewpoint of miniaturization and hybridization of the materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhizolutin, a novel 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone, dissociates misfolded protein aggregates and reduces apoptosis/inflammation associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
      <dc:description>Rhizolutin (  1  ) was discovered as a natural product of ginseng&#8208;rhizospheric  Streptomyces  sp. WON17. Its structure featured an unprecedented 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone carbon skeleton composed of dimethylcyclodecatriene flanked by a 7&#8208;membered and a 6&#8208;membered lactone ring based on spectroscopic analysis.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rhizolutin (  1  ) was discovered as a natural product of ginseng&#8208;rhizospheric  Streptomyces  sp. WON17. Its structure featured an unprecedented 7/10/6&#8208;tricyclic dilactone carbon skeleton composed of dimethylcyclodecatriene flanked by a 7&#8208;membered and a 6&#8208;membered lactone ring based on spectroscopic analysis.

      <title>Ultrafast Semi&#8208;Solid Processing of Highly Durable ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
      <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membrane has emerged as the most promising candidate for propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separation due to its precise molecular sieving characteristics. The poor reproducibility and durability, high cost, thus far pose challenges on the scalable synthesis and industrial application of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Herein, we report a semi&#8208;solid process featured with ultrafast and high&#8208;yield synthesis, and outstanding scalability for reproducible fabrication of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. The resultant membranes exhibit excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance in a wide range of temperature and pressure, and remarkable stability over a span of 6 months. The new ZIF&#8208;8 membrane features dimethylacetamide entrapped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals retainning same diffusion charactristics but offering enhanced adsorptive selectivity for C3H6/C3H8. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane was successfully fabricated on commercial flat&#8208;sheet ceramic substrate. A prototypical plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame membrane module with effective membrane area of about 300 cm2  was implemented for efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Overall, the reliable reproducibility and durability as well as scalability of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have greatly unlocked its commercialization potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Overcoming Fundamental Limitations in Adsorbent Design: Alkene Adsorption by Non&#8208;porous Copper(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Purifying alkenes from alkanes requires cryogenic distillation. At global scale, this consumes energy equivalent to countries of ca. 5 million people. Replacing distillation with adsorption processes would significantly increase energy efficiency. Trade&#8208;offs between kinetics, selectivity, capacity, and heat of adsorption have prevented production of an optimal adsorbent. We report adsorbents that overcome these trade&#8208;offs.  [Cu&#8208;Br]  3  and  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  are air&#8208;stable trinuclear complexes that undergo reversible solid&#8208;state inter&#8208;molecular rearrangements to produce dinuclear  [Cu&#8208;Br&#8226;(alkene)]  2  and  [Cu&#8208;H&#8226;(alkene)]  2  . The reversible solid&#8208;state rearrangement, confirmed  in&#8208;situ  using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, allows adsorbent design trade&#8208;offs to be overcome, coupling low heat of adsorption (&#8208;10 to &#8208;17 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  alkene  ), high alkene:alkane selectivity (47; 29), and uptake capacity (&gt;2.5 mol  alkene  &#183;mol  &#8208;1  Cu3  ). Most remarkably,  [Cu&#8208;H]  3  displays fast uptake and regenerates capacity within 10 minutes.</dc:description>

      <title>Sub&#8208;10 nm Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Quantum Dots Assembled by Microfluidics for Enhanced Tumor&#8208;Targeting and Reduced Retention in the Liver</title>
      <dc:description>A robust platform is developed to assemble sub&#8208;10 nm organic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) particles using four different AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with emissions from green to the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II). They are called AIE quantum dots (QDs) to distinguish from tipycal AIE dots which are larger than 25 nm. Compared with AIE dots that are larger than 25 nm, AIE QDs allow more efficient cellular uptake and imaging without surface modification of any membrane&#8208;penetrating peptides or other targeting molecules. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, which have nearly no background fluorescence from organisms, are used to demonstrate that AIE QDs can achieve high contrast at the tumor as small as 80 mm  3  , and evade the liver more efficiently than AIE dots. AIE QDs hold a good promise for sensitive and precise diagnosis of the latent solid tumor in clinical medicine with much lower off&#8208;targeting to the liver than AIE dots.</dc:description>

We explore UCNP composition, size, and lanthanide doping dependent emission, focusing on upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and UV emission. UCQY values of 2.46% at 250 W/cm  2  are achieved with 14.5 nm SrLuF@CaF  2  particles, with 7.3% of total emission in the UV.

      <title>Ag+&#8208;Coupled Black Phosphorus Vesicles with Emerging NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Performance for Cancer Immune&#8208;Dynamic Therapy and Fast Wound Healing</title>
      <dc:description>Despite black phosphorus quantum dots (BP QDs) have been revealed their significant prospects in biomedical field, virtually no reports involved BP QDs&#8217;s optical imaging in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region due to the unsatisfactory NIR&#8208;II light absorption property of BP QDs. Herein, a silver ion (Ag  +  )&#8208;coupled BP vesicle (BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  ) with a pioneering NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging capability was firstly constructed to maximize BP QD&#8217;s potential in deeper bioimaging and diversified therapy. Notably, based on theoretical simulation analysis results, we convinced that the embedded Ag  +  could improve the relatively large bandgap of BP QD  via  intense charge coupling, subsequently leading to the enhanced optical absorption capability, accompanied with the occurrence of the strong NIR&#8208;II PA signal. Guiding with the NIR&#8208;II PA bioimaging, the hidden Ag+ can be precisely released with the disassembly of Ve during photodynamic therapy (PDT) process and captured by macrophages located in lesion region for arousing synergistic cancer photodynamic/Ag  +  immunotherapy benefited from the integration of immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect and macrophages activation. Furthermore, BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  can contrapuntally kill pathogenic bacteria and accelerate wound healing with the assist of NIR&#8208;II PA imaging. Therefore, a BP Ve&#8208;Ag  +  with extra NIR&#8208;II PA imaging ability reveals a boundless prospect in the biomedical field.</dc:description>
