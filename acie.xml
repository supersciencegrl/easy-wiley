      <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Boronic Acids and the Thioimidate KAT Transfer Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>We report the synthesis of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of boronic acids and the thioimidate KAT transfer reagent. The combination of widely available aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids with commercially available thioimidate&#160;  1  &#160;using catalytic Pd  II  &#160; and a Cu  II  &#160;additive&#160; enables the preparation of KATs in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. This formal insertion of CO into organoboronic acids can also be applied to boronic acid pinacol esters and potassium organotrifluoroborates using a slightly modified procedure. The cross&#8208;coupling can be telescoped into the one&#8208;pot synthesis of amides and&#160; a &#8208;aminotrifluoroborates by exploiting the unique chemistry of KATs and their trifluoroborate iminium (TIM) derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Catalysts for Green Synthesis of Adipic Acid from Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Green synthesis of adipic acid from renewable biomass is a very attractive goal of sustainable chemistry. Herein, we report efficient catalysts for a two&#8208;step transformation of cellulose&#8208;derived glucose into adipic acid via glucaric acid. Carbon nanotube&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles are found to work efficiently for the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. An activated carbon&#8208;supported bifunctional catalyst composed of rhenium oxide and palladium is discovered to be powerful for the removal of four hydroxyl groups in glucaric acid, affording adipic acid with a 99% yield. Rhenium oxide functions for the deoxygenation but is less efficient for four hydroxyl&#8208;group removal. The co&#8208;presence of palladium not only catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefin intermediates but also synergistically facilitates the deoxygenation. This work presents a green route for adipic acid synthesis, and offers a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis strategy for efficient deoxygenation.</dc:description>

      <title>2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyridinium: A Bulky, Highly Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituent Which Enhances Properties of Nickel(II) Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of Ni(II) and Pd(II) olefin polymerization catalysts can be enhanced by introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the supporting ligands rendering the metal centers more electrophilic. Reported here is a comparison of ethylene polymerization activity of a classical salicyliminato nickel catalyst substituted with the powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group to its&#8217; &#8211;CF  3  analog. The trippy substituent is substantially more electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#963;  meta  = 0.63) than the trifluoromethyl group (&#963;  meta  = 0.43) which results in a ca. 8&#8208;fold increase in catalytic turnover frequency. An additional advantage of trippy is its&#8217; high steric bulk relative to the trifluoromethyl group. This feature results in a four&#8208;fold increase in polymer molecular weight due to enhanced retardation of chain transfer. A significant increase in catalyst lifetime is observed as well.</dc:description>

      <title>Electron Transfer Process in Mixed Valence Compounds with Low&#8208;lying Energy Bridge in Different Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, the mixed valent compounds with the iso&#8208;cyanidometal&#8208;ligand bridge in different oxidation states are used as models for the investigation of ET process. Thus, we synthesized and fully characterized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe]  n+  (n = 2 &#8208; 4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  3+  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  4+  ) compounds possess an isocyanidometal&#8208;bridge whose energy is respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the  N  4  +  compounds, the bridge&#8208;state (Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  III  &#8208;Fe  II  ) and mixed valence states (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  II  or Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) could be simultaneous observed on the IR time&#8208;scale, supported by the ground state Potential Energy Surface (PES) that indicates as the number of methyl groups of Cp increases the ET excited mixed valence state becomes more and more stable. Whereas, for the  N  4  +  compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the ET excited bridge state (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru. Our findings might be helpful for better understanding the ET process in nature and for the design of novel electron transfer materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>All&#8208;DNA nanomedicines have emerged as potential anti&#8208;tumor drugs. DNA nanotechnology provides all&#8208;DNA nanomedicines unlimited possibilities in controlling the diversification of size, shape, and loads of the therapeutic motifs.

Herein, DNA&#8208;dendrimer&#8208;based nanomedicines are designed to adapt to the biological production, which is constructed by the flexible 3&#8208;arm building blocks to enable a highly efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; DNA assembly. For the first time, a DNA nanomedicine, D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur, is successfully genetically encoded, biotechnological produced, and directly self&#8208;assembled. By the following  in vitro  and  in vivo  studies, the performance of the biologically produced D4&#8208;3&#8208;As&#8208;DzSur in targeted gene regulation has been confirmed.

      <dc:description>Manipulating the stereochemistry of polymers is a powerful method to alter their physical properties. Despite the chirality of monosaccharides, reports on the impact of stereochemistry in natural polysaccharides and synthetic carbohydrate polymers remain absent. Herein, we report the cocrystallization of regio&#8208; and stereoregular polyethers derived from D&#8208; and L&#8208;xylose, leading to enhanced thermal properties compared to the enantiopure polymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stereocomplex between carbohydrate polymers of opposite chirality.

      <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier&#8208;Hosting Potential Compensation&#8203;</title>
      <dc:description>Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from insufficient electrochemistry and low carrier&#8208;hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry with carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, high&#8208;energy Mg2+  /Na+  hybrid batteries are achieved. Typically, an unprecedented Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3(MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4  (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, realizing a reliable high&#8208;voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+  ), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4 mA h g&#8722;1  at 0.5 A g&#8722;1  , 92.7 Wh kg&#8722;1  electrode  , i.e. 1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). Simultaneously, resorting to the relatively high Na+  &#8208;hosting potential in electrodes, the low Mg  2+  &#8208;hosting potential flaw is well&#8208;compensated. This synergistically widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50 V. After 1350 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  , a low capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle is obtained, and the plateau is well retained.

      <title>Almost 100% peroxymonosulfate conversion to singlet oxygen on single&#8208;atom CoN2+2 sites</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom CoN  4  active sites have demonstrated excellent efficiency in peroxymonosulfate activation. However, the identification of CoN  4  active sites and the detailed singlet oxygen generation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate activation still remain ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species by atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. As assisted by experimental and DFT calculations, CoN  2+2  was the definite active sites. Singlet oxygen was the absolutely predominant reactive oxygen species that the proportion was 98.89%. Different from the traditional CoN  4  configuration, the CoN  2+2  active sites transformed the pathway of peroxymonosulfate activation and facilitated the singlet oxygen generation. Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on Co single atoms was prevented due to the energy barriers caused by weak positive Co atoms and CoN  2+2  coordination, determining PMS oxidation in non&#8208;radical pathway and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen showed efficient activity for degradation of several organic pollutants in a broad pH range.</dc:description>

Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on Co single atoms was prevented due to the energy barriers caused by weak positive Co atoms and CoN  2+2  coordination, determining PMS oxidation in non&#8208;radical pathway and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen showed efficient activity for degradation of several organic pollutants in a broad pH range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Shape&#8208;switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Here, we 4D&#8208;print shape&#8208;switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks and azobenzene. The salient property of shape&#8208;switching LCEs is that light induces long&#8208;lived, deformation that can be recovered on&#8208;demand by heating. UV&#8208;light isomerizes azobenzene from  trans  to  cis  , and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape&#8208;switching LCEs fix more than 90% of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape&#8208;switching properties, we print Braille&#8208;like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.</dc:description>

For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the electrochemical kinetics of electrodes. We report here a quantitative assessment of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.8O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC) &#8208; being sluggish at low SOC while increasing rapidly as SOC increases both in the bulk electrode and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode.

      <title>Prevent or Cure &#8211; The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, e.g. prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A bis&#8208;urea&#8208;functionalized ditopic subcomponent assembled with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and FeII  , resulting in a dynamic library of metal&#8208;organic assemblies: an irregular FeII4L6  structure, and three FeII2L3  stereoisomers: left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helicates and a  meso  &#8208;structure. This library reconfigured in response to the addition of monosaccharide derivatives, which served as guests for specific library members, and the rate of saccharide mutarotation was also enhanced by the library. The (P) enantiomer of the FeII2L3  helical structure bound &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose selectively over &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose. As a consequence, the library collapsed into the (P)&#8208;FeII2L3  helicate following glucose addition. The &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose was likewise transformed into the &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;anomer during equilibration and binding. Thus, &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose and (P)&#8208;3  amplified each other in the product mixture, as metal&#8208;organic and saccharide libraries geared together into a single equilibrating system.</dc:description>

      <title>An ER&#8208;Targeting Iridium(III) Complex which Induces Immunogenic Cell Death in Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>

The characteristic discharge of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), i.e. cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), extracellular exclusion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and ATP, were generated by  Ir1  in A549 lung cancer cells, accompanied by an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The vaccination of immunocompetent mice with  Ir1  &#8208;treated dying cells elicited an antitumor CD8  +  T cell response and Foxp3  +  T cell depletion, which eventually resulted in long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;tumor immunity by the activation of ICD in lung cancer cells. With the dual actions of ICD and chemotherapy against NSCLC,  Ir1  has great potential as an antitumor agent. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir1  is the first iridium&#8208;based complex that is capable of developing an immunomodulatory response by immunogenic cell death.</dc:description>

      <title>Opening magnetic hysteresis by axial ferromagnetic coupling: from mono&#8208;decker to double&#8208;decker metallacrown</title>
      <dc:description>Combining Ising&#8208;type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge.

Linking two Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double&#8208;decker {Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5]}2 (2&#8208;Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2&#8208;Dy that are ca. 200,000 times slower at 2 K than for 1&#8208;Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1&#8208;Dy and the YIII&#8208;diluted Dy@2&#8208;Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2&#8208;Dy remain open up to 6 K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy&#8208;Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM).

      <title>Dual&#8208;propelled lanbiotic based Janus micromotors for selective inactivation of bacteria biofilms</title>
      <dc:description>Graphene oxide/PtNPs/Fe2O3&#8220;dual&#8208;propelled&#8221; catalytic and fuel&#8208;free rotary actuated magnetic Janus micromotors modified with the antimicrobial peptide Nisin are used for highly selective capture/inactivation of gram&#8208;positive bacteria units and biofilms. Specific interaction of Nisin with the Lipid II unit of Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria in connection with the enhanced micromotor movement and generated fluid flow results in a 2&#8208;fold increase of the capture/killing ability (both in bubble and magnetic propulsion modes) as compared with free peptide and static counterparts. The high stability of Nisin along with the high towing force of the micromotors allow for efficient micromotor operation in untreated raw media (tap water, juice and serum) and even in blood and in flowing blood in magnetic mode. The high selectivity of the approach is illustrated by the dramatically lower interaction with gram&#8208;negative bacteria (Escherichia Coli). The double&#8208;propulsion (catalytic or fuel&#8208;free magnetic) mode of the micromotors and the high biocompatibility holds considerable promise to design micromotors with tailored lanbiotics that can response to the changes that make the bacteria resistant in a myriad of clinical, environmental remediation or food safety applications.</dc:description>

The penta&#8208; or hexa&#8208;coordinate thiolate heme (9 &#8804; pH &#8804; 11) and the penta&#8208;coordinate imidazole heme (6 &#8804; pH &#8804; 8.5) reproduces well the heme ligation in chloroperoxidases or cyt P450 monooxygenases and peroxidases, respectively. The stability of heme coordination upon ferric/ferrous redox cycling is a crucial property of the construct.

      <title>Tailored Catalytic Nanoframes from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Anisotropic Surface Modification and Etching</title>
      <dc:description>The rational design and synthesis of frame&#8208;like hollow structures with unique three&#8208;dimensional open architectures for their diverse applications is still challenging. We herein propose a facile anisotropic surface modification and etching strategy for the synthesis of hollow structured ZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. Our strategy relies on the structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). Thereby, the CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. Interestingly, the surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts via an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination in reducing atmosphere, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hydrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. Among them, the PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9 wt.% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions, outperforming the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Our results offer insight into the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with compositional and structural multiplicity, which in turn could encourages more practical catalytic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Construction of Borromean Linked Crystalline Organic Polymers</title>

      <title>The Trojan Horse Goes Wild: The Effect of Drug Loading on the Behavior of Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Drug delivery is often compared to a Trojan Horse, as the drugs are hidden inside nanoparticles (equivalent to the Trojan Horse) and they enter cells (e.g. cancer cells) in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. However, it seems that drug loading can influence the properties of the nanoparticles, which are detected by the cell. As a result, the cell can reject the nanoparticle; thus, loading large amounts of drugs can be damaging to drug delivery efforts.







Abstract
Drug delivery with nanoparticles is sometimes compared to an attack with a Trojan Horse. The drugs are hidden in nanoparticles and enter the unsuspecting cells in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. Here, I would like to share my thoughts that a comparison to the Trojan Horse does not always apply, and provide examples where an increased drug loading content was detrimental to the drug&#8208;delivery process. The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.

      <title>Photoacoustic Cavitation&#8208;Ignited Reactive Oxygen Species to Amplify Peroxynitrite Burst by Photosensitization&#8208;free Polymeric Nanocapsules</title>
      <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) technology can transform light energy into acoustic wave   , which  can be used for either imaging or therapy that depends on the power density of pulsed laser. Here, we report photosensitizer&#8208;free polymeric nanocapsules loaded with nitric oxide (NO) donors, namely NO&#8208;NCPs, formulated from  NIR light&#8208;absorbable amphiphilic polymers  and a NO&#8208;releasing donor, DETA NONOate. Controlled NO release and nanocapsule dissociation are achieved in acidic lysosomes of cancer cells. More importantly, upon pulsed laser irradiation, the PA cavitation can excite water to generate significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical (O  2  &#8226;&#8208;  ), which further spontaneously reacts with the  in&#8208;situ  released NO to burst highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO  &#8208;  ) in cancer cells. The resultant ONOO  &#8208;  generation greatly promotes mitochondrial damage and DNA fragmentation to initiate programmed cancer cell death. Apart from PA imaging, PA cavitation can intrinsically amplify reactive species via photosensitization&#8208;free materials for promising disease theranostics.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Active Cooperative Lewis Acid &#8211; Ammonium Salt Catalyst for the Enantioselective Hydroboration of Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>Enantiopure secondary alcohols are fundamental high&#8208;value synthetic building blocks. One of the most attractive ways to get access to this compound class is the catalytic hydroboration. We describe a new concept for this reaction type which allowed for exceptional catalytic turnover numbers (up to 15400), which were increased by around 1.5&#8208;3 orders of magnitude compared to the most active catalysts previously reported.

      <title>Phenotypic Discovery of Neuroprotective Agents by Regulation of Tau Proteostasis via Stress&#8208;Responsive Activation of PERK Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>Tau protein aggregates are a recognized neuropathological feature in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease as well as many other neurodegenerative disorders, known as tauopathies. The development of tau&#8208;targeting therapies is therefore extremely important but efficient strategies or protein targets are still unclear. Here, we performed a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and identified a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal tau protein aggregation. By applying label&#8208;free target identification technology, we revealed that the transient enhancement of protein kinase&#8208;like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling pathway through the inhibition of stress&#8208;responsive SB1617 targets, PDIA3 and DNAJC3, is an effective strategy for regulating proteostasis in tauopathies. The molecular mechanism and the promising efficacy of SB1617 were demonstrated in neuronal cells and a mouse model with traumatic brain injury, a tauopathy known to involve ER stress.</dc:description>

Here, we performed a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and identified a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal tau protein aggregation. By applying label&#8208;free target identification technology, we revealed that the transient enhancement of protein kinase&#8208;like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling pathway through the inhibition of stress&#8208;responsive SB1617 targets, PDIA3 and DNAJC3, is an effective strategy for regulating proteostasis in tauopathies. The molecular mechanism and the promising efficacy of SB1617 were demonstrated in neuronal cells and a mouse model with traumatic brain injury, a tauopathy known to involve ER stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Unexpected Elasticity in Assemblies of Glassy Supra&#8208;Nanoparticle Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Granular materials, composed of densely packed particles, are known to possess unique mechanical properties that are highly dependent on the surface structure of the particles. A microscopic understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these systems remains unclear. Here, supra&#8208;nanoparticle clusters (SNPCs) with precise structures are developed as model systems to elucidate the structure&#8208;property relationship. SNPCs are prepared by coordination&#8208;driven assembly of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) with metal&#8208;organic polyhedron. Due to the disparity in sizes, the POSS&#8208;MOP assemblies, like their classic nanoparticles counterparts, ordering is suppressed, and the POSS&#8208;MOP mixtures will vitrify or jam as a function of decreasing temperature. An unexpected elasticity is observed for the SNPC assemblies with a high modulus that is maintained at temperatures far beyond the glass transition temperature. From studies on the dynamics of the hierarchical structures of SNPCs and molecular dynamic simulation, the elasticity has its origins in the interpenetration of POSS&#8208;ended arms. The physical molecular interpenetration and inter&#8208;locking phenomenon favors the convenient solution or pressing processing of the novel cluster&#8208;based elastomers.</dc:description>

      <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain&#8208;of&#8208;Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>Click reactions, which are commonly used in the challenging task of biology&#8208;oriented modular conjugation, have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility, and they accelerate the generation of molecules possessing well&#8208;de&#64257;ned functions. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers,&#8221; whose binding affinity is regulated by the "clip"&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de novo selection of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; can achieve the efficient transition from a binding inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results proved that the &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221; hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.</dc:description>

With 1,2&#8208;diaryl substituted cyclopropenes, this methodology could be extended to a one pot synthesis of highly functionalized polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs).

      <title>&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives: A Storable Feedstock for Preparation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
      <dc:description>The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffold is useful in medicinal chemistry, and many protocols are available for synthesizing BCP derivatives from [1.1.1]propellane. However, little progress has been made in the preparation of [1.1.1]propellane since the first practical synthesis in 1985. Here, we report the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of BCP derivatives, affording a stable, readily storable material from which BCPs can be easily and quantitatively recovered. We have also developed new and simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP to afford [1.1.1]propellane in protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar solvents. The combination of these methodologies enables simple, on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in various solvents under mild conditions from &#945;&#8208;CD capsules containing 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP.</dc:description>

      <title>Dimer organization of membrane&#8208;associated NS5A of hepatitis C virus as determined by highly sensitive&#160;1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
      <dc:description>The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Here we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated&#160;via&#160;synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self&#8208;interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the&#160;first characterization&#160;of NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;nitrido species are nitrogen analogues of iron&#8208;oxo species which are versatile reagents for C&#8211;H oxidation. Nonetheless, C&#8211;H activation by iron&#8208;nitrido species has been scarcely explored, as this is often hampered by their instability and short lifetime in solutions. Herein, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of an Fe porphyrin nitrido species (  2c  ) toward C&#8211;H substrates was studied in solutions at room temperature, which was achieved by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of its Fe(III)&#8208;azido precursor (  1c  ) supported by a bulky bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. C&#8211;H bonds with bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of up to ~84 kcal mol  &#8208;1  could be activated, and the second&#8208;order rate constants (  k  2  ) are on the order of 10  2  &#8211;10  4  s  &#8208;1  M  &#8208;1  .

      <title>Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper&#160;Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the extensive development in trifluoromethylation, introduction of a trifluoromethyl group into an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond is significantly challenging. Herein, we report the development of a mild and operationally simple C(sp3)&#8211;H trifluoromethylation method for unactivated alkanes utilizing a bench&#8208;stable Cu(III) complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as a visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;induced reaction initiator, a trifluoromethyl radical source as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and a trifluoromethyl anion source for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by reactive electrophilic carbon&#8208;centered CF3 radical generation from photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, which performs hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C&#8211;CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical&#8208;polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The newly developed reaction can be applied to various methylene selective trifluoromethylation reactions including direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Improved Asparaginyl Ligase&#8208;catalyzed Transpeptidation via Selective Nucleophile Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>The use of enzymes for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins/peptides has become a highly accessible, widespread approach to study protein/peptide functions or to generate therapeutic conjugates. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) that preferentially catalyze transpeptidation reactions (AEP ligases) have emerged as enticing alternatives to established approaches, such as bacterial sortases, due to their catalytic efficiency and short tripeptide recognition motifs. However, under standard conditions, a substantial excess of the nucleophile to be conjugated is needed to reach desirable yields. Herein we report a versatile approach to shift the AEP&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation equilibrium toward product formation via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the competing leaving group peptide. Our metal complexation&#8208;based strategy enables efficient peptide/protein labeling at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus with near&#8208;equimolar concentrations of nucleophile label. Furthermore, we show that this approach can enhance protein&#8208;protein ligation and facilitate the formation of transpeptidation products that are otherwise unattainable.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of b&#8208;fluoroalkylamines with broad scope is reported for the first time. Use of the air&#8208;stable pre&#8208;catalyst (PAd2&#8208;DalPhos)Ni(o&#8208;tol)Cl allows for reactions to be conducted at room temperature (25 &#186;C, NaOtBu), or by use of a commercially available dual&#8208;base system (100 &#186;C, DBU/NaOTf), to circumvent decomposition of the N&#8208;(b&#8208;fluoroalkyl)aniline product. The mild protocols disclosed herein feature broad (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide scope (X = Cl, Br, I, and for the first time phenol derived electrophiles), encompassing base sensitive substrates and enantioretentive transformations, in a manner that is unmatched by any previously reported catalyst system.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Selective N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2 Catalyzed by Porous Organometallic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2  capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2  adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2  and H2  under mild reaction conditions even at 20 ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON = 1.58 &#215; 106  ) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.</dc:description>

      <title>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of chemically and biologically diverse pyrroquinoline pseudo natural products</title>
      <dc:description>Natural product (NP) structure is a rich source of inspiration for the discovery of new biologically relevant chemical matter. In natural product inspired pseudo&#8208;NPs, NP&#8208;derived fragments are combined de novo to unprecedented arrangements. This design principle will be particularly efficient, if the combination of a set of common fragments in different connectivity patterns or regioisomeric arrangements yield chemically diverse compound collections with diverse biological performance. We describe the design and synthesis of a 155&#8208;membered pyrroquinoline pseudo&#8208;NP collection in which fragments characteristic of the tetrahydroquinoline&#8208; and pyrrolidine NP classes are combined in eight different connectivities and regioisomeric arrangements. Cheminformatic analysis and biological evaluation of the compound collection by means of phenotyping in the morphological &#8220;cell painting&#8221; assay followed by principal component analysis revealed that the pseudo&#8208;NP classes are chemically diverse and that bioactivity patterns markedly differ dependent of connectivity and regioisomeric arrangement of the fragments.</dc:description>
