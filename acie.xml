         <title>Werner Salt as Nickel and Ammonia Source for Photochemical Synthesis of Primary Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cheap, stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Werner ammine salts have been known for more than a century; but they have been rarely used in organic synthesis. Herein, we report that the Werner hexammine complex [Ni(NH&#8323;)&#8326;]Cl&#8322; can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of&#160; bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8208;395 nm light without the need of any additional catalysts. More than 80 aryl chlorides, including more than 20 drug molecules, were aminated, demonstrating the practicality and generality of this method in synthetic chemistry. A slow NH3 release mechanism is in operation, obviating the problem of catalyst poisoning. Still interestingly, we show that the Werner salt can be easily recovered and reused, solving the problem of easy deactivation and difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts. The protocol thus provides an efficient new strategy for the synthesis of primary aryl amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic excitonic state management by surface metallic coupling of inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to organic chromophores, when the organics are approaching to the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8208;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Antioxidation Kinetics of Glutathione Intracellularly Monitored by a Dual&#8208;Wire Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual&#8208;wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale, but the elimination process is short&#8208;lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance&#8208;related physiological.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical proteomic discovery of isotype&#8208;selective covalent inhibitors of the RNA Methyltransferase NSUN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Methylcytosine (m5C) is an RNA modification prevalent on tRNAs, where it can protect tRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage to maintain protein synthesis. The NSUN family (NSUN1&#8208;7 in humans) of RNA methyltransferases is responsible for installing the methyl group onto the C5 position of cytosine in RNA. NSUNs are implicated in a wide range of (patho)physiological processes, but selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of these enzymes are lacking. Here, we use cysteine&#8208;directed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) to discover azetidine acrylamides that act as stereoselective covalent inhibitors of human NSUN2. Despite targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine in the NSUN family, the NSUN2 inhibitors show negligible crossreactivity with other human NSUNs and exhibit good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. We verify that the azetidine acrylamides inhibit the catalytic activity of recombinant NSUN2, but not NSUN6, and demonstrate that these compounds stereoselectively disrupt NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions in cancer cells, leading to a global reduction in tRNA m5C content. Our findings thus highlight the potential to create isotype&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of NSUN2 with covalent chemistry targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid charge transfer endowed by interfacial Ni&#8208;O bonding in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for efficient photocatalytic H2 and imine production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative coupling of H2 evolution with oxidative organic synthesis is promising in avoiding the use of sacrificial agents and producing hydrogen energy with value&#8208;added chemicals simultaneously. Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity is obstructed by sluggish electron&#8208;hole separation and limited redox potentials. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped Zn0.2Cd0.8S quantum dots are chosen after screening by DFT simulation to couple with TiO2 microspheres, forming a step&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The Ni&#8208;doped configuration tunes the highly active S site for augmented H2 evolution, and the interfacial Ni&#8208;O bonds provide fast channels at the atomic level to lower the energy barrier for charge transfer. Also, DFT calculations reveal an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field in the heterojunction for superior charge migration and separation. Kinetic analysis by femtosecond transient absorption spectra demonstrates that expedited charge migration with electrons first transfer to Ni2+ and then to S sites. Therefore, the designed catalyst delivers drastically elevated H2 yield (6.96 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine production rate (3.19 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into the coordinated modulation of active sites and built&#8208;in electric fields in step&#8208;scheme heterojunction for ameliorative photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Synergy between Fe and Mo sites in the Nitrate Reduction Reaction on a Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic MXene Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mo&#8208; and Fe&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the reduction of nitrate and nitrite ions in nature. Inspired by this activity, we study here the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) catalyzed by an Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide of the MXene family, viz., Mo2CTx:Fe (Tx are oxo, hydroxy and fluoro surface termination groups). Mo2CTx:Fe contains isolated Fe sites in Mo positions of the host MXene (Mo2CTx) and features a Faradaic efficiency (FE) and an NH3 yield rate of 41% and 3.2 &#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1, respectively, for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH4+ in acidic media and 70% and 12.9 &#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 in neutral media. Regardless of the media, Mo2CTx:Fe outperforms monometallic Mo2CTx owing to a more facile reductive defunctionalization of Tx groups, as evidenced by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Mo K&#8208;edge). After surface reduction, a Tx vacancy site binds a nitrate ion that subsequently fills the vacancy site with O* via oxygen transfer. Density function theory calculations provide further evidence that Fe sites promote the formation of surface O vacancies, which are identified as active sites and that function in NO3RR in close analogy to the prevailing mechanism of the natural Mo&#8208;based nitrate reductase enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Modes in the Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Allenes with Aryl Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines, in stark contrast to classic cycloaddition reactions, has been developed. This reaction delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimides with excellent stereoselectivities by a new uncyclized reaction mode involving &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes. Moreover, the present uncyclized reaction can also be carried out in a one&#8208;pot fashion and scaled up to the gram scale by using aryl aldehydes, without the need to isolate the aryl imines. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the possible mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Azidocyanation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difunctionalization of alkenes &#8208; a process that installs two functional groups in a single operation and transforms chemical feedstocks into value&#8208;added products &#8208; is one of the most appealing synthetic methods in contemporary chemistry. However, the introduction of two distinct functional groups via two readily accessible nucleophiles remains a formidable challenge. Existing intermolecular alkene azidocyanation methods, which primarily focus on aryl alkenes and rely on stoichiometric chemical oxidants. We report herein an unprecedented electrochemical strategy for alkene azidocyanation that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes. This is achieved by harnessing the finely&#8208;tuned anodic electron transfer and the strategic selection of copper/ligand complexes. The reactions of aryl alkenes were rendered enantioselective by employing a chiral ligand. Crucially, the mild conditions and well&#8208;regulated electrochemical process assure exceptional tolerance for various functional groups and substrate compatibility with both terminal and internal alkyl alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8722;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the coordination number is feasible to lower the rate&#8208;determination&#8208;step energy barrier, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. Our designed low&#8208;coordination IrOx delivers superior activity as well as excellent stability in water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8722;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8722;O coordination number's role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2 using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accompanied by long durability (100&#8197;h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEM water electrolyzer delivers a low voltage (1.72&#8197;V@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200&#8197;h (@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) based on aptamer&#8208;functionalized Au nanoparticles (&#8220;islands&#8221;) and fluid fluorescent aptamer ligands (&#8220;rafts&#8221;) was engineered on a microfluidic chip surface. HieFluidFace allowed to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions via spatiotemporal regulation of ligand distribution, and was used for efficient capture and direct identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples.







Abstract
In nature, regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors and ligands leads to optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics of receptor&#8211;ligand binding reactions within interfaces. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each aptamer&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticle, termed spherical aptamer (SAPT), is anchored on a supported lipid bilayer without fluidity, like an &#8220;island&#8221;, and is surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity, like &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;rafts&#8221; model provides a large reactive cross&#8208;section for rapid binding to cellular receptors. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed for building two types of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes via the phosphonium salt catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael reaction together with copper salt enabled aromatization. The scalability and practicality of this protocol were validated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and transformation of products, particularly towards producing novel helical phosphine ligands that were successfully utilized in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;doped copper nitride is a highly selective electrocatalyst for CO reduction to n&#8208;propanol leading to a record Faradaic Efficiency value of 45&#8201;% at an industrially&#8208;relevant current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, in an alkaline flow electrolyser.







Abstract
The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradaic efficiency: 45&#8201;%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradaic efficiency: 80&#8201;%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.

         <title>UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Harvesting Conjugated Porous Polymer Nanocomposite: Upconversion and Plasmon Expedited Thioether Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized upconversion nanoparticles are covalently linked to conjugated porous organic polymers, followed by the loading of gold nanoparticles to form a UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorbing photocatalyst, UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The synergistic influence of plasmon absorption and upconversion luminescence improves photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including the detoxification of chemical warfare agents under natural sunlight and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysts capable of harvesting a broad range of the solar spectrum are essential for sustainable chemical transformations and environmental remediation. Herein, we have integrated NIR&#8208;absorbing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) with UV&#8208;Vis absorbing conjugated porous organic polymer (POP) through the in situ multicomponent C&#8722;C coupling to fabricate a UC&#8722;POP nanocomposite. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of UC&#8722;POP is further augmented by loading plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNP) into UC&#8722;POP. A three&#8208;times enhancement in the upconversion luminescence is observed upon the incorporation of AuNP in UC&#8722;POP, subsequently boosting the photocatalytic activity of UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigations infer the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including mustard gas simulant by UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au compared to POP and UC&#8722;POP due to the facile electron&#8208;hole pair generation, suppressed exciton recombination, and efficient charge carrier migration. Thus, the unique design strategy of combining plasmonic and upconversion nanoparticles with a conjugated porous organic polymer opens up new vistas towards artificial light harvesting.

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low&#8208;Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: An Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cage with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands, with positional and orientational control, has been built by using ancillary pairings. In this approach, the ligands with Pd(II)&#8208;binding sites come together in complementary ways due to their denticity (3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 2&#8201;:&#8201;2) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA&#8201;:&#8201;DD or AD&#8201;:&#8201;DA).







Abstract
One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply stranded lantern&#8208;shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1)&#8197;the formation of heteroleptic (multi&#8208;ligand) assemblies, or 2)&#8197;homoleptic assemblies from low&#8208;symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low&#8208;symmetry ligands, a hybid of these two approaches, would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a cis position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites. By using this approach, we have successfully used low&#8208;symmetry ligands to synthesise complex heteroleptic cages, including an example with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands.

         <title>Significant Roles of Surface Hydrides in Enhancing the Performance of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the anionic site of catalyst supports can impact reaction pathways by creating active sites on the support or influencing metal&#8208;support interactions when using supported metal nanoparticles. This study focuses on CO2 hydrogenation over supported Cu nanoparticles, revealing a 3&#8208;fold increase in methanol yield when replacing oxygen anions with hydrides in the perovskite support (Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 yields &#8764;146 mg/h/gCu vs. Cu/BaTiO3 yields &#8764;50 mg/h/gCu). The contrast suggests significant roles of the support hydrides played in the reaction. Temperature programmed reaction and isotopic labelling studies indicate that BaTiO2.8H0.2 surface hydride species follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism in CO2 hydrogenation, promoting methanol production. High&#8208;pressure steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) studies suggest that Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 possesses both a higher density and more active and selective sites for methanol production compared to Cu/BaTiO3. Operando high&#8208;pressure diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8208;SSITKA study shows that formate species are the major surface intermediates over both catalysts, and the subsequent hydrogenation steps of formate are likely rate&#8208;limiting. But the catalytic reactivity of Cu/BaTiO2.8H0.2 towards the formate species is much higher than Cu/BaTiO3, likely due to the altered electronic structure of interface Cu sites by the hydrides in the support as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;Based Gene Editing System for Efficient Gene Therapy in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanostructures have played an important role in the development of novel drug delivery systems. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for efficient gene therapy in vivo. In our design, a PAM&#8208;rich region precisely organized on the surface of DNA origami can easily recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization. After loading the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, the DNA origami can be further rolled up by the locking strands with a disulfide bond. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, the cargo&#8208;loaded DNA origami can realize the targeted delivery and effective endosomal escape. After reduction by GSH, the opened DNA origami can release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex by RNase H cleavage to achieve a pronounced gene editing of a tumor&#8208;associated gene for gene therapy in vivo. This rationally developed DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system presents a new avenue for the development of gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled enantioselective desymmetrization of a novel dibromocyclobutene facilitates access to a versatile cyclobutene intermediate that can be functionalized to access a wide range of chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes and cyclobutanes.







Abstract
Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into various saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2&#8208;dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni&#8208;catalyzed photoredox C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono&#8208;coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.

         <title>Green Ether Electrolytes for Sustainable High&#8208;voltage Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green ether solvent is reported through a rational design of carbon chain regulation that tunes steric hindrance for an efficient solvation structure. Such a structure significantly reducing the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity, and the tuned solvation structure results in sustainable high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64&#8201;%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Uniform Colloidal Polymer Rods by Stabilizer&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform colloidal polymer rods/disks with tunable aspect ratios and well&#8208;defined internal molecular packing and orientations were successfully achieved from homopolymers or random copolymers by stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. They show an unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying memory effect, which have been used for high&#8208;level encryption and secure delivery of paper documents.







Abstract
The synthesis of anisotropic colloidal building blocks is essential for their self&#8208;assembly into hierarchical materials. Here, a highly efficient stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (SA&#8208;LCDSA) strategy was developed to achieve monodisperse colloidal polymer rods. This strategy does not require the use of block copolymers, but only homopolymers or random copolymers. The resulting rods have tunable size and aspect ratios, as well as well&#8208;defined columnar liquid crystal structures. The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA&#8208;LCDSA&#8208;based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;&#8208;molecular units.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation between selenonium salts and selenides can be easily achieved by adding alkylation reagents to the selenide compounds. By incorporating selenonium salts into polyurethane networks, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as solvent and creep resistance at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation by 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene was developed using persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron oxidizing reagent. Regioselective hydroxyalkenylation was observed for a variety of substituted alkenes. A photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation using an acridinium salt was also successful.







Abstract
We report a protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation. Using a persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation reagent and 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene as a radical acceptor in the presence of water, alkenes were converted into the corresponding 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyalkenes in good to high yields. The hydroxyalkenylation process involves the nucleophilic hydroxylation of alkene radical cations to give &#946;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals, which, after a radical addition/&#946;&#8208;elimination sequence, provide the products. We also report a photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation.

     alt="Electron-Transfer Protocol for the Hydroxyalkenylation of Alkenes Using 1,2-Bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation by 1,2-bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene was developed using persulfate anion as a one-electron oxidizing reagent. Regioselective hydroxyalkenylation was observed for a variety of substituted alkenes. A photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation using an acridinium salt was also successful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We report a protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation. Using a persulfate anion as a one-electron-oxidation reagent and 1,2-bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene as a radical acceptor in the presence of water, alkenes were converted into the corresponding 1-phenylsulfonyl-4-hydroxyalkenes in good to high yields. The hydroxyalkenylation process involves the nucleophilic hydroxylation of alkene radical cations to give &#946;-hydroxyalkyl radicals, which, after a radical addition/&#946;-elimination sequence, provide the products. We also report a photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymers, like covalent organic frameworks, are promising materials for a wide variety of applications. However, unlike conventional polymers, they are challenging to mold, shape, or process. Here we show how insoluble COFs, functionalized with oligoether sidechains, can be solution cast into high&#8208;dielectric films, with excellent flexibility and mechanical strength.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young's modulus of 391.7&#8197;MPa and 1034.7&#8197;MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed&#8208;valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN&#8208;doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8722; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of a forbidden transition (&#916;ms=&#177;2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;&#8208;trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable&#8208;temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties.

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayer was constructed on Pd nanoparticles in air at only 400&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting catalyst with non&#8208;metal active sites exhibited an exceptional resistance to poisoning by SO2 and H2O, yielding robust CO oxidation performance under 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O at temperatures as low as 120&#8201;&#176;C for at least 240&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21&#8197;vol&#8201;% O2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8208;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8722;S) bonding.

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoaffinity labeling has been a staple of chemical biology for the capture of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Through conjugation of a trifluorinated 7&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photo&#8208;crosslinking of glycan&#8208;protein interactions. This strategy and these &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; enable traceable photoaffinity labeling and could prove uniquely valuable for imaging biological recognition of glycans.







Abstract
Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.

We report a fluorinated azido-coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;-fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan-protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro-crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non-covalent binding events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal ions docked to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.







Abstract
Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8211;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Multiblock 1D Supramolecular Copolymers of Ir(III) Complexes with Controllable Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent supramolecular block copolymers (BCPs) have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities, but examples of three&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs are rare. Herein, we report the synthesis of three&#8208;component multiblock 1D supramolecular copolymers of Ir(III) complexes 1&#8208;3 via a sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization approach. Precise control on the kinetically trapped species via the pathway complexity of monomers is the key to the successful synthesis of BCPs with up to 9 blocks. Furthermore, 5&#8208;block BCPs with different sequences could be synthesized by changing the addition order of kinetic species during a sequentially seeded process. The corresponding heterogeneous nucleation&#8208;elongation process has been confirmed by UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra, and each segment of multiblock copolymers could be characterized by both TEM and SEM. Interestingly, the energy transfer leads to weakened emission of&#160;1&#8208;terminated and enhanced emission of&#160;3&#8208;terminated BCPs, respectively. This study will be an important step in advancing the synthesis and properties of three&#8208;component BCPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and their divergent further transformations have been established. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized. The intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage was supported by DFT calculations in both catalytic systems.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. Density functional theory calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Enones via Chloroacylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (enones) and esters. Regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides and chloroformates takes place under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.







Abstract
Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.

         <title>Toward De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst Candidates for Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reactions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to discover new catalysts: We grow a reaction network for each catalyst template (Ci) and look for catalytic activity in each reaction network. The reactant (R) reacts with the catalyst template (Ci) and forms several intermediates (Ii) before reaching a product (P) with the catalyst template regenerated.







Abstract
Recently we have demonstrated how a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from random tertiary amines can be used to discover a new and efficient catalyst for the alcohol&#8208;mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction. In particular, the discovered catalyst was shown experimentally to be eight times more active than DABCO, commonly used to catalyze the MBH reaction. This represents a breakthrough in using generative models for catalyst optimization. However, the GA procedure, and hence discovery, relied on two important pieces of information; 1)&#8197;the knowledge that tertiary amines catalyze the reaction and 2)&#8197;the mechanism and reaction profile for the catalyzed reaction, in particular the transition state structure of the rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, truly de novo catalyst discovery must include these steps. Here we present such a method for discovering catalyst candidates for a specific reaction while simultaneously proposing a mechanism for the catalyzed reaction. We show that tertiary amines and phosphines are potential catalysts for the MBH reaction by screening 11 molecular templates representing common functional groups. The method relies on an automated reaction discovery workflow using meta&#8208;dynamics calculations. Combining this method for catalyst candidate discovery with our GA&#8208;based catalyst optimization method results in an algorithm for truly de novo catalyst discovery.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via matching S cathodes in aqueous Cu2+ ion&#8208;based electrolyte and Li anodes in organic electrolyte. The Li||S hybrid batteries deliver a high discharge voltage and satisfactory capacity, contributing to incredible energy density.







Abstract
Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4&#8197;V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic increase in the bulkiness of dye substituents revealed an unexpected thermodynamic stability of face&#8208;to&#8208;face (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions during supramolecular polymerization. Our results contribute to the development of functional supramolecular polymers by controlling dye&#8208;dye interactions through molecular design.







Abstract
The functionalization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.

         <dc:description>
A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem &#947;&#8208;methylene C&#8722;H arylation and lactonization of aliphatic acids was enabled by a L,X&#8208;type CarboxPyridone ligand. A wide range of &#947;&#8208;arylated &#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones are synthesized in a single step from aliphatic acids in moderate to good yield. Arylated lactones can readily be converted into disubstituted tetrahydrofurans, a prominent scaffold amongst bioactive molecules.

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X&#8208;ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H2O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PanH, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was identified and verified as the enzyme responsible for epoxycyclohexenone formation in panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis. A PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst enabled an enzymatic approach to synthesize a library of bioactive epoxycyclohexenone compounds.







Abstract
An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i)&#8197;identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii)&#8197;biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.

Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH-forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coding Intrinsic Disorder into DNA Hybridization Probes Enables Discrimination of Single Nucleotide Variants over Wide and Tunable Temperature Ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Classic hybridization probes for discriminating single nucleotide mutations typically work at elevated temperatures and in very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T) due to the high entropy penalty. By adding intrinsic disorder into hybridization probes, we successfully expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#916;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#916;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, both &#916;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36&#8197;pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100&#8201;% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach towards enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of Bi&#8208;based catalysts was demonstrated via the L&#8208;histidine incorporation. The improved CO2 chemical adsorption and electron&#8208;rich nature of resultant catalysts enables high Faradaic efficiency for formate production in an ultra&#8208;wide potential window even with low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding. (TETA and DEA refer to triethylenetetramine and diethanolamine, respectively).







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt;90&#8201;% within &#8722;0.1&#8211;&#8722;1.8&#8197;V and &gt;95&#8201;% within &#8722;0.2&#8211;&#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20&#8197;vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8722;0.02&#8197;VRHE) was detected by in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements, together with stable operation over 50&#8197;h with preserved FEformate of &#8776;95&#8201;% and high partial current density of 326.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE.

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method has been developed for installing stable polyradicals into polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, as illustrated by the formation of an air&#8208;stable, high&#8208;spin carbon&#8208;based diradical with a new ferromagnetic coupling motif of diazapyrene. The structure of the diradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, while the magnetic measurements provided unambiguous evidence for the high&#8208;spin ground state and a long spin relaxation process.







Abstract
Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif synthesized by a convenient method that allows the integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles has been developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing a triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2&#8776;31&#8197;h) in air. Compared to the widely used 1,3&#8208;phenylene, the newly designed (diaza)pyrene&#8208;4,10&#8208;diyl moiety is for the first time demonstrated to confer ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling, allowing delocalized non&#8208;disjoint SOMOs. With the X&#8208;ray crystallography unambiguously proving the diradical structure, the triplet ground state was thoroughly characterized. A large &#916;ES&#8208;T of 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol, proving the strong FM coupling effect, was revealed consistently by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while the zero&#8208;field splitting and triplet nutation characters were examined by continuous&#8208;wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy. A millisecond spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time was also detected. The current study not only offers a new molecular motif enabling FM coupling between carbon&#8208;based spins, but more importantly presents a general method for installing stable polyradicals into functional &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular customization strategy was applied for efficient MOF membrane fabrication. MOF material screening, defect&#8208;free membrane output, membrane physicochemical property regulation and separation applications can be rapidly realized by separately designing and modifying the MOF module within the membrane. High separation performance is easily achieved, which can meet diverse separation requirements.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H2 permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.

     alt="Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modular customization strategy was applied for efficient MOF membrane fabrication. MOF material screening, defect-free membrane output, membrane physicochemical property regulation and separation applications can be rapidly realized by separately designing and modifying the MOF module within the membrane. High separation performance is easily achieved, which can meet diverse separation requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy-efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long-standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect-free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non-destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full-chain demonstration for membrane fabrication-separation validation-microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphthyl Substituted Impurities Induce Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accidentally, it was found that triphenylamine (TPA) from commercial sources shows ultralong yellow&#8208;green room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) like commercial carbazole, which however disappears for lab&#8208;synthesized TPA with high purity. Herein, we for the first time identify the impurity types that cause RTP of commercial TPA, which are two N, N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;naphthylamine isomers. Due to similar molecular polarity and very trace amount (~0.8&#8240;, molar ratio), these naphthyl substituted impurities can be easily overlooked. We further show that even at an extremely low amount (1000000:1, mass ratio) of impurities, RTP emission is still generated, attributed to the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism. Notably, this doping strategy is also applicable to the triphenylphosphine and benzophenone host systems, of which strong RTP emission can be activated by simply doping the corresponding naphthyl substituted analogues into them. This work therefore provides a general and efficient host/guest strategy toward high performance and diverse organic RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Parallel Planar Heterojunction Strategy Enables Sb2S3 Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 8%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on inorganic heterojunctions provide a potential approach to the efficient, stable and low&#8208;cost solar cells required for the terrestrial generation of photovoltaic energy. Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber. Here, an easily solution&#8208;processed parallel planar heterojunction (PPHJ) strategy and related principle are developed to prepare efficient multiple planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells, and the PPHJ strategy boosts the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed Sb2S3 solar cells up to 8.32% that is the highest amongst Sb2S3 devices. The Sb2S3&#8208;based PPHJ device consists of two kinds of conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ) subcells in a parallel connection: Sb2S3&#8208;based PHJ subcells dominating the absorption and charge generation and CH3NH3PbI3&#8208;based PHJ subcells governing the electron transport towards collection electrode, but it belongs to an Sb2S3 device in nature. The resulting PPHJ device combines together the distinctive structural features of Sb2S3 absorbing layer as a main absorber and the duplexity of well&#8208;crystallized/oriented CH3NH3PbI3 layer in charge transportation as an additional absorber, while the presence of perovskite does not affect device stability. The PPHJ strategy maintains the feasible preparation by the conventional sequential depositions of multiple layers, but eliminates the normal complexity in both tandem and parallel tandem PHJ systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Imaging of RNA&#8208;Tau Amyloid Fibrils at the Nanoscale Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the presence of cofactors, tau protein can form amyloid deposits in the brain which are implicated in many neurodegenerative disorders. Heparin, lipids, and RNA are used to recreate tau aggregates in vitro from recombinant protein. However, the mechanism of interaction of these cofactors and the interactions between cofactors and tau are poorly understood. Herein, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the spatial distribution of adenine, protein secondary structure, and amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine) in single poly&#8208;adenosine (polyA) &#8208;induced tau fibrils with nanoscale spatial resolution (&lt; 10&#8208;20 nm). Based on reference unenhanced and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra, we show that the polyA anionic cofactor is incorporated in the fibril structure and seems to be superficial to the &#946;&#8208;sheet core, but nonetheless enveloped within the random&#8208;coiled fuzzy coat. TERS images also prove the colocalization of positively charged arginine, lysine, and histidine amino acids and negatively charged polyA, which constitutes an important step forward to better comprehend the action of RNA cofactors in the mechanism of formation of toxic tau fibrils. TERS appears as a powerful technique for the identification of cofactors in individual tau fibrils and their mode of interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturarion Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) method for the detection of water cycling across cellular membranes.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water cycling across the membrane transporters is considered a hallmark of cellular metabolism and it could be of high diagnostic relevance in the characterization of tumors and other diseases. The method relies on the response of intracellular proton exchanging molecules to the presence of extracellular Gd&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs). Paramagnetic GBCAs enhances the relaxation rate of water molecules in the extracellular compartment and, through membrane exchange, the relaxation enhancement is transferred to intracellular molecules. The effect is detected at the MRI&#8208;CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on RBC and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN). The distribution of voxels reporting on membrane permeability fits well with the cells&#8217; aggressiveness and act as an early reporter to monitor therapeutic treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of the Core Chemistry of Self&#8208;Assembled Spherical Nucleic Acids on their In Vitro Fate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs), such as mRNA, small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides are extremely efficient tools to modulate gene expressions and tackle otherwise undruggable diseases. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) can efficiently deliver small NATs to cells while protecting their payload from nucleases, have improved biodistribution and muted immune activation. Self&#8208; assembled SNAs have emerged as nanostructures made from a single DNA&#8208;polymer conjugate with similar favorable properties as well as small molecule encapsulation. However, because they maintain their structure by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might suffer from disassembly in biologically relevant conditions, especially with regards to their interaction with serum proteins. Here, we report a systematic study of the factors that govern the fate of self&#8208;assembled SNAs. Varying the core chemistry and using stimuli&#8208;responsive disulfide crosslinking, we show that extracellular stability upon binding with serum proteins is important for recognition by membrane receptors, triggering cellular uptake. At the same time, intracellular dissociation is required for efficient therapeutic release. Disulfide&#8208; crosslinked SNAs combine these two properties and result in efficient and non&#8208;toxic unaided gene silencing therapeutics. We anticipate these investigations will help the translation of promising self&#8208; assembled structures towards&#160;in vivo&#160;gene silencing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Glutathione Mediates Control of Dual Differential Bio&#8208;orthogonal Labelling of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional approaches to bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction discovery have focused on developing reagent pairs that react faster with each other than their metabolic degradation. Glutathione (GSH) is typically responsible for the deactivation of most bio&#8208;orthogonal reagents. Here we demonstrate that GSH promotes a Cu&#8208;catalysed (3+2) cycloaddition reaction between an ynamine and an azide. We show that GSH acts as a redox modulator to control the Cu oxidation state in these cycloadditions. Rate enhancement of this reaction is specific for ynamine substrates and is tuneable by the Cu:GSH ratio. This unique GSH&#8208;mediated reactivity gradient is then utilised in the dual sequential bio&#8208;orthogonal labelling of peptides and oligonucleotides via two distinct chemoselective (3+2) cycloadditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Nitridoborates, Nitrides and Hydrides &#8211; Synthesis and Characterization of the Multianionic Sr6N[BN2]2H3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multianionic metal hydrides, which exhibit a wide variety of physical properties and complex structures, have recently attracted growing interest. Here we present Sr6N[BN2]2H3, prepared in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction at 800&#160;&#176;C, as the first combination of nitridoborate, nitride and hydride anions within a single compound. The crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data in space group P21/c (no. 14), revealing a three&#8208;dimensional network of undulated layers of nitridoborate units, strontium atoms and hydride together with nitride anions. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations further confirm the structure model. Electrochemical measurements suggest the existence of hydride ion conductivity, allowing the hydrides to migrate along the layers.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Termination on Unstable Methylammonium&#8208;based Perovskite Using a Steric Barrier for Improved Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to widely adopted low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterostructure, functional organic cation based surface termination on perovskite can not only realize advantage of defect passivation but also prevent potential disadvantage of the heterostructure induced intercalation into 3D perovskite. However, it is still very challenging to controllably construct surface termination on organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite because the functional organic cations&#8217; substitution reaction is easy to form LD/3D heterostructure. Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5&#8208;dimensional perovskite of BTA4Pb3I10 by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10 minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI3 films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 shows better passivation effect than BTA4Pb3I10&#8208;MAPbI3 heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085 cm2) and mini&#8208;module (11.52 cm2) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03% and 18.57%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI3 based ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;activated Assembly of DNA Origami into Dissipative Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical DNA nanostructures offer programmable functions at scale, but making these structures dynamic, while keeping individual components intact, is challenging. Here we show that the DNA A&#8208;motif &#8211; protonated, self&#8208;complementary poly(adenine) sequences &#8211; can propagate DNA origami into one&#8208;dimensional, micron&#8208;length fibrils. When coupled to a small molecule pH regulator, visible light can activate the hierarchical assembly of our DNA origami into dissipative fibrils. This system is recyclable and does not require DNA modification. By employing a modular and waste&#8208;free strategy to assemble and disassemble hierarchical structures built from DNA origami, we offer a facile and accessible route to developing well&#8208;defined, dynamic, and large DNA assemblies with temporal control. As a general tool, we envision that coupling the A&#8208;motif to cycles of dissipative protonation will allow the transient construction of diverse DNA nanostructures, finding broad applications in dynamic and non&#8208;equilibrium nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>A NIR Programmable In Vivo miRNA Magnifier for NIR&#8208;II Imaging of Early Stage Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aberrant expressions of biomolecules occur much earlier than tumor visualized size and morphology change, but their common measurement strategies such as biopsy suffer from invasive sampling process. In vivo imaging of slight biomolecule expression difference is urgently needed for early cancer detection. Fluorescence of rare earth nanoparticles (RENPs) in second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region makes them appropriate tool for in vivo imaging. However, the incapacity to couple with signal amplification strategies, especially programmable signal amplification strategies, limited their application in lowly expressed biomarkers imaging. Here we develop a 980/808 nm NIR programmed in vivo microRNAs (miRNAs) magnifier by conjugating activatable DNAzyme walker set to RENPs, which achieves more effective NIR&#8208;II imaging of early stage tumor than size monitoring imaging technique. Dye FD1080 (FD1080) modified substrate DNA quenches NIR&#8208;II downconversion emission of RENPs under 808 nm excitation. The miRNA recognition region in DNAzyme walker is sealed by a photo&#8208;cleavable strand to avoid &#8220;false positive&#8221; signal in systemic circulation. Upconversion emission of RENPs under 980 nm irradiation activates DNAzyme walker for miRNA recognition and amplifies NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery of RENPs via DNAzyme catalytic reaction to achieve in vivo miRNA imaging. This strategy demonstrates good application potential in the field of early cancer detection.</dc:description>

         <title>A Subtle Change in the Flexible Achiral Spacer Does Matter in Supramolecular Chirality: Two&#8208;Fold Odd&#8208;Even Effect in Polymer Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over the chirality and morphologies of polymer assemblies, a remaining challenge for both chemists and materials scientists, is receiving ever&#8208;increasing attention in the recent years. Herein, we report the subtle manipulation of the achiral spacers from the chiral stereocenter to the azobenzene (Azo) unit, of which the chiroptical consistency or chiroptical inversion of self&#8208;assemblies could be successfully controlled and present &#8220;two&#8208;fold&#8221; odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, morphological transitions from 0D spherical micelles, 1D worms, and nanowires to 3D vesicles, spindle&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped vesicles were also unexpectedly found to exhibit odd&#8208;even correlations. These observations were collectively elucidated by mesomorphic properties, stacking modes, chiroptical dynamics, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. Negligible modifications to the spacer structures can enable remarkable modulation of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topologies in polymer assemblies, which is of great significance for the design of complex chiral functional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>T Cell Antigen Recognition and Discrimination by Electrochemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adoptive T lymphocyte (T cell) transfer and tumour&#8208;specific peptide vaccines&#160;are innovative cancer therapies. An accurate assessment of the specific reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to tumour antigens is required because of the high heterogeneity of tumour cells and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. In this study, we report a label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour&#8208;specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour&#8208;specific antigens, were modified on the electrode&#8217;s surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adoptive T lymphocyte (T cell) transfer and tumour-specific peptide vaccines&#160;are innovative cancer therapies. An accurate assessment of the specific reactivity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to tumour antigens is required because of the high heterogeneity of tumour cells and the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. In this study, we report a label-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging approach for recognising and discriminating between TCRs and tumour-specific antigens by imaging the immune synapses of T cells. Various T cell stimuli, including agonistic antibodies, auxiliary molecules, and tumour-specific antigens, were modified on the electrode&#8217;s surface to allow for their interaction with T cells bearing different TCRs. The formation of immune synapses activated by specific stimuli produced a negative (shadow) ECL image, from which T cell antigen recognition and discrimination were evaluated by analysing the spreading area and the recognition intensity of T cells. This approach provides an easy way to assess TCR-antigen specificity and screen both of them for immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Peptides ADP&#8208;ribosylated at Histidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transfer of an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose moiety to a nucleophilic side chain by consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is referred to as ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which allows for the spatiotemporal regulation of vital processes such as apoptosis and DNA repair. Recent mass&#8208;spectrometry based analyses of the &#8216;ADP&#8208;ribosylome&#8217; have identified histidine as ADP&#8208;ribose acceptor site. In order to study this modification, a fully synthetic strategy towards &#945;&#8208;configured N(&#964;)&#8208; and N(&#960;)&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated histidine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed. Ribofuranosylated histidine building blocks were obtained via Mukaiyama&#8208;type glycosylation and the building blocks were integrated into an ADP&#8208;ribosylome derived peptide sequence using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. On&#8208;resin installation of the ADP moiety was achieved using phosphoramidite chemistry, and global deprotection provided the desired ADP&#8208;ribosylated oligopeptides. The stability under various chemical conditions and resistance against (ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase&#8208;mediated degradation has been investigated to reveal that the constructs are stable under various chemical conditions and non&#8208;degradable by any of the known ADP&#8208;ribosylhydrolases.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes Enabling Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superionic solid electrolytes (SEs) are essential for bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) applications. Multicomponent SEs are recently attracting attention for their favorable charge&#8208;transport properties, however a thorough understanding of how configurational entropy (&#916;Sconf) affects ionic conductivity is lacking. Here, we successfully synthesized a series of halogen&#8208;rich lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li5.5PS4.5ClxBr1.5&#8722;x (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.5). Using neutron powder diffraction and 31P magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the S2&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; occupancy on the anion sublattice was quantitatively analyzed. We show that disorder positively affects Li&#8208;ion dynamics, leading to a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 22.7 mS cm&#8722;1 (9.6 mS cm&#8722;1 in cold&#8208;pressed state) for Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 (&#916;Sconf = 1.98R). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that configurational entropy of the anion sublattice correlates with ion mobility. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors by tailoring the degree of compositional complexity. Moreover, the Li5.5PS4.5Cl0.8Br0.7 SE allowed for stable cycling of single crystal LiNi0.9Co0.06Mn0.04O2 (s&#8208;NCM90) composite cathodes in SSB cells, underscoring the unique opportunity to achieve both high ionic conductivity paired with (electro)chemical stability with dual&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Polyarenes by Catalytic C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanocarbons incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal aromatic rings &#8211; such as five&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings &#8211; have various intriguing physical properties such as curved structures, unique one&#8208;dimensional packing, and promising magnetic, optical, and conductivity properties. Herein, we report an efficient synthetic approach to polycyclic aromatics containing seven&#8208;membered rings via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Ar&#8211;H/Ar&#8211;Br coupling. In addition to all&#8208;hydrocarbon scaffolds, heteroatom&#8208;embedded heptagon&#8208;containing polyarenes can be efficiently constructed with this method. Rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered ring formations also afford complex heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons from readily available arylacetylenes and biphenyl boronic acids. Detailed mechanistic analysis by DFT calculations showed the feasibility of seven&#8208;membered ring formation by a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism. This reaction can serve as a template for the synthesis of a wide range of seven&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Reduction&#160;to Ethylene Mediated by Adaptive Small&#8208;molecule Engineering of Copper&#8208;based Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu catalysts exhibits enormous potential for efficiently converting CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). However, achieving high C2H4 selectivity remains a considerable challenge due to the propensity of Cu catalysts to undergo structural reconstruction during CO2RR. Herein, we report an in situ molecule modification strategy that involves tannic acid (TA) molecules adaptive regulating the reconstruction of a Cu&#8208;based material to a pathway that facilitates CO2 reduction to C2H4 products. An excellent Faraday efficiency (FE) of 63.6% on C2H4 with a current density of 497.2 mA cm&#8208;2 in flow cell was achieved, about 6.5 times higher than the pristine Cu catalyst which mainly produce CH4. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman studies reveal that the hydroxyl group in TA stabilizes Cu&#948;+ during the CO2RR. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrate that the partially oxidized Cu&#948;+/Cu0 interfaces lower the activation energy barrier for *CO dimerization, and hydroxyl species stabilize the *COH intermediate via hydrogen bonding, thereby promoting C2H4 production. Such molecule engineering modulated electronic structure provides a promising strategy to achieve highly selective CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Enantiomer Emitter Enabled Superstructural Helix Inversion for Upconverting and Downshifting Luminescence with Bidirectional Circular Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The helical twisting tendency of liquid crystals (LCs) is generally governed by the inherent configuration of the chiral emitter. Here, we introduce the multistage inversion of supramolecular chirality as well as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by manipulating the ratio of single enantiomeric emitters (R&#8208;PCP) to LC monomers (5CB). Increasing the content of R&#8208;PCP from 1 wt% to 3 wt% inverted the helix of LCs from left&#8208;handed to right&#8208;handed, accompanying a CPL sign changed from positive to negative. The biaxiality of chiral emitters, as well as the steric effect of chiral&#8208;chiral and chiral&#8208;achiral interaction, were identified as the reasons for helical sense inversion. Due to the strong helical twisting power, 4 wt% R&#8208;PCP drove the photonic bandgap (PBG) of chiral LCs to match up with their emission range, leading to an inversion of the CPL again with a high dissymmetry factor (~1.2). Directly adjusting the PBG using chiral emitters is seldom achieved in cholesteric LCs. On this basis, an achiral sensitizer PtTPBP was assembled into the helical superstructure. The generation of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;induced upconverted CPL from R&#8208;PCP and the downshifting CPL from PtTPBP with opposite rotation was achieved in a single chiral LC system by tuning the position of the PBG.</dc:description>

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Michelle Arkin and Adam Renslo from the University of California, San Francisco in the USA and Luc Brunsveld and Christian Ottmann from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. They recently published an article on designing molecular glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/estrogen receptor (ER) protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI). Molecular glues increase the binding between two proteins by binding at the PPI interface. While they hold exciting promise to induce new biology and treat disease, systematic approaches to discover glues are just becoming available. Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery has been used to discover inhibitors of PPI; here, the team demonstrated a fragment discovery and linking strategy to create a new molecular glue for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER, an anticancer target. &#8220;From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions though Fragment Linking&#8221;, E.&#8197;J.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Jiaxiang Chu at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (China) and Dominik Munz at Saarland University (Germany). They recently reported isocyanide homologation mediated by aluminium(I) as a Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model reaction. Up to five molecules were coupled, and the step&#8208;by&#8208;step mechanism was elucidated. Combined mechanistic/computational work provided evidence that carbenes are the key intermediates during this process. &#8220;Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)&#8221;, C.&#8197;J.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of various oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes (PC, PET, PBT, and PPO) to cycloalkanes as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is reported by Sibao Liu, Guozhu Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310505). The collected oxyen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes such as bottles, key boards, cloth fibers, etc., are first sorted and washed by machine to ensure that these plastic wastes are pure enough to be chemically recycled. Then the sorted plastic wastes or their mixture are processed by HDO reaction over a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM&#8208;5.

         <title>Non&#8208;interacted Ni and Fe Dual&#8208;atom Pair Sites in N&#8208;doped Carbon Catalysts for Efficient Concentrating Solar&#8208;driven Photothermal CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion under weak solar irradiation is generally difficult to meet the heat demand of CO2 reduction. Herein, a new concentrated solar&#8208;driven photothermal system coupling a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst (DSAC) with adjacent Ni&#8208;N4 and Fe&#8208;N4 pair sites is designed for boosting gas&#8208;solid CO2 reduction with H2O under simulated solar irradiation even ambient sunlight. As expected, the (Ni, Fe)&#8208;N&#8208;C DSAC exhibits a superior photothermal catalytic performance for CO2 reduction to main CO (86.16 &#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), CH4 (135.35 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and CH3OH (59.81 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) productions, which are equivalent to 1.70&#8208;fold, 1.27&#8208;fold and 1.23&#8208;fold higher than those of&#160; Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst, respectively. Based on theoretical simulations, the Fermi level and d&#8208;band center of Fe atom is efficiently regulated in non&#8208;interacted Ni and Fe dual&#8208;atom pair sites with electronic interaction through electron orbital hybridization on (Ni, Fe)&#8208;N&#8208;C DSAC. Crucially, the spatially proper distance between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;N&#8208;Fe configuration induces that the additional Ni atom as a new active site contribute to the main *COOH and *HCO3 dissociation to optimize the corresponding energy barriers in the reaction process, leading to specific dual reaction pathways (COOH and HCO3 pathways) for solar&#8208;driven photothermal CO2 reduction to initial CO production.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar-to-chemical energy conversion under weak solar irradiation is generally difficult to meet the heat demand of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Deconstructable and Chemically Recyclable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;Like Materials Based on Si&#8211;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced synthetic polymer. By installing chemically cleavable bonds into the backbone of PE, it is possible to produce chemically deconstructable PE derivatives; to date, however, such designs have primarily relied on carbonyl&#8208; and olefin&#8208;related functional groups. Bifunctional silyl ethers (BSEs; SiR2(OR&#8217;2)) could expand the functional scope of PE mimics as they possess strong Si&#8211;O bonds, excellent oxidative stabilities, and facile chemical tunability. Here, we report BSE&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials synthesized through a one&#8208;pot catalytic ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and hydrogenation sequence. The crystallinity of these materials can be adjusted by varying the BSE concentration or the steric bulk of the Si&#8208;substituents, providing handles to control thermomechanical properties while maintaining the high thermal stability of HDPE. Two methods for chemical recycling of HDPE mimics are introduced, including a circular approach that leverages acid&#8208;catalyzed Si&#8211;O bond exchange with 1&#8208;propanol. Additionally, despite the fact that the starting HDPE mimics were synthesized by chain&#8208;growth polymerization (ROMP), we show that it is possible to recover the molar mass and dispersity of recycled HDPE products using step&#8208;growth Si&#8211;O bond formation or exchange, generating high molecular weight recycled HDPE products with mechanical properties similar to commercial HDPE.</dc:description>

Additionally, despite the fact that the starting HDPE mimics were synthesized by chain-growth polymerization (ROMP), we show that it is possible to recover the molar mass and dispersity of recycled HDPE products using step-growth Si&#8211;O bond formation or exchange, generating high molecular weight recycled HDPE products with mechanical properties similar to commercial HDPE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Colorimetric Biosensing Platform with Aptamers, Rolling Circle Amplification and Urease&#8208;Mediated Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and the high efficiency of a&#160;simple urease&#8208;mediated litmus test.&#160;&#160;The presence of a&#160;target triggers the RCA reaction, and urease&#8208;labelled DNA can hybridize to the biotinylated RCA products and be&#160;immobilized onto streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads. The urease&#8208;laden beads are then used to hydrolyze urea, leading to an increase in pH that can be detected by a simple litmus test. We show this sensing platform can be easily integrated with aptamers for sensing diverse targets via the detection of human thrombin and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) utilizing structure&#8208;switching aptamers as well as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva using a spike&#8208;binding trimeric DNA aptamer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this colorimetric sensing platform can be integrated into a simple paper&#8208;based device for sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Arrhenius Na&#8208;ion Conductivity in Na3OBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sodium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (NaRAPs) with composition Na3OB (B = Br, Cl, I, BH4, etc.) are a family of materials that has recently attracted great interest for application as solid electrolytes in sodium metal batteries. Non&#8208;Arrhenius ionic conductivities have been reported for these materials, the origin of which is poorly understood. In this work, we combined temperature&#8208;resolved bulk and local characterisation methods to gain an insight into the origin of this unusual behaviour using Na3OBr as a model system. We first excluded crystallographic disorder on the anion sites as the cause of the change in activation energy; then identified the presence of a poorly crystalline impurities, not detectable by XRD, and elucidated their effect on ionic conductivity. These findings improve understanding of the processing&#8208;structure&#8208;properties relationships pertaining to NaRAPs and highlight the need to determine those relationships in other materials systems, which will accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Dual&#8208;Network Cellulosic Composite Bioplastic Metafilm for Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the escalating environmental and health concerns over petroleum&#8208;based plastics, sustainable and biodegradable cellulosic materials are a promising alternative to plastics, yet remain unsatisfied properties such as fragility, inflammability and water sensitivity for practical usage. Herein, we present a novel dual&#8208;network design strategy to address these limitations and fabricate a high&#8208;performance cellulosic composite bioplastic metafilm with exceptional mechanical toughness (23.5 MJ&#183;m&#8208;3), flame retardance, and solvent resistance by in&#8208;situ growth of cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;bridged organosilica network within bacterial cellulose matrix. The phosphorus, nitrogen&#8208;containing organosilica network, verified by the experimental and theoretical results, plays a triple action on significantly enhancing tensile strength, toughness, flame retardance and water resistance of composite bioplastic metafilm. Furthermore, cellulosic bioplastic composite metafilm demonstrates a higher maximum usage temperature (245 &#176;C), lower thermal expansion coefficient (15.19 ppm&#183;&#176;C&#8208;1), and better solvent resistance than traditional plastics, good biocompatibility and natural biodegradation. Moreover, composite bioplastic metafilm have a good transparency of average 74% and a high haze over 80%, which can serve as an outstanding substrate substitute for commercial polyethylene terephthalate film to address the demand of flexible ITO films. This work paves a creative way to design and manufacture the competitive bioplastic composite to replace daily&#8208;used plastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments with Organogermanes: their Preparation and Application in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the sphere of traditional Pd0/PdII cross coupling reactions, organogermanes have been historically outperformed both in terms of scope and reactivity by more conventional transmetalating reagents. Subsequently, this class of compounds has been largely underutilized as a coupling partner in bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most recent studies, however, have shown that alternative modes of activation of these notoriously robust building blocks transform organogermanes into the most reactive site of the molecule &#8211; capable of outcompeting other functional groups (such as boronic acids, esters and silanes) for both C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation. As a result, over the past few years, the literature has increasingly featured methodologies that explore the potential of organogermanes as chemoselective and orthogonal coupling partners. Herein we highlight some of these recent advances in the field of organogermane chemistry both with respect to their synthesis and applications in synthetic and catalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycan Metabolic Fluorine Labeling for In Vivo Visualization of Tumor Cells and In Situ Assessment of Glycosylation Variations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The abnormality in the glycosylation of surface proteins is critical for the growth and metastasis of tumors and their capacity for immunosuppression and drug resistance. This anomaly offers an entry point for real&#8208;time analysis on glycosylation fluctuations. In this study, we report a strategy, glycan metabolic fluorine labeling (MEFLA), for selectively tagging glycans of tumor cells. As a proof of concept, we synthesized two fluorinated unnatural monosaccharides with distinctive 19F chemical shifts (Ac4ManNTfe and Ac4GalNTfa). These two probes could undergo selective uptake by tumor cells and subsequent incorporation into surface glycans. This approach enables efficient and specific 19F labeling of tumor cells, which permits in vivo tracking of tumor cells and in situ assessment of glycosylation changes by 19F MRI. The efficiency and specificity of our probes for labeling tumor cells were verified in vitro with A549 cells. The feasibility of our method was further validated with in vivo experiments on A549 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Moreover, the capacity of our approach for assessing glycosylation changes of tumor cells was illustrated both in vitro and in vivo. Our studies provide a promising means for visualizing tumor cells in vivo and assessing their glycosylation variations in situ through targeted multiplexed 19F MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoenzymatic Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Benzo&#8208;Fused Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis in organic synthesis has recently emerged as a green and powerful strategy for the preparation of valuable chiral products, among which chiral oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles are important structural motifs in pharmaceutical industry. However, the asymmetric synthesis of these compounds through radical&#8208;mediated methods is challenging. Herein, a novel asymmetric radical&#8208;mediated photoenzymatic synthesis strategy is developed to realize the efficient enantioselective synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles through structure&#8208;guided engineering of a flavin&#8208;dependent 'ene'&#8208;reductase GluER. It shows that variant GluER&#8208;W100H could efficiently produce various benzoxepinones, chromanone and indanone with different benzo&#8208;fused rings in high yields with great stereoselectivities under visible light. Moreover, these results are well supported by mechanistic experiments, revealing that this photoenzymatic process involves electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex formation, single electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. Therefore, we provide an alternative green approach for efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of important chiral skeletons of bioactive pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide a weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure&#8208;sensitive and structural adhesives. Formulations are water&#8208;based and form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low&#8208;energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio&#8208;based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water&#8208;based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large&#8208;scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling for Sustainable Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Application to the Synthesis of Allenic Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical Crabb&#233; type SN2&#180; substitutions of propargylic substrates has served as one of the standard methods for the synthesis of allenes. However, the stereospecific version of this transformation often requires either stoichiometric amounts organocopper reagents or special functional groups on the substrates, and the chirality transfer efficiency is also capricious. Herein, we report a sustainable methodology for the synthesis of diverse 1,3&#8208;di and tri&#8208;substituted allenes by using a simple and cheap cellulose supported heterogeneous nanocopper catalyst (MCC&#8208;Amp&#8208;Cu(I/II)). This approach represents the first example of heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of chiral allenes. High yields and excellent enantiospecificity (up to 97% yield, 99% ee) were achieved for a wide range of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted allenes bearing various functional groups. It is worth noting that the applied heterogeneous catalyst could be recycled at least 5 times without any reduced reactivity. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol, we have applied it to the total synthesis of several chiral allenic natural products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Anionic [Pd(0)&#8208;X]&#8208; ate complex were proposed as key intermediates in Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling for decades, but their isolation remained elusive. Herein, a chelating Lewis acidic bis(amidophenolato)silane is introduced as a strong Z&#8208;type ligand which enables the characterization of the first anionic [Pd(0)&#8208;X]&#8208; ate complex. Intriguingly, these compounds and the neutral L&#8208;Pd(0) analogs exhibit a square planar coordination that is highly unusual for a d10 metal. Theoretical methods scrutinize the interaction between the Lewis acidic Si(IV) center and the late transition metal, while reactivity studies shed light on the potential role of anionic additives in oxidative addition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Conformation of Dimeric Acceptors and Their Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimeric&#8208;type acceptors, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized with selenophone and thiophene as a bridge, respectively. Both exhibit O&#8208;shape conformation as determined by NMR and DFT simulations, which is driven by the robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of intramolecular terminal groups. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;DIBP3F&#8208;Se&#8208;based solar cell demonstrated an efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%.







Abstract
The determination of molecular conformations of oligomeric acceptors (OAs) and their impact on molecular packing are crucial for understanding the photovoltaic performance of their resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs) but have not been well studied yet. Herein, we synthesized two dimeric acceptor materials, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S, which bridged two segments of Y6&#8208;derivatives by selenophene and thiophene, respectively. Theoretical simulation and experimental 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic studies prove that both dimers exhibit O&#8208;shaped conformations other than S&#8208; or U&#8208;shaped counter&#8208;ones. Notably, this O&#8208;shaped conformation is likely governed by a distinctive &#8220;conformational lock&#8221; mechanism, arising from the intensified intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among their two terminal groups within the dimers. PSCs based on DIBP3F&#8208;Se deliver a maximum efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, outperforming DIBP3F&#8208;S&#8208;based cells (16.11&#8201;%) and ranking among the highest efficiencies for OA&#8208;based PSCs. This work demonstrates a facile method to obtain OA conformations and highlights the potential of dimeric acceptors for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Time&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Transformation (TTT) Diagram of Battery&#8208;Grade Li&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Sustainable Synthesis</title>

The establishment of a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirms stabilization of cubic&#8208;phase LLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Technologically, the newly proposed low&#8208;temperature processing routes benefit the integration and scale&#8208;up of LLZO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries at reduced costs and carbon footprint.







Abstract
Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.

Specifically, we establish a time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous-to-crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin-film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low-temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction, synthesized by crystal orientation control and heterostructure construction, shows unprecedented selectivity, activity, and stability for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination under ambient conditions. Using the presented protocol, a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxyl acids can be successfully converted into the corresponding amino acids.







Abstract
Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation to Formate over Edge&#8208;Sulfur Vacancies of Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edge&#8208;rich MoS2 is presented as a promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate with superior activity and stability. The selective formation of formate is enabled by using surface OH* and H* species from H2O dissociation on the edge&#8208;sulfur vacancies as moderate hydrogenating agents.







Abstract
Synthesis of formate from hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an atom&#8208;economic reaction but is confronted with challenges in developing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for application of the process. Herein, we report a highly durable edge&#8208;rich molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate at 200&#8201;&#176;C, which delivers a high selectivity of over 99&#8201;% with a superior turnover frequency of 780.7&#8197;h&#8722;1 surpassing those of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal catalysts. Multiple experimental characterization techniques combined with theoretical calculations reveal that sulfur vacancies at MoS2 edges are the active sites and the selective production of formate is enabled via a completely new water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation mechanism, in which surface OH* and H* species in dynamic equilibrium with water serve as moderate hydrogenating agents for CO2 with residual O* reduced by hydrogen. This study provides a new route for developing low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to formate.

         <title>Hydrogen Transport and Evolution in Ni&#8208;MH Batteries by Neutron Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;destructive and high&#8208;resolution methods allowing the investigation of battery systems are provided by operando neutron imaging combined with electrical monitoring of the state of charge. We track the exchange and transport of hydrogen in the electrodes and the evolution of hydrogen gas under operating conditions of a commercial Ni&#8208;mixed metal hydride battery.







Abstract
Efficiency losses due to side reactions are one of the main challenges in battery development. Despite providing valuable insights, the results of standard analysis on the individual components cannot be simply extrapolated to the full operating system. Therefore, non&#8208;destructive, and high resolution approaches that allow the investigation of the full system are desired. Herein, we combined neutron radiography and tomography with electrical monitoring of the state of charge of commercial Ni&#8208;mischmetal hydride batteries, to track the exchange and transport of hydrogen under operating conditions. This non&#8208;destructive approach allowed both the quantification of the hydrogen distribution in the electrodes in 4D, and the distinction between the electrochemically exchanged hydrogen and the hydrogen gas pressure generated by side reactions, as a function of the applied potential and current. One of the most counter&#8208;intuitive observation is that the generation of hydrogen gas during discharge depends on the charging state of the battery. The results presented provide critical new insights in the mechanisms governing the electrochemical processes during Nimischmetal hydride battery operation, and also pave the way for the extrapolation of this approach to the investigation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ions batteries.

A nucleotidoprotein engineered via facile &#8220;green synthesis&#8221; exhibits strong electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with complementary base&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiency. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the nucleotidoprotein and consequently promotes the intracellular release of native protein.







Abstract
Protein therapeutics targeting intracellular machineries hold profound potential for disease treatment, and hence robust cytosolic protein delivery technologies are imperatively demanded. Inspired by the super&#8208;negatively charged, nucleotide&#8208;enriched structure of nucleic acids, adenylated pro&#8208;proteins (A&#8208;proteins) with dramatically enhanced negative surface charges have been engineered for the first time via facile green synthesis. Then, thymidine&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine is developed, which exhibits strong electrostatic attraction, complementary base pairing, and hydrophobic interaction with A&#8208;proteins to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiencies. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the A&#8208;proteins and consequently promotes the intracellular release of the native proteins. This strategy shows high efficiency and universality for a variety of proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points in mammalian cells. Moreover, it enables highly efficient delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting fusion oncogene EWSR1&#8208;FLI1, leading to pronounced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy against Ewing sarcoma. This study provides a potent and versatile platform for cytosolic protein delivery and gene editing, and may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <dc:description>
A solid polymer electrolyte based on non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect of CD&#8208;Si and double transmission channels is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth and shuttle effect of polyiodide, achieving outstanding cycle&#8208;stability of symmetrical batteries and ultralong&#8208;life solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;I2 batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared a new porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) can reach 1.64&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1200&#8197;h at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery shows an ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Crosstalk between Hepatic Glutathione Efflux and Tumor Targeting Efficiency of Indocyanine Green&#8208;Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles</title>

Crosstalk between the liver and tumor can significantly impact the tumor targeting efficiency of thiol&#8208;responsive nanoparticles through hepatic glutathione efflux.







Abstract
The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in solid tumors has been used as a major hallmark for GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity. Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how this hepatic GSH efflux affects the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive indocyanine green&#8208;conjugated Au25 nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG&#8208;Au25SG18). The dissociation of ICG from Au25SG18 by the hepatic GSH through thiol&#8208;exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG&#8208;Au25SG18 and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione&#8208;mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well&#8208;known Kupffer cell&#8208;mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4] : Mn2+&#8212;A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence of Mn2+ is strongly affected by the ligand field. Usually only the metal&#8208;ligand distance is considered a tool to tune the ligand field strength in phosphors. Using Zn[B2(SO4)4] as a host, we show that electronic effects are an important alternative and lead to unusual orange luminescence of Mn2+.







Abstract
The impact of the surrounding ligand field is successfully exploited in the case of Eu2+ to tune the emission characteristics of inorganic photoactive materials with potential application in, e.g., phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;wLEDs). However, the photoluminescence of Mn2+ related to intraconfigurational 3d5&#8211;3d5 transitions is also strongly dependent on local ligand field effects and has been underestimated in this regard so far. In this work, we want to revive the idea how to electronically tune the emission color of a transition metal ion in inorganic hosts by unusual electronic effects in the metal&#8208;ligand bond. The concept is explicitly demonstrated for the weakly coordinating layer&#8208;like borosulfate ligand in the Mn2+&#8208;containing solid solutions Zn1&#8208;xMnx[B2(SO4)4] (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10). Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ shows orange narrow&#8208;band luminescence at 590&#8197;nm, which is an unusually short wavelength for octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ and indicates an uncommonly weak ligand field. On the other hand, the analysis of the interelectronic Racah repulsion parameters reveals ionic Mn&#8722;O bonds with values close to the Racah parameters of the free Mn2+ ion. Overall, this strategy demonstrates that electronic control of the metal&#8208;ligand bond can be a tool to make Mn2+ a potent alternative emitter to Eu2+ for inorganic phosphors.

         <dc:description>
A novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered organic&#8211;inorganic manganese bromide with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high thermal quenching resistance was developed and explored as a green phosphor for wide color gamut light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and as a scintillator for sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, with performance superior to that of most commercial phosphors and scintillators, respectively.







Abstract
Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (I150&#8201;&#176;C=84.1&#8201;%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a wide color gamut of 116&#8201;% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8722;1, a detection limit of 82.4&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This work presents a new avenue for the exploration of eco&#8208;friendly luminescent OIMHs towards multifunctional light&#8208;emitting applications.

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

Benefiting from the coordination stabilization of PAL ligands, the highly reversible high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;phase Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple is realized in near&#8208;neutral aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8722;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8722;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8722;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8722;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67&#8197;V but also exhibits excellent cyclability (100&#8201;% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8722;Mn battery high specific energy (600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8722;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8722;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.

         <title>Design of an Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photo&#8208;RAFT System for Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugation Achieving High Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of ROS on protein activity and secondary structure during photocatalysis. Specifically, it offers valuable insights into synthesizing protein&#8208;polymer conjugates while preserving high enzymatic activity under mild and aerobic conditions. The EY/TEOA system is identified as the optimal method for preparing conjugates, offering a simple and robust strategy with excellent oxygen tolerance in a minimal reaction volume.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo&#8208;initiated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (Photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin&#8197;Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo&#8208;RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity. To showcase the potential of this approach, lysozyme&#8208;poly(dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) conjugates were successfully prepared and exhibited enhanced antimicrobial property against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Superparamagnetic Composite Nanobeads Anchored with Molecular Glues for Ultrasensitive Label&#8208;free Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coverage of label&#8208;free proteomics for precious trace specimens is limited due to redundant pretreatments. We design molecular glue&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles equipped with protein anchors to capture proteins in complex trace biological samples. We propose a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) in one single tube to reduce protein loss for ultrasensitive proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry has emerged as a mainstream technique for label&#8208;free proteomics. However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95&#8201;%) and recovery (&#8776;90&#8201;%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified &#8776;1400 proteins from 5&#8197;&#956;L aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.

         <title>Directing the Selectivity of CO Electrolysis to Acetate by Constructing Metal&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;organic interface constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu phthalocyanine can direct the selectivity of CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product, with an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 84.2&#8201;%, a record acetate partial current density of 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an acetate yield up to 63.4&#8201;%. The impressive acetate selectivity is ascribed to the favorable reaction microenvironment created by the Cu&#8208;organic interface.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable chemicals holds great promise for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Owing to complex reaction pathways and shared rate&#8208;determining steps, directing the selectivity of CO2/CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product is very challenging. We report here a strategy for highly selective production of acetate from CO electrolysis by constructing metal&#8208;organic interfaces. We demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;organic interfaces constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu complexes show very impressive acetate selectivity, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;% and a carbon selectivity of 92.1&#8201;% for acetate production, in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The maximum acetate partial current density and acetate yield reach as high as 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 63.4&#8201;%, respectively. Thorough structural characterizations, control experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculation results indicate that the Cu&#8208;organic interface creates a favorable reaction microenvironment that enhances *CO adsorption, lowers the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling, and facilitates the formation of CH3COOH over other multicarbon products, thus rationalizing the selective acetate production.

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron&#8208;rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (PC), structurally complex cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity&#8208;mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.

     alt="Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4-Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleophilic 4-hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron-rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (&lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt;), structurally complex cyclobutane-fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4-hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4-hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity-mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane-fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O Contained Heterocycles as Fusion Locker in Multi&#8208;Resonance Frameworks towards Highly&#8208;efficient and Stable Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported to realize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission by incorporating B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O heterocycles as fusion lockers into conventional multi&#8208;resonant frameworks. Three emitters exhibited bright sky&#8208;blue emission with remarkably small full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of only 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm in solution. A high&#8208;performance OLED device was achieved with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm and a high EQE of up to 31.9&#8201;% with alleviated efficiency attenuation.







Abstract
Fusing condensed aromatics into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) frameworks has been an exquisite strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties, which, however, always sacrifices the small full width at half maxima (FWHM). Herein, we strategically embed B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O contained heterocycles as fusion locker into classical MR prototypes, which could enlarge the &#960;&#8208;extension and alleviate the steric repulsion for an enhanced planar skeleton to suppress the high&#8208;frequency stretching/ scissoring vibrations for ultra&#8208;narrowband emissions. Sky&#8208;blue emitters with extremely small FWHMs of 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm are thereafter obtained for the targeted emitters, decreased by (1.4&#8211;1.9)&#8208;fold compared with the prototypes. Benefiting from their high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and fast radiative decay rates of &gt;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, one of those emitters shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.9&#8201;% in sensitized devices, which remains 25.8&#8201;% at a practical luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm. Notably a long operation half&#8208;lifetime of 1,278&#8197;h is also recorded for the same device, representing one of the longest lifetimes among sky&#8208;blue devices based on MR emitters.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aminomethylation of Alkyl Halides Enabled by Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed aminomethylation of alkyl halides was realized for the synthesis of tertiary amines bearing bulky substituents and it involves radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The bulky N&#8208;substituents serve as an activation group to overcome the redox&#8208;potential barrier in these reactions, allowing synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines.







Abstract
The catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.

         <title>Tetracopper &#963;&#8208;Bound &#956;&#8208;Acetylide and &#8208;Diyne Units Stabilized by a Naphthyridine&#8208;based Dinucleating Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Reaction of two equivalents of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide species with an appropriate acetylide synthon allowed the rational synthesis of a molecular tetracopper(I) acetylide, which possesses an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode. This geometry opens the door to higher nuclearity homo&#8208; or heterometallic architectures, as demonstrated by the formation of a pentacopper(I) complex.







Abstract
Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#956;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal&#8208;metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne&#8208;containing clusters.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow for White&#8208;Light Emission and Information Encryption Based on Carbazole Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delayed fluorescence usually showed much shorter lifetime than phosphorescence in organic afterglow. An effective strategy is presented in this work to prolong the lifetime of delayed fluorescence to approach that of phosphorescence, which enables great color tunability of organic afterglow from yellow to white by changing the temperature.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;mode emission materials, combining phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, offer promising opportunities for white&#8208;light afterglow. However, the delayed fluorescence lifetime is usually significantly shorter than that of phosphorescence, limiting the duration of white&#8208;light emission. In this study, a carbazole&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system that can be activated by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light is reported to achieve balanced phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, resulting in a long&#8208;lived white&#8208;light afterglow. Our study demonstrated the critical role of a charge transfer state in the afterglow mechanism, where the charge separation and recombination process directly determined the lifetime of afterglow. Simultaneously, an efficient reversed intersystem crossing process was obtained between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states, which facilitating the delayed fluorescence properties of host&#8211;guest system. As a result, delayed fluorescence lifetime was successfully prolonged to approach that of phosphorescence. This work presents a delayed fluorescence lifetime improvement strategy via doping method to realize durable white&#8208;light afterglow.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Functionalized Fe4L6 Cages for Supramolecular Gold Catalyst Encapsulation to Control Substrate Activation Modes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate&#8208;functionalized gold catalyst and urea substrate have been found to be encapsulated in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage through hydrogen bonding. The caged catalyst presents excellent performances compared to the free catalyst, with high selectivity obtained from the site&#8208;isolation effect imposed by the cage only allowing catalysis by &#960; activation of the substrate. The high reactivity arises from stabilization of the transition state.







Abstract
The excellent catalytic performances of enzymes in terms of activity and selectivity are an inspiration for synthetic chemists and this has resulted in the development of synthetic containers for supramolecular catalysis. In such containers the local environment and pre&#8208;organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co&#8208;encapsulate a functionalized urea substrate through hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained, imposed by the cage as site isolation only allows catalysis through &#960; activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transitionstate stabilization rather than substrate pre&#8208;organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions, for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.

         <title>Photoinduced Cobalt Catalysis for the Reductive Coupling of Pyridines and Dienes Enabled by Paired Single&#8208;Electron Transfer
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, regioselective method for the hydropyridylation of diene feedstocks is reported, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalisation. Experiments and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving non&#8208;reversible hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in a reaction that is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins.







Abstract
Selective hydroarylation of dienes has potential to provide swift access to useful building blocks. However, most existing methods rely on dienes stabilised by an aromatic group and transmetallation or nucleophilic attack steps require electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners. As such, there are few examples which tolerate wide&#8208;spread heteroarenes such as pyridine. Whilst allylic C&#8722;H functionalisation could be considered an alternative approach, the positional selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates is hard to control. Here, we report a general approach for selective hydropyridylation of dienes under mild conditions using metal catalysed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer. Photoinduced, reductive conditions enable simultaneous formation of a cobalt&#8208;hydride catalyst and the persistent radical of easily&#8208;synthesised pyridyl phosphonium salts. This facilitates selective coupling of dienes in a traceless manner at the C4&#8208;position of a wide&#8208;range of pyridine substrates. The mildness of the method is underscored by its functional&#8208;group tolerance and demonstrated by applications in late&#8208;stage functionalisation. Based on a combination of experimental and computational studies, we propose a mechanistic pathway which proceeds through non&#8208;reversible hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from a cobalt hydride species which is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins due to a much higher relative barrier associated with olefin HAT.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;Substituted Diamide and Its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic characteristics of the kinetic state in supramolecular polymerization must be thoroughly understood to advance the design and synthesis of functional soft materials. This molecular dynamics study provides the same, along with new insights into the monomeric and thermodynamic states, thus addressing the origin of the lag phase. It also describes the minimum free&#8208;energy path from the kinetic to the thermodynamic states.







Abstract
The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule's torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8211;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones only. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.

         <dc:description>
An optimal set of phosphoramidite monomers was synthesized herein for facilitating the mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of digital poly(phosphodiester)s. These molecules contain a cleavable alkoxyamine group and various side&#8208;chain substituents with a distinct mass signature. When incorporated periodically in the polymers, these new molecules enable a controlled MS fragmentation and an easy identification of the resulting fragments.







Abstract
A library of phosphoramidite monomers containing a main&#8208;chain cleavable alkoxyamine and a side&#8208;chain substituent of variable molar mass (i.e. mass tag) was prepared in this work. These monomers can be used in automated solid&#8208;phase phosphoramidite chemistry and therefore incorporated periodically as spacers inside digitally&#8208;encoded poly(phosphodiester) chains. Consequently, the formed polymers contain tagged cleavable sites that guide their fragmentation in mass spectrometry sequencing and enhance their digital readability. The spacers were all prepared via a seven steps synthetic procedure. They were afterwards tested for the synthesis and sequencing of model digital polymers. Uniform digitally&#8208;encoded polymers were obtained as major species in all cases, even though some minor defects were sometimes detected. Furthermore, the polymers were decoded in pseudo&#8208;MS3 conditions, thus confirming the reliability and versatility of the spacers library.

         <title>Integrated Tandem Electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical Coupling of Biomass and Nitrate to Sustainable Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical strategy, the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic and waste nitrate were coupled into an amino acid, alanine. In detail, NO3&#8722; was electro&#8208;reduced to NH2OH, which could interact with PA to the form pyruvic oxime, and then the pyruvic oxime was electro&#8208;reduced to the desired alanine.







Abstract
Alanine is widely employed for synthesizing polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Electrocatalytic coupling of biomass molecules and waste nitrate is attractive for the nitrate removal and alanine production under ambient conditions. However, the reaction efficiency is relatively low due to the activation of the stable substrates, and the coupling of two reactive intermediates remains challenging. Herein, we realize the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electochemical synthesis of alanine from the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic acid (PA) and waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) catalyzed by PdCu nano&#8208;bead&#8208;wires (PdCu NBWs). The overall reaction pathway is demonstrated as a multiple&#8208;step catalytic cascade process via coupling the reactive intermediates NH2OH and PA on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, in this integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical catalytic cascade process, Cu facilitates the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to NH2OH intermediates, which chemically couple with PA to form the pyruvic oxime, and Pd promotes the electrochemical reduction of pyruvic oxime to the desirable alanine. This work provides a green strategy to convert waste NO3&#8722; to wealth and enriches the substrate scope of renewable biomass feedstocks to produce high&#8208;value amino acids.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was electro-reduced to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, which could interact with PA to the form pyruvic oxime, and then the pyruvic oxime was electro-reduced to the desired alanine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alanine is widely employed for synthesizing polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Electrocatalytic coupling of biomass molecules and waste nitrate is attractive for the nitrate removal and alanine production under ambient conditions. However, the reaction efficiency is relatively low due to the activation of the stable substrates, and the coupling of two reactive intermediates remains challenging. Herein, we realize the integrated tandem electrochemical-chemical-electochemical synthesis of alanine from the biomass-derived pyruvic acid (PA) and waste nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) catalyzed by PdCu nano-bead-wires (PdCu NBWs). The overall reaction pathway is demonstrated as a multiple-step catalytic cascade process via coupling the reactive intermediates NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and PA on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, in this integrated tandem electrochemical-chemical-electrochemical catalytic cascade process, Cu facilitates the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediates, which chemically couple with PA to form the pyruvic oxime, and Pd promotes the electrochemical reduction of pyruvic oxime to the desirable alanine. This work provides a green strategy to convert waste NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to wealth and enriches the substrate scope of renewable biomass feedstocks to produce high-value amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bismuth&#8208;Based Zeolitic Organic Framework with Coordination&#8208;Linked Metal Cages for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

A ligand&#8208;directing strategy is developed to build a bismuth&#8208;based zeolitic organic framework (Bi&#8208;ZMOFs) with coordination&#8208;linked metal cages for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH with 91&#8201;% efficiency. The coordination of Bi with pyrazole&#8208;N atom triggers an effective interatomic electron transfer and contributes to the activation of CO2 and stabilization of the active intermediates.







Abstract
Zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) have emerged as one of the most promsing catalysts for energy conversion, but they suffer from either weak bonding between metal&#8208;organic cubes (MOCs) that decrease their stability during catalysis processes or low activity due to inadequate active sites. In this work, through ligand&#8208;directing strategy, we successfully obtain an unprecedented bismuth&#8208;based ZMOF (Bi&#8208;ZMOF) featuring a ACO topological crystal structure with strong coordination bonding between the Bi&#8208;based cages. As a result, it enables efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) with Faradaic efficiency as high as 91&#8201;%. A combination of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals that the Bi&#8722;N coordination contributes to facilitating charge transfer from N to Bi atoms, which stabilize the intermediate to boost the reduction efficiency of CO2 to HCOOH. This finding highlights the importance of the coordination environment of metal active sites on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that this work will offer a new clue to rationally design zeolitic MOFs for catalytic reaction

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2S3 nanocrystals constitute a novel type of quantum dots exempt from toxic heavy metals whose fluorescence can be tuned from broad trap&#8208;state to narrow band&#8208;edge emission in the deep blue range by coating their surface with a ZnS shell. An additional alumina shell enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield close to 50&#8201;% while maintaining a short lifetime around 1&#8197;ns.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide band gap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3/ZnS/Al2O3. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect&#8208;mediated states leading to efficient deep&#8208;blue emission at 400&#8197;nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the PL quantum yield approaching 50&#8201;% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

A cyano hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework has been applied to a Li&#8208;CO2 battery for the first time. The HOF endows Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1800&#8197;h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96&#8197;V even at high current densities up to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel protic acyclic carbene&#8208;AuI enantiomers exhibited solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from crystals to helices driven by synergetic aurophilicity and H&#8208;bonds. Three polymorphs showed intense thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high quantum yield (&#934;FL). Extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains in helices amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with boosted luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) and CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds. Their aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95&#8201;% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au dimers with &#960;&#8208;stacking or one&#8208;dimensional extended Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains. Via drop&#8208;casting method, supramolecular P&#8208; or M&#8208;helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum|=0.030, &#934;FL=67&#8201;%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10&#8722;3. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)-active materials. Herein, we report a solvation-mediated self-assembly from single-crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H-bonds. Their aggregation-dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;FL&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 95&#8201;% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au dimers with &#960;-stacking or one-dimensional extended Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains. Via drop-casting method, supramolecular &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;-helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|=0.030, &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;FL&lt;/sub&gt;=67&#8201;%) and high CPL brightness (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4.87&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading Pd NCs on the Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2, we were able to promote the proton deintercalation process on the catalyst surface as well as HMF adsorption, respectively. As a result, a comprehensive optimization in performance by simultaneously decreasing the onset potential of the reaction and enhancing the current density can be achieved.







Abstract
The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96&#8197;nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32&#8197;V and achieved a current density of 50&#8197;mA/cm2 at only 1.38&#8197;V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8722;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8722;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8722;O.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cryolite material (Cs2NaHoCl6) has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence. Further, its luminescence efficiency can be effectively improved and the emission was tailored through alloying Sb3+ ions (s&#8208;p energy levels) and Yb3+ ions (f&#8208;f energy levels). These findings highlight the immense potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s&#8208;p transitions) and Yb3+ (f&#8208;f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334&#8197;nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980&#8197;nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti&#8208;thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+ doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+ in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four ribbon&#8208;like bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules were synthesized by intermolecular or intramolecular radical&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. They show electronic structures resembling the typical pyrenacenes rather than quinoidal rylenes, with localized aromatic benzenoid rings along the central long axis.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of In&#8208;Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation concept is developed by introducing taurine into electrolyte. In addition to buffering the pH of the electrolyte, the preferentially adsorbed taurine on the Zn surface reconstructs the electronic double layer (EDL) and subsequently builds an in situ hybrid interface to inhibit side reactions and regulate Zn deposition. This synergistic modulation strategy greatly enhances the performance of Zn anode and full batteries.







Abstract
In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn2+ diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de&#8208;solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra&#8208;high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

     alt="Synergistic Modulation of In-Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra-Stable Zinc Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synergistic modulation concept is developed by introducing taurine into electrolyte. In addition to buffering the pH of the electrolyte, the preferentially adsorbed taurine on the Zn surface reconstructs the electronic double layer (EDL) and subsequently builds an in situ hybrid interface to inhibit side reactions and regulate Zn deposition. This synergistic modulation strategy greatly enhances the performance of Zn anode and full batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de-solvation of hydrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra-high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Utilized sulfonic acid&#8208;modified COFs (TCOF&#8208;S) photo&#8208;catalyst to generate free radicals to trigger the rapid in situ light solidification of acrylamide in the pore channels of COFs. Formed TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel has combined polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) with single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) and make them complement each other.







Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2&#8197;mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248&#8197;mAh/g at 1C), excellent rate capability (90&#8197;mAh/g at 10C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large&#8208;scaled flexible high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of converting NO into pyridine oximes utilizing in situ generated NH2OH for organophpsphorus poisoning is realized by electrocatalysis over Al coordinated on nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance to synthesize medicine and multidisciplinary science, providing new insights for constructing new efficient system for NH2OH production and utilization.







Abstract
Pyridine oximes produced from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8&#8201;% and a yield of 92.1&#8201;%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8722;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.

Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoexcited PFBT was reduced by triethanolamine (TEOA) first, then bound with CO2 before CO production.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable fuels is desirable to realize a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we report that polymer dots (Pdots) of poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT), without adding any extra co&#8208;catalyst, can photocatalyze reduction of CO2 into CO in aqueous solution, rendering a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a detectable selectivity of up to 100&#8201;%. After 5 cycles of CO2 re&#8208;purging experiments, no distinct decline in CO amount and reaction rate was observed, indicating the promising photocatalytic stability of PFBT Pdots in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. A mechanistic study reveals that photoexcited PFBT Pdots are reduced by sacrificial donor first, then the reduced PFBT Pdots can bind CO2 and reduce it into CO via their intrinsic active sites. This work highlights the application of organic Pdots for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution, which therefore provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly nanoparticulate photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly oxidized eunicellane&#8208;derived 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C, were discovered through genome mining. In vivo and in vitro investigations and quantum chemical computations systematically established that terpene cyclase (TC) and P450 enzymes work in tandem to create the backbone of aridacins, representing an unprecedented strategy in terpene skeletal construction.

Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC&#8208;like enzymes are known but are very rare. In this study, we genome&#8208;mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named ari, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain Amycolatopsis arida. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C (1&#8211;3), that possess a 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a noncanonical two&#8208;step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic cis&#8208;eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold through C2&#8722;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF&#8208;mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.

A photolabile curcumin analogue CRANAD&#8208;147 is reported. It could lead to changes in properties, structures (sequences) and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species in vitro and in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo with molecularly generated light (dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;) from chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. It has great potential as an alternative approach for AD drug discovery.







Abstract
The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs has recently witnessed substantial achievement. To further enhance the pool of drug candidates, it is crucial to explore non&#8208;traditional therapeutic avenues. In this study, we present the use of a photolabile curcumin&#8208;diazirine analogue, CRANAD&#8208;147, to induce changes in properties, structures (sequences), and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species both in cells and in vivo. This manipulation was achieved through irradiation with LED light or molecularly generated light, dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, emitted by the chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD&#8208;147/LED or CRANAD&#8208;147/ADLumin&#8208;4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient hydrogenative PET degradation protocol was developed under mild conditions enabled by a novel transesterification/hydrogenation relay strategy and rationally designed catalysts. A broad range of post&#8208;consumer PET sources and other types of polyesters were easily degraded in excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the evolution of catalyst and the important role of methanol for promoting the reaction efficiency.







Abstract
The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar H2. The key to the success of this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Enhanced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Polymer Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disorder is usually considered to cause photoluminescence quenching by dissipating excited&#8208;state energy, here we challenge the conventional wisdom by showing that increased disorder from crystalline to polymer media actually enhances room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, when a mediating charge&#8208;transfer state is involved.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have important applications for biological imaging, oxygen sensing, data encryption, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the many advantages polymeric materials offer such as great control over gas permeability and processing flexibility, disorder is traditionally considered as an intrinsic negative impact on the efficiency for embedded RTP luminophores, as various allowed thermal motions could quench the emitting states. However, we propose that such disorder&#8208;enabled freedoms of microscopic motions can be beneficial for charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated RTP, which is facilitated by molecular conformational changes among different electronic transition states. Using the &#8220;classic&#8221; pyrene&#8208;aniline exciplex as an example, we demonstrate the mutual enhancement of red/near&#8208;infrared and green RTP emissions from the pyrene and aniline moieties, respectively, upon doping the aniline polymer with trace pyrene derivatives. In comparison, a pyrene&#8208;doped crystal formed with the same aniline structure exhibits only charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence with no red or green RTP observed, suggesting that order suppresses the RTP channels. The proposed polymerization strategy may be used as a unified method to generate multi&#8208;emissive polymeric RTP materials from a vast pool of known and unknown exciplexes and charge&#8208;transfer complexes.

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

The photogenerated radicals effectively inhibit metal atom aggregation and facilitate their cooperative anchoring with nitrogen species and lattice oxygen on the support, thereby enabling precise synthesis of Single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We streamline the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms by sequentially generating two heteroatom metal carbenes using a designer I(III)/S(VI) reagent. This strategy enables the selective addition of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or carbon atoms, incorporating up to three functional groups at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyls in a single step.







Abstract
Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8722;H bond (where X=O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8722;H bond. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;S double insertion, and C&#8722;S/Y&#8722;H double insertion (where Y=S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, economical, and direct approach to access &#945;,&#946;&#8208;deuterated styrene compounds via triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;mediated electrochemical deuteration of styrenes and derivatives through electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT) has been developed. This approach tolerated a wide range of styrenes and 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, and the extension to late stage deuteration of complex molecules and their derivatives showed a potential prospect.







Abstract
Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.

         <title>Decorating Channel Walls in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Crown Ethers for Efficient and Selective Separation of Radioactive Strontium(II)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF adsorbent is fabricated for the removal of radioactive strontium(II) from nuclear wastewater. Benefiting from the synergy of the 1D channels for efficient transportation of Sr2+ ions and the decorating of the functional sites on the channel walls to aviod the blocking of the channels, the MOF adsorbent realizes highly efficient and ultrafast separation of strontium(II).







Abstract
Nuclear accidents and the improper disposal of nuclear wastes have led to serious environmental radioactive pollutions. The rational design of adsorbents for the highly efficient separation of strontium(II) is essential in treating nuclear waste and recovering radioactive strontium resources. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential materials for the separation of aqueous metal ions owing to their designable structure and tunable functionality. Herein, a novel 3D MOF material MOF&#8208;18Cr6, in which 1D channels are formed using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether&#8208;containing ligands as channel walls, is fabricated for strontium(II) separation. In contrast to traditional MOFs designed by grafting functional groups in the framework pores, MOF&#8208;18Cr6 possesses regular 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether cavities on the channel walls, which not only can transport and intake strontium(II) via the channels, but also prevent blockage of the channels after the binding of strontium(II). Consequently, the functional sites are fully utilized to achieve a high strontium(II) removal rate of 99.73&#8201;% in simulated nuclear wastewater. This study fabricates a highly promising adsorbent for the separation of aqueous radioactive strontium(II), and more importantly, can provide a new strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF adsorbents for separating target substances from complex aqueous environments.

         <title>Direct Assembly of Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;phenolic network nanoparticles (MPN NPs) with different compositions are directly assembled, without templates or seeding agents, by controlling the coordination kinetics of metal&#8208;phenolic complexes. The strong binding affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules enables the incorporation of functional cargos (e.g., proteins and drugs) to form cargo&#8208;loaded MPN NPs for potential biomedical applications.







Abstract
Coordination assembly offers a versatile means to developing advanced materials for various applications. However, current strategies for assembling metal&#8208;organic networks into nanoparticles (NPs) often face challenges such as the use of toxic organic solvents, cytotoxicity because of synthetic organic ligands, and complex synthesis procedures. Herein, we directly assemble metal&#8208;organic networks into NPs using metal ions and polyphenols (i.e., metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs)) in aqueous solutions without templating or seeding agents. We demonstrate the role of buffers (e.g., phosphate buffer) in governing NP formation and the engineering of the NP physicochemical properties (e.g., tunable sizes from 50 to 270&#8197;nm) by altering the assembly conditions. A library of MPN NPs is prepared using natural polyphenols and various metal ions. Diverse functional cargos, including anticancer drugs and proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points, are readily loaded within the NPs for various applications (e.g., biocatalysis, therapeutic delivery) by direct mixing, without surface modification, owing to the strong affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules. This study provides insights into the assembly mechanism of metal&#8208;organic complexes into NPs and offers a simple strategy to engineer nanosized materials with desired properties for diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

The stacking of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. The unique binary stacking modes of the [Cu2Br(IN)2]n nanosheets offers a chance to understand the relationship between nanosheet stacking behaviors and the gas separation performance of the resulting membranes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN=isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt;290 with H2 permeance &gt;520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt;190 with H2 permeance &gt;590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.

         <title>Synthetic Membraneless Droplets for Synaptic&#8208;Like Clustering of Lipid Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new aqueous droplet as mimic of membraneless organelles (MLOs), which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets, apart from the widely known complex coacervates and neutral polymer&#8208;based aqueous two&#8208;phase systems. The SA droplet exhibits MLO&#8208;mimicking complex phase behaviors and can cluster charged lipid vesicles like MLOs at synapse, which has been hitherto unachievable for most current MLO&#8208;mimics.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, the membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are found to interact intimately with membranous organelles (MOs). One major mode is the clustering of MOs by MLOs, such as the formation of clusters of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals mediated by the synapsin&#8208;rich MLOs. Aqueous droplets, including complex coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems, have been plausible MLO&#8208;mimics to emulate or elucidate biological processes. However, neither of them can cluster lipid vesicles (LVs) like MLOs. In this work, we develop a synthetic droplet assembled from a combination of two different interactions underlying the formation of these two droplets, namely, associative and segregative interactions, which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets. The SA droplets cluster and disperse LVs recapitulating the key functional features of synapsin condensates, which can be attributed to the weak electrostatic interaction environment provided by SA droplets. This work suggests LLPS with combined segregative and associative interactions as a possible route for synaptic clustering of lipid vesicles and highlights SA droplets as plausible MLO&#8208;mimics and models for studying and mimicking related cellular dynamics.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Fluorine Groups in Passivating Defects for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In passivating perovskite defects it is shown that the F group can interact with the passivation groups of the additives, leading to different abilities to passivate defects rather than only introducing additional interactions between F and Pb2+ as previously thought. The efficiencies of perovskite solar cells and modules made with the fluorinated passivators reach 24.70&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.13&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2), respectively, with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Introducing fluorine (F) groups into a passivator plays an important role in enhancing the defect passivation effect for the perovskite film, which is usually attributed to the direct interaction of F and defect states. However, the interaction between electronegative F and electron&#8208;rich passivation groups in the same molecule, which may influence the passivation effect, is ignored. We herein report that such interactions can vary the electron cloud distribution around the passivation groups and thus changing their coordination with defect sites. By comparing two fluorinated molecules, heptafluorobutylamine (HFBM) and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), we find that the F/&#8722;NH2 interaction in HFBM is stronger than the F/&#8722;COOH one in HFBA, inducing weaker passivation ability of HFBM than HFBA. Accordingly, HFBA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide an efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0&#8197;cm2) based on HFBA reaches 21.13&#8201;%. Our work offers an insight into understanding an unaware role of the F group in impacting the passivation effect for the perovskite film.

         <title>Functional Polythioamides Derived from Thiocarbonyl Fluoride
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythioamides have been successfully synthesized using diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. These polythioamides exhibit inherent selectivity in coordinating metal ions, resulting in the formation of PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles that can serve as recyclable homogeneous catalysts. This study highlights the potential of thiocarbonyl fluoride as a powerful hub for addressing the challenging synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polythioamide is a unique type of sulfur&#8208;containing polymer with advanced functionalities. Nonetheless, the elemental sulfur commonly used in their synthesis tends to react readily with unsaturated functional groups, thereby limiting the scope of eligible substrates. Inspired by the highly efficient sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) polymerization through discrete hubs, we present herein a pioneering and versatile approach to the synthesis of polythioamides from diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. Well&#8208;defined structures, including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were realized. These newly devised polythioamides can efficiently and selectively bind to metal ions and were applied in precious&#8208;metal recovery. Further development resulted in PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles serving as recyclable homogeneous catalysts, thus demonstrating the vast potential of these unprecedented polythioamides. We anticipate that thiocarbonyl fluoride could emerge as a potent hub for facilitating the intricate synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fragment ions&lt;/b&gt; are well recognized as elusive species in mass spectrometry, typically employed for analytical purposes. In their Communication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202308600"&gt;(e202308600)&lt;/a&gt;, Jonas Warneke et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the reaction products of fragment ions formed in the gas phase can be &#8220;harvested&#8221; from a preparative mass spectrometer to become &#8220;building blocks&#8221; in chemical synthesis.

Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202307086), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With the Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

Two dimeric acceptors , DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized by linking two Y6&#8208;derivative segments using different central linking bridges: selenophene and thiophene. Both adopt a favorable O&#8208;shape conformation as confirmed by simulations and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Paired with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer donor PM6, optimized solar cells employing DIBP3F&#8208;Se showcase remarkable performance with a power conversion efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, as demonstrated by Donghong Yu, Thomas&#8197;D. Anthopoulos, Ergang Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302888).

Mn2+&#160; is a so&#8208;far still rather underestimated visible emitter that is more abundant than the currently dominantly used emitter Eu2+. This could be a possible alternative for future LED phosphors. The cover picture shows octahedrally coordinated Mn2+&#160;ions embedded in the borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]. Borosulfates are weakly coordinating ligands, which is directly reflected in the photoluminescence properties of the Mn2+ ions: They show orange narrow emission, which is indicative for a weak octahedral ligand field, as explained by J&#246;rn Bruns, Markus Suta et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309212).

         <title>Preparative Scale Applications of C&#8722;H Activation in Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers examples where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale for the synthesis of drugs/drug candidates. Key features of the optimization process, challenges and potential of such methods in the pharmaceutical industry are discussed for various metals and transformations.







Abstract
C&#8722;H activation is an attractive methodology to increase molecular complexity without requiring substrate prefunctionalization. In contrast to well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling methods, C&#8722;H activation is less explored on large scales and its use in the production of pharmaceuticals faces substantial hurdles. However, the inherent advantages, such as shorter synthetic routes and simpler starting materials, motivate medicinal chemists and process chemists to overcome these challenges, and exploit C&#8722;H activation steps for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In this review, we will cover examples of drugs/drug candidates where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale (range between 355&#8197;mg and 130&#8197;kg). The optimization processes will be described, and each example will be examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, providing the reader with an in&#8208;depth understanding of the challenges and potential of C&#8722;H activation methodologies in the production of pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling (eXEC) Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) has emerged as a practical, green, sustainable, efficient electrochemical and controllable approach for constructing C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bonds through selective cross&#8208;coupling of different electrophiles. This Mini&#8208;review summarizes the recent protocols of electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry utilizes electrons as a potent, controllable, and traceless alternative to chemical oxidants or reductants, and typically offers a more sustainable option for achieving selective organic synthesis. Recently, the merger of electrochemistry with readily available electrophiles has been recognized as a viable and increasingly popular methodology for efficiently constructing challenging C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds in a sustainable manner for complex organic molecules. In this mini&#8208;review, we have systematically summarized the most recent advances in electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) reactions during the last decade. Our focus has been on readily available electrophiles, including aryl and alkyl organic (pseudo)halides, as well as small molecules such as CO2, SO2, and D2O.

         <title>P&#8208;type Polymers in Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics combine the functions of photovoltaic conversion and visual semitransparency. The p&#8208;type polymers used in semitransparent organic photovoltaics are systematically summarized from the perspectives of chemical structures, conformation structures, and aggregation structures. The design guidelines for novel p&#8208;type polymers in high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics are also proposed.







Abstract
P&#8208;type polymers are polymeric semiconducting materials that conduct holes and have extensive applications in optoelectronics such as organic photovoltaics. Taking the advantage of intrinsic discontinuous light absorption of organic semiconductors, semitransparent organic photovoltaics (STOPVs) present compelling opportunities in various potential applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics, automobiles, and wearable electronics. The characteristics of p&#8208;type polymers, including optical, electronic, and morphological properties, determine the performance of STOPVs, and the requirements for p&#8208;type polymers differ between opaque organic photovoltaics and STOPVs. Hence, in this Minireview, recent advances of p&#8208;type polymers used in STOPVs are systematically summarized, with emphasis on the effects of chemical structures, conformation structures, and aggregation structures of p&#8208;type polymers on the performance of STOPVs. Furthermore, new design concepts and guidelines are also proposed for p&#8208;type polymers to facilitate the future development of high&#8208;performance STOPVs.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is the most crucial issue hindering the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. This review concentrates on the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites from the chemical mechanism, detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level, and especially intrinsic causes/extrinsic causes to provide clear guidelines to accurately suppress the oxidation.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14&#8201;%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of an in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.

         <title>Fluorogenic and Cell&#8208;Permeable Rhodamine Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Live&#8208;Cell Protein Labeling in Bioimaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the equilibrium between a nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion state (protein&#8208;bound), fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamine dyes have been developed for high&#8208;contrast protein labeling in living cells. Such new generation of probes offer exceptional performance in multi&#8208;color/lifetime imaging, superresolution microscopy, single protein tracking, and chemigenetic biosensors.







Abstract
The advancement of fluorescence microscopy techniques has opened up new opportunities for visualizing proteins and unraveling their functions in living biological systems. Small&#8208;molecule organic dyes, which possess exceptional photophysical properties, small size, and high photostability, serve as powerful fluorescent reporters in protein imaging. However, achieving high&#8208;contrast live&#8208;cell labeling of target proteins with conventional organic dyes remains a considerable challenge in bioimaging and biosensing due to their inadequate cell permeability and high background signal. Over the past decade, a novel generation of fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable dyes has been developed, which have substantially improved live&#8208;cell protein labeling by fine&#8208;tuning the reversible equilibrium between a cell&#8208;permeable, nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion (protein&#8208;bound) of rhodamines. In this review, we present the mechanism and design strategies of these fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamines, as well as their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Induced Polar Tri&#8208;layered Perovskite for Record&#8208;Performance Polarized Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lone&#8208;pair electron in MHy+ (methylhydrazine) results in the generation of a dipole moment. The dipole moments aggregate to give polarization, which is detected with a steady open&#8208;circuit voltage. Polarized detectors using the (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine) single&#8208;crystal have an ultrahigh polarization ratio of up to 24.6 in self&#8208;powered mode, this ratio is a record for organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite single&#8208;crystals.







Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect, a promising optoelectronic phenomenon for generating polarized dependent steady&#8208;state photocurrent, has been widely applied in various photodetectors. However, incorporating stereochemically active lone pair to construct bulk photovoltage in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) is still elusive and challenging. Herein, bulk photovoltage (1.2&#8197;V) has been successfully achieved by introducing the stereo&#8208;chemically active lone pair perovskitizer to construct a polar tri&#8208;layered hybrid perovskite, namely, (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (1, IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine, MHy=methylhydrazine). Strikingly, owning to the promising bulk photovoltage, 1&#8208;based detectors exhibit an ultra&#8208;highly sensitive polarized photodetection (polarization ratio of up to 24.6) under self&#8208;powered mode. This ratio surpasses all the reported two&#8208;dimension OIHP single&#8208;crystal photodetectors. In addition, detectors exhibit outstanding responsivity (&#8776;200&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (&#8776;2.4&#215;1013 Jones). More excitingly, further investigation confirms that lone pair electrons in MHy+ result in the separation of positive and negative charges to produce directional dipoles, which further directional alignment to generate bulk photovoltage, thereby resulting in polarization&#8208;dependent photocurrent. Our findings provide a new demonstration for polar multilayer materials&#8217; construction and may open opportunities for a host of high&#8208;sensitive polarized photodetection.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis with Gaseous Molecular Ions: Harvesting [B12Br11N2]&#8722; from a Mass Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion [B12Br11N2]&#8722; was previously only observed in mass spectra. Reactions of gaseous fragment ions and high current ion soft&#8208;landing were combined to synthesize this molecular ion and enable its analysis by NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as to explore follow&#8208;up reactions in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the products of ion&#8208;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass&#8208;selection and soft&#8208;landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

A building block assembling method allows a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites to be constructed. The resulting species have unprecedent gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors potentially boosting future non&#8208;volatile memory applications.







Abstract
Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n=1&#8211;5; HA=hexylamine and MA=methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n=&#8734;, Tc=239&#8197;K) to n=2 (Tc=310&#8197;K, &#916;T=71&#8197;K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent &#8776;19.74&#8197;&#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177;60&#8197;V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non&#8208;volatile memory devices.

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of strong aliphatic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is disclosed via an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with simple alkanes. The inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds are efficiently cleaved through intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer, providing an alternative organocatalytic approach for alkane C&#8722;H functionalization under transition metal&#8208; and light free conditions.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives increasing attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains scarce, especially when dealing with challenging C&#8722;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8722;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective De Novo Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diaryl Ketones from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from alkynes through chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is demonstrated. This method also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.

         <title>Divergent and Selective Light Alkene Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, a reductive Heck coupling, and a Heck/Kumada coupling of light alkenes are reported herein. These strategies enable highly efficient hydro&#8208;arylation/&#8208;vinylation, (di)arylation, vinylation, and aryl&#8208;vinylation transformations thus accessing alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. This coupling strategy provides a modular and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock light alkenes.







Abstract
Light olefins are abundantly manufactured in the petroleum industry and thus represent ideal starting materials for modern chemical synthesis. Selective and divergent transformations of feedstock light olefins to value&#8208;added chemicals are highly sought&#8208;after but remain challenging. Herein we report an exceptionally regioselective carbonickelation of light alkenes followed by in situ trapping with three types of nucleophiles, namely a reductant, base, or Grignard reagent. This protocol enables efficient 1,2&#8208;hydrofunctionalization, dicarbofunctionalization, and branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling of light alkenes with aryl and alkenyl reagents to streamline access to diverse alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. Harnessing bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands with acenaphthyl backbones for nickel catalysts is crucial to attain high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy provides a rare, modular, and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock alkenes and is expected to find broad applications in medicinal chemistry and industrial processes.

         <title>Forcing Twisted 1,7&#8208;Dibromoperylene Diimides to Flatten in the Solid State: What a Difference an Atom Makes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of CH2 or NH spacers of low stereochemical hindrance on the imide function of heavily twisted 1,7&#8208;dibromoperylene diimides (PDIs), enables, in the solid state, the unexpected flattening of the polyaromatic cores. Powder diffraction and DFT calculations provided reliable structural and energetic details and an estimate of stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of flat PDI cores, counterbalancing the natural tendency toward twisting.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDI) are workhorses in the field of organic electronics, owing to their appealing n&#8208;semiconducting properties. Optimization of their performances is widely pursued by bay&#8208;atom substitution and diverse imide functionalization. Bulk solids and thin&#8208;films of these species crystallize in a variety of stacking configurations, depending on the geometry of the stable conformation of the polyaromatic core. We here demonstrate that 1,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;substituted perylene diimides, PDI(H2Br2), possessing a heavily twisted conformation in the gas phase, in solution and in the solids, can be easily flattened in the solid state into centrosymmetric molecules if the polyaromatic cores form &#960;&#8211;&#960; stabilized chains. This is achieved by using axial residues with low stereochemical hindrance, as guaranteed by a single CH2/NH spacer directly linked to the imide function. Structural powder diffraction and DFT calculations on four newly designed species of the PDI(H2Br2) class coherently show that, thanks to the flexibility of the N&#8722;X&#8722;Ar link (X=CH2/NH), flat cores are indeed obtained by overcoming the interconversion barrier between twisted atropoisomers, of only 26.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This strategy may then be useful to induce &#8220;anomalously flat&#8221; polyaromatic cores of different kinds (substituted acenes/rylenes) in the solid state, towards suitable crystal packing and orbital interactions for improved electronic performances.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Polyethylene with In&#8208;Chain Photolyzable and Hydrolyzable Groups Enabling Recycling and Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain keto groups (keto&#8208;PE) yields mixed keto&#8208;ester&#8208;PE, which combines photodegradability of the in&#8208;chain ketones with the in&#8208;chain esters as chemical access point for solvolysis, while the basic materials properties of HDPE are fully retained.







Abstract
Polyethylenes endowed with low densities of in&#8208;chain hydrolyzable and photocleavable groups can improve their circularity and potentially reduce their environmental persistency. We show with model polymers derived from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that the simultaneous presence of both groups has no adverse effect on the polyethylene crystal structure and thermal properties. Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of keto&#8208;polyethylenes from non&#8208;alternating catalytic ethylene&#8208;CO chain growth copolymerization yield high molecular weight in&#8208;chain keto&#8208;ester polyethylenes (Mn&#8776;50.000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Oxidation can proceed without chain scission and consequently the desirable materials properties of HDPE are retained. At the same time we demonstrate the suitability of the in&#8208;chain ester groups for chemical recycling by methanolysis, and show that photolytic degradation by extended exposure to simulated sunlight occurs via the keto groups.

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#8722;Se/Te&#8722;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive thermochromism observed in dichalcogenide molecular crystals with no clear structural origin or associated phase transitions is found to be linked to the subtle changes in torsional vibrational modes around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds.







Abstract
We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100&#8197;K and 295&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism&#8212;especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.

     alt="The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#8722;Se/Te&#8722;Te Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elusive thermochromism observed in dichalcogenide molecular crystals with no clear structural origin or associated phase transitions is found to be linked to the subtle changes in torsional vibrational modes around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100&#8197;K and 295&#8197;K. High-pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism&#8212;especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds. Further, a co-crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Activation of Transesterification by Chemical Amplification in Dynamic Thiol&#8208;Ene Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of chemical amplification has been explored for the on&#8208;demand release of hydroxy groups in dynamic covalent thiol&#8208;ene photopolymers by controlled activation of a photoacid. In a domino effect fashion, a single photon event leads to a cascade of reactions, which ultimately endow the polymers with the ability to flow as a result of thermo&#8208;activated transesterification.







Abstract
Chemical amplification is a well&#8208;established concept in photoresist technology, wherein one photochemical event leads to a cascade of follow&#8208;up reactions that facilitate a controlled change in the solubility of a polymer. Herein, we transfer this concept to dynamic polymer networks to liberate both catalyst and functional groups required for bond exchange reactions under UV irradiation. For this, we exploit a photochemically generated acid to catalyse a deprotection reaction of an acid&#8208;labile tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl group, which is employed to mask the hydroxy groups of a vinyl monomer. At the same time, the released acid serves as a catalyst for thermo&#8208;activated transesterifications between the deprotected hydroxy and ester moieties. Introduced in an orthogonally cured (450&#8197;nm) thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, this approach allows for a spatio&#8208;temporally controlled activation of bond exchange reactions, which is crucial in light of the creep resistance versus reflow ability trade&#8208;off of dynamic polymer networks.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse structural designs has led to the development of chalcone&#8208;flavylium systems that exhibit efficient switching across a wide spectrum of visible light, including long&#8208;wavelength red light in aqueous environments avoiding the typical UV&#8208;induced switches.







Abstract
The chalcone&#8208;flavylium photochromic system switches in aqueous media. However, the chalcone&#8594;flavylium conversion requires detrimental ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light for the switching which deters their applications in the biological domain. To address this issue, we have synthesized strategically modified chalcone scaffolds that can be reversibly switched to the flavylium forms with visible light ranging from 456&#8197;nm (blue) to 640&#8197;nm (red).

         <title>Ligand Modifications Produce Two&#8208;Step Magnetic Switching in a Cobalt(dioxolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution and solid&#8208;state measurements provide support for the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. Employing a dynamic ligand scaffold may be the key to stabilizing the rare low spin Co(II) intermediate state and traversing both valence tautomeric and spin crossover transitions.







Abstract
Mononuclear monodioxolene valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complexes typically exist in their low spin (l.s.) CoIII(cat2&#8722;) and high spin (h.s.) CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) forms (cat2&#8722;=catecholato, and sq&#8901;&#8722;=seminquinonato forms of 3,5&#8722;di&#8722;tBu&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolene), which reversibly interconvert via temperature&#8208;dependent intramolecular electron transfer. Typically, the remaining four coordination sites on cobalt are supported by a tetradentate ligand whose properties influence the temperature at which VT occurs. We report that replacing one chelating pyridyl arm of tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (tpa) with a weaker field ortho&#8208;anisole moiety facilitates access to a third magnetic state, and examine a series of related complexes. Variable temperature crystallographic, magnetic, calorimetric, and spectroscopic studies support that this third state is consistent with l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;). Thus, our ligand modifications not only provide access to the VT transition from l.s. CoIII(cat2&#8722;) to l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), but at higher temperatures, the complex undergoes spin crossover from l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) to h.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), representing the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. We hypothesize that ligand dynamicity may facilitate access to the rarely observed l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) intermediate state, suggesting a new design criterion in the development of stimulus&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;state molecular switches.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradical was isolated without any kinetic blocking at the central m&#8208;phenylene bridge. An EPR study and quantum chemical calculations suggest the triplet state to be the ground state.







Abstract
A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, 108&#8197;years after Schlenk's m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as a diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Specific Silicon&#8208;Containing Conjugating Reagent: &#946;&#8208;Silyl Alkynyl Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of silicon&#8208;containing alkynone reagents that target free thiols to produce the stable vinyl&#8208;sulfide linker under biocompatible conditions is reported. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is also applicable to the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and pharmaceuticals with full retention of silicon handles in most cases.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules has been recognized as a versatile and powerful strategy for probing our biological systems and discovering novel therapeutics. The addition of lipophilic silicon moiety opens up new avenues for multi&#8208;disciplinary research with broad applications in both the medicinal and material sciences. However, adhering to the strict biocompatibility requirements, and achieving the introduction of labile silicon handle and high chemo&#8208;selectivity have been formidable. In this paper, we report silicon&#8208;based conjugating reagents including &#946;&#8208;trialkylsilyl and silyl ether&#8208;tethered alkynones that selectively react with thiols under physiological conditions. The pH&#8208;neutral, metal&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free reaction yields stable products with broad substrate compatibility and full retention of silicon handles in most cases. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is applicable in the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and payloads, thereby expanding the toolbox of thiol conjugation.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroenzymatic catalysis of the multisubunit complex formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase was investigated (left panel). The O2&#8208;sensitive enzyme isolated from a thermophilic methanogen reduces CO2 with high faradaic efficiency upon deposition on a graphite rod electrode (middle panel). The low affinity for formate (right panel) favoured its accumulation, an interesting property for CO2&#8208;conversion technologies.







Abstract
Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While a few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109&#177;1&#8201;%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.

         <title>Zincophilic Interfacial Manipulation against Dendrite Growth and Side Reactions for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a multifunctional interphase layer to achieve highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer enables the homogenized Zn2+ flux, rapid desolvation kinetics, enhanced Zn2+ transference number, and suppressed side reactions, thus contributing to the high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced cycling performance with dendrite&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Constructing multifunctional interphases to suppress the rampant Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions is crucial for Zn anodes. Herein, a phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a versatile interphase layer to stabilize Zn anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer can manipulate Zn2+ flux and promote rapid desolvation kinetics, ensuring the uniform Zn deposition with dendrite&#8208;free morphology. Moreover, the robust PA&#8208;ZnAl protective layer can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of byproducts, further contributing to the reversible Zn plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, the Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650&#8197;h tested at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining three supramolecular sensing elements in a single solution forms an adaptive network of equilibrating sensors. Fingerprint sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte interactions results in emergent photophysical responses, allowing for the discrimination of highly similar challenging analytes.







Abstract
Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins and protein mixtures without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network's ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.

         <title>Photocatalytic Terminal C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction Inside Water Soluble Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for light&#8208;activated Glaser coupling in water is reported that uses visible light to trigger host&#8208;guest photoredox chemistry. Cage&#8208;confined neutral radicals drive the C&#8722;C coupling step through substrate preorganization.







Abstract
Developing methods that activate C&#8722;H bonds directly with high selectivity for C&#8722;C bond formation in complex organic synthesis has been a major chemistry challenge. Recently it has been shown that photoactivation of weakly polarized C&#8722;H bonds can be carried out inside a cationic water&#8208;soluble nanocage with visible light&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) chemistry. Using this novel photoredox activation paradigm, here we demonstrate C&#8722;C bond formation to photo&#8208;generate 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature in water from terminal aromatic alkynes for the first time. The formation of cavity&#8208;confined alkyne radical cation and the proton&#8208;removed neutral radical species highlight the unique C&#8722;C coupling step driven by supramolecular preorganization.

         <title>Combination of Resonance and Non&#8208;Resonance Chiral Raman Scattering in a Cobalt(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman optical activity is becoming a useful tool to study geometry and electronic structure of molecules. For a cobalt complex we report large signal enhancement, unique resonance spectral pattern, and an advanced analysis based on vibrational functions of the ground and excited electronic state. For the first time, a dual circular polarization signal coming from asymmetric molecular polarizabilities was verified on enantiomers.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra with high sensitivity reveal details on molecular structure, chirality, and excited electronic properties. Despite the difficulty of the measurements, the recorded data for the Co(III) complex with S,S&#8208;N,N&#8208;ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid are of exceptional quality and, coupled with the theory, spectacularly document the molecular behavior in resonance. This includes a huge enhancement of the chiral scattering, contribution of the antisymmetric polarizabilities to the signal, and the Herzberg&#8208;Teller effect significantly shaping the spectra. The chiral component is by about one order of magnitude bigger than for an analogous aluminum complex. The band assignment and intensity profile were confirmed by simulations based on density functional and vibronic theories. The resonance was attributed to the S0&#8594;S3 transition, with the strongest signal enhancement of Raman and ROA spectral bands below about 800&#8197;cm&#8722;1. For higher wavenumbers, other excited electronic states contribute to the scattering in a less resonant way. RROA spectroscopy thus appears as a unique tool to study the structure and electronic states of absorbing molecules in analytical chemistry, biology, and material science.

         <title>A High Pressure Operando Spectroscopy Examination of Bimetal Interactions in &#8216;Metal Efficient&#8217; Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando spectroscopy under CO2 hydrogenation conditions reveals the importance of catalyst design in a metal&#8208;efficient Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. Concurrent X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Pd and In, combined with infrared techniques reveals the roles of the two metals, relating them to the catalytic mechanism with vital insights for future multimetallic catalyst development.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has the potential to serve as a sustainable route to a wide variety of hydrocarbons, fuels and plastics in the quest for net zero. Synergistic Pd/In2O3 (Palldium on Indium Oxide) catalysts show high CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, enhancing methanol yield. The identity of the optimal active site for this reaction is unclear, either as a Pd&#8722;In alloy, proximate metals, or distinct sites. In this work, we demonstrate that metal&#8208;efficient Pd/In2O3 species dispersed on Al2O3 can match the performance of pure Pd/In2O3 systems. Further, we follow the evolution of both Pd and In sites, and surface species, under operando reaction conditions using X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscpy (XAS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In doing so, we can determine both the nature of the active sites and the influence on the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Vinylindole Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylation of 1&#8208;Alkynylindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. A wide variety of vinylindole atropisomers were synthesized in excellent regioselectivity, stereoselectivity (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Moreover, the enantioselective hydroarylation of alkynes using organoboron reagents has not been reported. Herein, we report for the first time that palladium compounds can catalyze the hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers. A series of rarely reported vinylindole atropisomers was synthesized with excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The ready availability of organoborons and alkynes and the simplicity, high stereoselectivity, and good functional group tolerance of this catalytic system make it highly attractive.

         <title>Highly Uniform DNA Monolayers Generated by Freezing&#8208;Directed Assembly on Gold Surfaces Enable Robust Electrochemical Sensing in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing a droplet containing DNA on gold surfaces gives rise to a uniform DNA monolayer with vertically standing up and laterally separated conformations. Compared to DNA surfaces obtained by traditional methods, the freezing&#8208;induced surface is remarkably stable over electrochemical interrogation and long&#8208;term storage. The uniform conformation increases the binding affinity of DNA by over 40&#8208;fold and enhances the antifouling performance in undiluted whole blood.







Abstract
Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.

         <title>Temporal Regulation of PET&#8208;RAFT Controlled Radical Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise temporal control under visible irradiation has been achieved through a photocatalytic RAFT chemical recycling methodology. Depolymerization could be easily initiated by switching &#8220;on&#8221; the light, whereas negligible monomer regeneration was observed in the dark. This outstanding characteristic was possible by fine regulation of the deactivation of the depropagating chain and by finally suppressing thermal initiation of the chains.







Abstract
A photocatalytic RAFT&#8208;controlled radical depolymerization method is introduced for precisely conferring temporal control under visible light irradiation. By regulating the deactivation of the depropagating chains and suppressing thermal initiation, an excellent temporal control was enabled, exemplified by several consecutive &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; cycles. Minimal, if any, depolymerization could be observed during the dark periods while the polymer chain&#8208;ends could be efficiently re&#8208;activated and continue to depropagate upon re&#8208;exposure to light. Notably, favoring deactivation resulted in the gradual unzipping of polymer chains and a stepwise decrease in molecular weight over time.

     alt="Temporal Regulation of PET-RAFT Controlled Radical Depolymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise temporal control under visible irradiation has been achieved through a photocatalytic RAFT chemical recycling methodology. Depolymerization could be easily initiated by switching &#8220;on&#8221; the light, whereas negligible monomer regeneration was observed in the dark. This outstanding characteristic was possible by fine regulation of the deactivation of the depropagating chain and by finally suppressing thermal initiation of the chains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic RAFT-controlled radical depolymerization method is introduced for precisely conferring temporal control under visible light irradiation. By regulating the deactivation of the depropagating chains and suppressing thermal initiation, an excellent temporal control was enabled, exemplified by several consecutive &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; cycles. Minimal, if any, depolymerization could be observed during the dark periods while the polymer chain-ends could be efficiently re-activated and continue to depropagate upon re-exposure to light. Notably, favoring deactivation resulted in the gradual unzipping of polymer chains and a stepwise decrease in molecular weight over time. This synthetic approach constitutes a simple methodology to modulate temporal control during the chemical recycling of RAFT-synthesized polymers while offering invaluable mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts: Human&#8208; and AI&#8208;Driven Platform for Augmented Designs, Analytics and Reality&#8208;Enabled Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the opportunities offered by metal&#8211;organic frameworks for the selective gas&#8208;phase CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. Emphasis is provided to illustrate their flexibility in design and synthesis to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes, the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity to determine the activity and selectivity are also discussed.







Abstract
Large scale production of green CH3OH obtained from CO2 and green H2 is a highly wanted process due to the role of CH3OH as H2/energy carrier and for producing chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, particularly for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH that frequently ranges from 250 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. The existing literature in this area is briefly organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles (NPs). Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have also been highlighted.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Fluoroaroylation for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis is reported.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre&#8208;functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted ketones. A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.

Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre-functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted ketones. A wide variety of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono- or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evoking Ferroptosis by Synergistic Enhancement of a Cyclopentadienyl Iridium&#8208;Betulin Immune Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy was used to develop an immune agonist Ir&#8208;Bet composed of an iridium complex fused with the natural product Betulin, which induced ferritinophagy&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. The MLSE strategy not only promotes effective ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also provides a new mechanism of action for metal&#8208;based anticancer complexes for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with the potential for antitumor immunity activation. In this study, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal&#8208;based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir&#8208;Bet) was developed by a metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy involving the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2Cl2 with the natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir&#8208;Cp*) species as Ir&#8208;Bet not only tremendously enhanced the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activated ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evoked an immune response by nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation of Ir&#8208;Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurred by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. An in vivo vaccination experiment demonstrated desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects of Ir&#8208;Bet by increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/regulatory T cells (Tregs).

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst, which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional selectivity (96.0&#8201;%) and an impressive turnover frequency (2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1) in the reduction of O2 to water. These outstanding catalytic properties are attributed to the collaborative efforts of copper and iron, as they work together to efficiently break the O&#8722;O bond via the CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII intermediate.







Abstract
We report herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8722;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1 and selectivity of 96.0&#8201;% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 of CuCu&#8722;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9&#8201;%, and inactive of FeFe&#8722;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8722;O bond cleavage via a CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinating and electronic character. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.

         <title>Subrutilane&#8212;A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining uncovered a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus that produces the first known hexacyclic sesterterpene with no double bonds as the main product, as well as eight pentacyclic products. Isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations revealed a cyclisation cascade via several well&#8208;stabilised secondary cations. The enzyme also converted several substrate analogues into sesterterpenoid compounds.







Abstract
Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure, including the absolute configuration, was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogues (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with blocked reactivity at the C6&#8722;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogues were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.

Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific opening by the pendant nucleophile.

The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile.

Access to enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides in good to high levels of enantiomeric excess was achieved using a chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst. Experimental results together with DFT calculations support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process, whose efficiency is impacted by developing steric interactions in the syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate complexes.







Abstract
Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters using distinct organometallic reagents has been developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that unique chelation patterns are essential in determining selectivity. This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated with coupling reactions through radical mechanisms, which commonly yield the classical products reacting through stable radical species.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8722;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.

         <dc:description>
An artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase was constructed by anchoring an editable organic cofactor to the proximal position of the heme center of P450BM3 as a co&#8208;catalytic center. This provides an unprecedented approach for assembling artificial metalloenzymes and substantially increases the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, as described by Longyi Jin, Zhiqi Cong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311259).

         <title>Accessing Ta/Cu Architectures via Metal&#8208;Metal Salt Metatheses: Heterobimetallic C&#8722;H Bond Activation Affords &#956;&#8208;Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;free metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis protocol facilitates heteromultimetallic complex formation. Bridging hydride ligands, originating from both an arene C&#8722;H activation event and H&#8208;atom transfer from solvent, stabilize unusual Cu&#8722;Ta bimetallics. These complexes are suitable platforms for subsequent metathesis chemistry, affording a tetranuclear complex featuring a highly reduced TaCu3 cluster.







Abstract
We employ a metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis strategy to access low&#8208;valent tantalum&#8208;copper heterometallic architectures (Ta&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu and Ta&#8722;&#956;3&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu3) that emulate structural elements proposed for surface alloyed nanomaterials. Whereas cluster assembly with carbonylmetalates is well precedented, the use of the corresponding polyarene transition metal anions is underexplored, despite recognition of these highly reactive fragments as storable sources of atomic Mn&#8722;. Our application of this strategy provides structurally unique early&#8208;late bimetallic species. These complexes incorporate bridging hydride ligands during their syntheses, the origin of which is elucidated via detailed isotopic labelling studies. Modification of ancillary ligand sterics and electronics alters the mechanism of bimetallic assembly; a trinuclear complex resulting from dinuclear C&#8722;H activation is demonstrated as an intermediate en route to formation of the bimetallic. Further validating the promise of this rational, bottom&#8208;up approach, a unique tetranuclear species was synthesized, featuring a Ta centre bearing three Ta&#8722;Cu interactions.

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of GX fluorophores have been designed and synthesized as activatable NIR&#8208;II PA dyes, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by CO was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as an activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Importantly, the GX dyes have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of GX dyes will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In general, two&#8208;component catalysts containing Lewis pairs are inferior to one&#8208;component ones due to the lack of intramolecular synergy. A silicon&#8208;centered bimolecular catalyst has been developed that exhibits a rare higher activity than its unimolecular analogue, even at low loadings. A unique two&#8208;path initiation mode was proposed to explain its exceptional catalytic performance in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide.







Abstract
This work reported that a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane/ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3&#8197;times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, and even 15.3&#8197;times the activity at an extremely low loading of 0.002&#8197;mol&#8201;%. By using 19F NMR spectroscopy, control experiments, and theoretical calculation we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity of the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity because of the increase in entropy.

         <title>Pushing Up the Size Limit of Boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;Acenes: Modular Synthesis and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA, B&#8208;[4,3]PA and B&#8208;[7,2]PA derivatives. This study not only enriches the scope of the [n,m]PA family but also provides a straightforward strategy of boron incorporation into zigzag edges of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which also enables precise modification of their physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) have recently attracted considerable attention considering their fascinating physical properties and chemical stability. However, the precise sole addition of boron atoms along the zigzag edges of PAs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited synthetic approach. Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped PAs (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA (1&#8201;a&#8208;2), B&#8208;[4,3]PA (1&#8201;b&#8208;2) and B&#8208;[7,2]PA (1&#8201;c&#8208;3) derivatives, through efficient intramolecular electrophilic borylation. Their chemical structures are unequivocally confirmed with a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, 1&#8201;b&#8208;2 exhibits an almost planar geometry, whereas 1&#8201;a&#8208;2 displays a distinctive bowl&#8208;like distortion. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of this series of B&#8208;PAs are thoroughly investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DFT calculation. Compared with their parent all&#8208;carbon analogs, the obtained B&#8208;PAs exhibit high stability, wide energy gaps, and high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 84&#8201;%. This study reveals the exceptional ability of boron doping to finely tune the physicochemical properties of PAs, showcasing their potential applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of oxidosqualene cyclase from Tripterygium wilfordii (TwOSC) was determined. This enzyme promotes a multistep cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade reaction to generate diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid skeletons. QM/MM simulations were performed and key residues identified to reveal the CSR mechanism. Semirational design of TwOSC was then carried out to promote friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to form diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade rearrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed at C2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C3 to yield a friedelin cation, which is finally deprotonated. However, as crystal structure data of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions occur in friedelin biosynthesis, as does the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton formation. Furthermore, we semirationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Homoleptic Diphosphene Lead Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic diphosphene lead complex was synthesized through controllable degradation of P4 by a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized plumbylone which possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions. The diphosphene lead complex exhibits intriguing reactivity involving the delivery of Pb(0) to perform redox reaction with iminoquinone thus producing a cyclic plumbylene and undergoing a NHC&#8208;induced two&#8208;step phosphorus cation abstraction reaction.







Abstract
Due to their limited capacity for &#960;&#8208;backdonation, isolation of &#960;&#8208;complexes of main&#8208;group elements remains a great challenge. We report herein the synthesis of a homoleptic diphosphene lead complex (2) from the degradation of P4 with a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized Pb(0) complex. Structural and computational studies showed that 2 possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions between Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, which is reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal diphosphene complexes. Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex 2 can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (4) and perform 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene (IMe2Me2) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP3 complex (6).

         <title>Encapsulation of Palladium Carbide Subnanometric Species in Zeolite Boosts Highly Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subnanometric Pd carbide species are encapsulated in MFI zeolite via a carbonization&#8208;reduction method. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The generated carbon species modulate both the Pd species and zeolite support, facilitating alkene desorption and thus leading to superior alkene selectivity.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a crucial step in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the widely utilized palladium (Pd)&#8208;based catalysts often suffer from poor selectivity. In this work, we demonstrate a carbonization&#8208;reduction method to create palladium carbide subnanometric species within pure silicate MFI zeolite. The carbon species can modify the electronic and steric characteristics of Pd species by forming the predominant Pd&#8722;C4 structure and, meanwhile, facilitate the desorption of alkenes by forming the Si&#8722;O&#8722;C structure with zeolite framework, as validated by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations and theoretical calculations. The developed catalyst shows superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), with 99&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at a complete conversion of phenylacetylene. In contrast, the zeolite&#8208;encapsulated carbon&#8208;free Pd catalyst and the commercial Lindlar catalyst show only 15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;% selectivity to styrene, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. The zeolite&#8208;confined Pd&#8208;carbide subnanoclusters promise their superior properties in semihydrogenation of alkynes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote&#8208;controlled manipulation of biological processes is meaningful but challenging. Herein we report the development of near infrared light photocatalytic decaging chemistry (CAT&#8208;NIR) for on&#8208;demand fluorescence activation and drug release in living cells. We also achieved protein rescue and in vivo prodrug activation by taking advantages of the decaging chemistry and the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of the NIR light.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a captivating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740&#8197;nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT&#8208;NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Protein Conformation Transistor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful acquisition of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structural protein nanocrystals that undergo ultrafast cross&#8208;linking behavior in response to pH levels above 7.6 illustrate the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. This pH&#8208;responsive cross&#8208;linking can be conveniently achieved under near physiological conditions, highlighting the great potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.







Abstract
Analogous to electronic transistors, transistor&#8208;like responsive materials undergo sharp structural transitions in response to a very narrow range of microenvironment signals. This kind of material is typically limited to synthetic polymer&#8208;derived nanoscale assembly or disassembly and has profound implications for modern high&#8208;tech applications. Herein, we evolve this system from synthetic polymers to biopolymers and extend the corresponding assembly scale from the nanoscale to meso/macro&#8208;scale. We develop unique protein nanocrystals with core&#8211;shell structures through a two&#8208;step nucleation process. The protein nanocrystals exhibit exceptional transistor&#8208;like pH&#8208;responsive mesoscale assembly through the formation of inter&#8208;particle &#946;&#8208;sheet linkers. This allows ultrasensitive cross&#8208;linking behavior, such as self&#8208;coacervation at a water/water interface, ultrafast gelation in seconds, and ultrasensitive swelling for detection of basic vapors at extremely low concentrations. This breakthrough has great promise for broader applications such as drug encapsulation and delivery, biosensing, cytomimetic materials, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular approach has been developed to inhibit the undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of cyanine dyes. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, the resulting supra&#8208;cyanines exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in both solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, and exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 50&#8201;%) in both solution and in the solid state. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination molecular recognition strategy is proposed to precisely regulate the local coordination structure of single&#8208;atom sites. Specifically, utilizing five&#8208;membered heterocycle molecules as the ligands, the coordination interaction between the guest&#8208;host molecules induces molecular recognition and ensures further precise settlement of the heteroatoms into the local coordination structure of the metal atoms in the single&#8208;atom sites.







Abstract
Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.

         <title>Polymer Photocatalysts Containing Segregated &#960;&#8208;Conjugation Units with Electron&#8208;Trap Activity for Efficient Natural&#8208;light&#8208;driven Bacterial Inactivation</title>

         <dc:description>
Discontinuously conjugated photocatalysts with electron trap are effective for natural light&#8208;induced bacteria inactivation. A low&#8208;toxicity photocatalyst with an electron&#8208;trap was actively assembled using by ethylenediamine and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride via a bottom&#8208;up acidification strategy. The obtained material (EDA&#8208;PTDA) exhibited a superior performance for photocatalytic antibacterial under natural light.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9&#8201;% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45&#8197;min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.

         <title>Guaiacol as an Organic Superoxide Dismutase Mimics for Anti&#8208;ageing a Ru&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guaiacol as an organic superoxide dismutase mimics scavenged superoxide radicals via disproportionation by chelating lithium superoxide on its two functional groups. Additionally, guaiacol formed homogeneously thin polymeric cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability. Resultantly, guaiacol successfully anti&#8208;aged lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich layered oxides using oxygen redox as well as transition metal redox suffer from its structural instability due to lattice oxygen escaped from its structure during oxygen redox and the following electrolyte decomposition by the reactive oxygen species. Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel amino&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts were obtained through SNAr with o&#8208;fluoro&#8208;diaryliodonium salts. A sequential arylation/ring opening pathway with external nucleophiles allows for transition metal&#8208;free skeletal diversification of cyclic amines to provide a wide variety of complex diarylamines with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. The strategy proved efficient also in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8722;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation is a sustainable tool for introducing important vicinal diol&#8208;related structures in alkenes. The scuba divers in the cover picture perform the highly efficient diacetoxylation of alkenes using renewable electricity as the driving force, as reported by Dirk De&#8197;Vos and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311539). Excellent yields are obtained with a wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes in an atom&#8208;efficient and versatile protocol, with also application to lactone synthesis.

         <title>Expanding the Range of Bioorthogonal Tags for Multiplex Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy with spectral phasor analysis enables the multiplex detection of bioorthogonal Raman groups in cells. Unmixing of the overlapping alkyne and deuterium signals together with the detection of metallacarboranes is reported within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum.







Abstract
Multiplex optical detection in live cells is challenging due to overlapping signals and poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise associated with some chemical reporters. To address this, the application of spectral phasor analysis to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for unmixing three bioorthogonal Raman probes within cells is reported. Triplex detection of a metallacarborane using the B&#8722;H stretch at 2480&#8211;2650&#8197;cm&#8722;1, together with a bis&#8208;alkyne and deuterated fatty acid can be achieved within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum. When coupled to imaging in the high&#8208;wavenumber region of the cellular Raman spectrum, nine discrete regions of interest can be spectrally unmixed from the hyperspectral SRS dataset, demonstrating a new capability in the toolkit of multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells.

         <dc:description>
The location of Pd nanoparticles relative to a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs, resulting in distinctly different product selectivity in the direct CO esterification. Moreover, the electronic state of Pd nanoparticles in Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X can be optimized by modulating Pd microenvironment with alterable X groups on the MOF linker toward improved activity, as reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311265).

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry PdnL2n  Nanocages through Coordination&#8208;Sphere Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are popular host architectures assembled from ligands and metal ions/nodes. Assembling structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry MOCs with anisotropic cavities can be limited by the formation of statistical isomer libraries. We set out to investigate the use of primary coordination&#8208;sphere engineering (CSE) to bias isomer selectivity within homo&#8208; and heteroleptic PdnL2n cages. Unexpected differences in selectivities between alternative donor groups led us to recognise the significant impact of the second coordination sphere on isomer stabilities. From this, molecular&#8208;level insight into the origins of selectivity between cis and trans diastereoisomers was gained, highlighting the importance of both host&#8208;guest and host&#8208;solvent interactions, in addition to ligand design. This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low&#8208;symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, shape&#8208;shifting MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enables Efficient Pure Red Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With increasing ecological and environmental concerns, tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are competitive candidates for future displays because of their environmental friendliness, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. Nonetheless, their electroluminescence (EL) performance still lags behind that of lead (Pb)&#8208;based PeLEDs due to the fast crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and undesired oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to poor film morphology and coverage, as well as high density defects. Here, we propose a ligand engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;quality phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA2SnI4) perovskite films by using L&#8208;glutathione reduced (GSH) as surface ligands toward efficient pure red PEA2SnI4&#8208;based PeLEDs. We show that the hydrogen&#8208;bond and coordinate interactions between GSH and PEA2SnI4 effectively reduce the crystallization rate of the perovskites and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and formation of defects. The improved pure red perovskite films not only show excellent uniformity, density, and coverage but also exhibit enhanced optical properties and stability. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 9.32% in the field of PEA2SnI4&#8208;based devices. This work demonstrates that ligand engineering represents a feasible route to enhance the EL performance of Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near&#8208;zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO4]2&#8208; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8208; with anisotropic &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8208;O&#8208;Org (Org: &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3&#8208;C5H4NSO3)&#183;xH2O (A = Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH4; x = 0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546 nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate&#8208;related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallizing Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast Proton Transport in Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) display great potential to be assembled into proton conductive membranes for their uniform and controllable pore structure, yet constructing self&#8208;standing COF membrane with high crystallinity to fully exploit their ordered crystalline channels for efficient ionic conduction remains a great challenge. Here, a macromolecular&#8208;mediated crystallization strategy is designed to manipulate the crystallization of self&#8208;standing COF membrane, where the &#8208;SO3H groups in introduced sulfonated macromolecule chains function as the sites to interact with the precursors of COF and thus offer long&#8208;range ordered template for membrane crystallization. The optimized self&#8208;standing COF membrane composed of highly&#8208;ordered nanopores exhibits high proton conductivity (72.9 mS cm&#8208;1 at 100% relative humidity and 20 &#176;C) and excellent flow battery performance, outperforming Nafion 212 and reported membranes. Meanwhile, the long&#8208;term run of membrane is achieved through the anchoring effect of flexible macromolecule chains. Our work provides inspiration to design self&#8208;standing COF membranes with ordered channels for permselective application.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent and Photoredox&#8208;Active Molybdenum(0) Complexes Competitive with Isoelectronic Ruthenium(II) Polypyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero&#8208;valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited&#8208;state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero-valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited-state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range. The molybdenum(0) complexes are stronger photoreductants than ruthenium(II) polypyridines and can therefore perform more challenging chemical reductions.

         <title>Hydrogenation Catalysis by Hydrogen Spillover on Platinum&#8208;Functionalized Heterogeneous Boronic Acid&#8208;Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H2 by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron&#8208;proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid&#8208;state, the compounds are held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions (&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface&#8208;functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in&#8208;situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1 bar H2 and room temperature).</dc:description>

         <title>Favoring CO Intermediate Stabilization and Protonation by Crown Ether for CO2 Electromethanation in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large&#8208;scale deployment of CO2 electroreduction is hampered by deficient carbon utilization in neutral and alkaline electrolytes due to CO2 loss into (bi)carbonates, while switching to acidic media mitigate carbonation but suffers from low product selectivity because of hydrogen evolution. Here we report a crown ether decoration strategy on Cu catalyst to enhance carbon utilization and selectivity of CO2 methanation under acidic condition. Macrocyclic 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 is found to enrich potassium cations near Cu electrode surface, simultaneously enhancing the interfacial electric field to stabilize *CO intermediate and accelerating water dissociation to boost *CO protonation. Remarkably, the mixture of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and Cu nanoparticles affords a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.2% and a single pass carbon efficiency of 43.0% toward CO2 electroreduction in electrolyte with pH = 2. This study provides a facile strategy to promote CH4 selectivity and carbon utilization by modifying Cu catalysts with supramolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensional and Optoelectronic Tuning of Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Cs3Bi2I9&#8211;nBrn Single Crystals for Enhanced Hard X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic Bi&#8208;based perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection for their large absorption to X&#8208;rays, diverse low&#8208;dimensional structures, and eco&#8208;friendliness without toxic metals. However, they suffer from poor carrier transport properties compared to Pb&#8208;based perovskites. Here, we propose a mixed&#8208;halogen strategy to tune the structural dimensions and optoelectronic properties of Cs3Bi2I9&#8211;nBrn (0&#8804;n&#8804;9). Ten centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman technique. Upon doping bromine to zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9, the crystal transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional structure as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. Correspondingly, the optoelectronic properties are adjusted. Among these crystals, Cs3Bi2I8Br exhibits negligible ion migration, moderate resistivity and the best carrier transport capability. The sensitivities in 100 keV hard X&#8208;ray detection are 1.33 &#215; 104 and 1.74 &#215; 104 &#956;C Gyair&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at room temperature and 75 &#176;C, respectively, which are the highest among all reported bismuth perovskites. Moreover, the lowest detection limit of 28.64 nGyair s&#8211;1 and ultralow dark current drift of 9.12 &#215; 10&#8211;9 nA cm&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 are obtained owing to the high ionic activation energy. Our work demonstrates that Br incorporation is an effective strategy to enhance the X&#8208;ray detection performance by tuning the dimensional and optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Responsive Flexible Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of flexible, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials remains challenging owing to the quenching of their unstable triplet excitons via molecular motion. Therefore, a polymer matrix with Tg higher than room temperature is required to prevent polymer segment movement. In this study, a RTP material was developed by incorporating a 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid (BPBA) phosphor into a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix (Tg = &#8722;27.1 &#176;C), which exhibits a remarkable UV&#8208;light&#8208;dependent oxygen consumption phosphorescence with a lifetime of 1275.7 ms. The adjustable RTP performance is influenced by the crystallinity and polymorph (&#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases) fraction of PVDF, therefore, the low Tg of the PVDF matrix enables the polymeric segmental motion upon microwave irradiation. Consequently, a reduction in the crystallinity and an increase in the a phase fraction in PVDF film induces RTP after 2.45 GHz microwave irradiation. These findings open up new avenues for constructing crystalline and phase&#8208;dependent RTP materials while demonstrating a promising approach toward microwave detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Solvent Effect on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered as an ideal electrolyte system for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their superior compatibility with the sodium metal anode (SMA). However, the selection principle of ether solvents and the impact on solid electrolyte interphase formation are still unclear. Herein, we systematically compare the chain ether&#8208;based electrolyte and understand the relationship between the solvation structure and the interphasial properties. The linear ether solvent molecules with different terminal group lengths demonstrate remarkably distinct solvation effects, thus leading to different electrochemical performance as well as deposition morphologies for SMBs. Computational calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the terminal group length significantly regulates the electrolyte solvation structure and consequently influences the interfacial reaction mechanism of electrolytes on SMA. Cryogenic electron microscopy clearly reveals the difference in solid electrolyte interphase in various ether&#8208;based electrolytes. As a result, the 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%, which also realizes the stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a mass loading of ~9 mg cm&#8208;2 over 500 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Gene&#8208;Editable Palladium&#8208;Based Bioorthogonal Nanoplatform Facilitates Macrophage Phagocytosis for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells has emerged as an attractive strategy for tumor therapy. Nevertheless, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and the high expression of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals from tumor cells impede therapeutic efficacy. To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system&#8208;linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton&#8208;like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane&#8208;associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein, represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.</dc:description>

To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene-editable palladium-based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system-linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor-targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton-like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein, represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of energy&#8208;saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by Fe4L6 cage in a water solution was documented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The binding constants K for the Fe4L6 cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0 &#177; 0.1) &#215; 103 M&#8208;1 and (2.1 &#177; 0.7) &#215; 104 M&#8208;1 in D2O at 25 &#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer&#8208;grade propylene (&gt;99.5%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe4L6 cage as a separation material in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.</dc:description>

         <title>Significant Strain Dissipation via Stiff&#8208;Tough Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Highly Stable Alloying Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pulverization of alloying anodes significantly restricts their use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This study presents a dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that incorporates finely dispersed Al nanoparticles within the LiPON matrix. This distinctive dual&#8208;phase structure imparts high stiffness and toughness to the integrated SEI film. In comparison to single&#8208;phase LiPON film, the optimized Al/LiPON dual&#8208;phase SEI film demonstrates a remarkable increase in fracture toughness by 317.8%, while maintaining stiffness, achieved through the substantial dissipation of strain energy. Application of the dual&#8208;phase SEI film on an Al anode leads to a 450% enhancement in cycling stability for lithium storage in dual&#8208;ion batteries. A similar enhancement in cycling stability for silicon anodes, which face severe volume expansion issues, is also observed, demonstrating the broad applicability of the dual&#8208;phase SEI design. Specifically, homogeneous Li&#8208;Al alloying has been observed in conventional LIBs, even when paired with a high mass loading LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode (7 mg cm&#8211;2). The dual&#8208;phase SEI film design can also accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Li&#8208;ions through interface electronic structure regulation. This dual&#8208;phase design can integrate stiffness and toughness into a single SEI film, providing a pathway to enhance both the structural stability and rate capability of alloying anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of M8Pd6 Supramolecular Cages Based on Metal&#8208;Center Lability for Differential Chiral Induction, Resolution and Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural supramolecular cages in rhombic dodecahedron shape have been assembled with distinct metal&#8208;coordination lability (M8Pd6&#8208;MOC&#8208;16, M = Ru2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+). The chirality transfer between metal&#8208;centers generally imposes homochirality on individual cages to lead to solvent&#8208;dependent spontaneous resolution of &#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;M8Pd6 enantiomers; however, their distinguishable stereochemical dynamics manifests differential chiral phenomena governed by the cage stability following the order of Ru8Pd6 &gt; Ni8Pd6 &gt; Fe8Pd6 &gt; Zn8Pd6. The highly labile Zn&#8208;centers endow Zn8Pd6 cage with conformational flexibility and deformation, enabling intrigue chiral&#8208;&#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;Zn8Pd6 to meso&#8208;&#916;4&#923;4&#8208;Zn8Pd6 transition induced by anions. The cage stabilization effect differs from inert Ru2+ to metastable Fe2+/Ni2+ and labile Zn2+, resulting in different chiral&#8208;guest induction. Strikingly, solvent&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest interactions have been revealed for &#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;(Ru/Ni/Fe)8Pd6 cages to discriminate the chiral recognition of the guests with opposite chirality. These results demonstrate a versatile protocol to control the stereochemistry of MOCs based on the dynamic metal&#8208;centers, providing a guidance to maneuver cage chirality at a supramolecular level by virtue of solvent, anion and guest to benefit practical applications.</dc:description>
