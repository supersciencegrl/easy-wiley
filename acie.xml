         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl alkyl thioethers are an underutilized class of alkyl radical precursors that are demonstrated to outperform their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues under electroreductive conditions. Single electron transfer results in C&#8722;S bond cleavage and alkyl radicals that may react in C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond forming events or undergo radical&#8208;polar crossover, followed by protonation or carboxylation to furnish alkanes or arylacetic acids.







Abstract
Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class. In this vein, electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A (3+2) annulation reaction has been used to synthesize diazulenorubicenes (DARs), non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings. These compounds show red&#8208;shifted absorptions, low LUMO energies, aromaticity switching, and high charge mobilities up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, on&#8208;surface synthesis with the DAR compounds leads to large non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized by a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes, and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2&#8201;b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19&#8197;rings was achieved through on&#8208;surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.

         <title>Template&#8208;Oriented Polyaniline&#8208;Supported Palladium Nanoclusters for Reductive Homocoupling of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pd/PANI catalysts with tunable morphologies and structures was prepared by using crystalline MnO2 as a sacrificial template. The various oxidation states of the support and the coordination modes of metal in the Pd/PANI catalysts led to differences in metal dispersion and electron structure. The most electron&#8208;rich Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI nanocluster catalyst showed the highest TOF for reductive coupling to afford a bifuran ester as a bio&#8208;plasticizer with extremely low migration resistance.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined structures and desired properties for porous organic polymer (POP) supported catalysts by controlling their composition, size, and morphology is of great significance. Herein, we report a preparation of polyaniline (PANI) supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable structure and morphology. The protocol involves the introduction of MnO2 with different crystal structures (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;) serving as both the reaction template and the oxidant. The different forms of MnO2 each convert aniline to a PANI that contains a unique regular distribution of benzene and quinone. This leads to the Pd/PANI catalysts with different charge transfer properties between Pd and PANI, as well as different dispersions of the metal NPs. In this case, the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst greatly improves the turnover frequency (TOF; to 88.3&#8197;h&#8722;1), in the reductive coupling of furfural derivatives to potential bio&#8208;based plasticizers. Systematic characterizations reveal the unique oxidation state of the support in the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst and coordination mode of Pd that drives the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoclusters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the more electron rich Pd/PANI catalyst has the lower energy barrier in the oxidative addition step, which favors the C&#8722;C coupling reaction.

         <title>Stabilizing Solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries through In Situ Generated Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF&#8208;rich SEI in Ionic Liquid Confined 3D MOF/Polymer Membranes</title>

         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.







Abstract
Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes, showing superior room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transfer number of 0.82. The cryo&#8208;TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li3N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.

Such a 3D-Janus SEI-incorporated into the separator offers fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport routes, showing superior room-temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer number of 0.82. The cryo-TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid-state Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li||NCM-811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate-performance and ultra-long life spans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into the Carbon&#8208;Iodine Bond of Heteroaryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed aryne insertion into heteroaryl C&#8722;I bonds to access valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls, characterized by high efficiency and selectivity, has first been realized. The newly discovered Lewis acid catalyzed insertion model opens up numerous opportunities for the further development of aryne chemistry.







Abstract
Aryne insertions into the carbon&#8208;iodine bond of heteroaryl iodides has been achieved for the first time. This novel reaction provides an efficient pathway for the synthesis of valuable building blocks 2&#8208;iodoheterobiaryls from heteroaryl iodides and o&#8208;silylaryl triflates in excellent regioselectivity. The copper(I) catalyst, which bears a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, is essential to accomplish the reaction. Control reactions and DFT calculations indicate that the coordination of copper, as a Lewis acid, with nitrogen atoms of heteroaryl iodides mediates the insertion of arynes into heteroaryl carbon&#8208;iodine bonds.

         <title>Versatile Post&#8208;synthetic Modifications of Helical &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers Derived from a Thioether&#8208;Containing Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of &#946;&#8208;peptides containing cyclic thioether side chains adopted a 12&#8208;helical conformation, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR, and circular dichroism. Post&#8208;synthetic modifications, such as oxidation, desulfurization, and notably chemoselective conjugation, highlighted the unique potential of the methionine&#8208;like building block for diverse applications in peptidomimetic systems.







Abstract
We introduce a novel cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC), as a versatile building block for designing peptide foldamers with controlled secondary structures. We synthesized and characterized a series of &#946;&#8208;peptide hexamers containing ATTC using various techniques, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that ATTC&#8208;containing foldamers can adopt 12&#8208;helical conformations similar to their isosteres and offer the possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their properties via post&#8208;synthetic modifications. In particular, chemoselective conjugation strategies demonstrate that ATTC provides unique post&#8208;synthetic modification opportunities, which expand their potential applications across diverse research areas. Collectively, our study highlights the versatility and utility of ATTC as an alternative to previously reported cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks in both structural and functional aspects, paving the way for future research in the realm of peptide foldamers and beyond.

         <title>Synergic Electron and Defect Compensation Minimizes Voltage Loss in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergic electron and defect compensation on Sn perovskites has been realized via alloying heterovalent metal halide salts. This concurrently optimized the interfacial carrier dynamics, compensated the prevailing vacancy defects and minimized the nonradiative recombination loss throughout the devices, thus affording best efficiency up to 14.02&#8201;% characterized by a record high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V and the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;V.







Abstract
Sn perovskite solar cells have been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the Sn perovskites are notorious to feature heavy p&#8208;doping characteristics and possess abundant vacancy defects, which result in under&#8208;optimized interfacial energy level alignment and severe nonradiative recombination. Here, we reported a synergic &#8220;electron and defect compensation&#8221; strategy to simultaneously modulate the electronic structures and defect profiles of Sn perovskites via incorporating a traced amount (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of heterovalent metal halide salts. Consequently, the doping level of modified Sn perovskites was altered from heavy p&#8208;type to weak p&#8208;type (i.e. up&#8208;shifting the Fermi level by &#8764;0.12&#8197;eV) that determinately reducing the barrier of interfacial charge extraction and effectively suppressing the charge recombination loss throughout the bulk perovskite film and at relevant interfaces. Pioneeringly, the resultant device modified with electron and defect compensation realized a champion efficiency of 14.02&#8201;%, which is &#8764;46&#8201;% higher than that of control device (9.56&#8201;%). Notably, a record&#8208;high photovoltage of 1.013&#8197;V was attained, corresponding to the lowest voltage deficit of 0.38&#8197;eV reported to date, and narrowing the gap with Pb&#8208;based analogues (&#8764;0.30&#8197;V).

         <title>Myocardial&#8208;Targeting Tannic Cerium Nanocatalyst Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidant properties have been synthesized. The nanocatalysts were used to treat myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, protecting cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage and preserving myocardial functionality.







Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Medications or surgery have been considered as effective protocols to treat IHD for decades. Yet the reperfusion of the blood flow frequently leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing prominent and irreversible damage to the cardiomyocytes. In the present work, tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8722;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidation capability have been synthesized and applied for the effective and biocompatible ischemia/reperfusion injury therapeutics. TA&#8722;Ce nanocatalysts could effectively rescue the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 challenge as well as oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation in vitro. In the murine ischemia/reperfusion model, cardiac accumulation and intracellular ROS scavenging could be achieved against the pathology, substantially reducing the myocardial infarct area and recovering heart functionality. This work illuminates the design of nanocatalytic metal complexes and their therapeutic prospects in ischemic heart diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility, paving the way for the clinical translation from bench to bedside.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pivaloyl chloride as a mild one&#8208;pot copolymerization agent, we successfully constructed a novel class of sulfur&#8208;containing aromatic amide helices. Having an average height of 2.1&#8197;nm, 3.6&#8197;&#197; in cavity diameter and helically arranged S&#8208; and O&#8208;atoms along the inner wall, these nanotubes display highly selective and efficient transmembrane lithium transport, with transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.







Abstract
Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8722;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for Li+ ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with Na+ ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6&#8197;&#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 15.3 and 19.9 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to visualize molecular structures and interactions in a cellulose oligomer assembly. High&#8208;resolution imaging with CO&#8208;modified tips, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers and details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. Comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208; oligomers shows their spontaneous enantioseparation.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8220;material of choice&#8221; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of mechanochemistry enabled the rapid in situ generation of Grignard reagents, thereby overcoming the longstanding limitations of the Magnesium&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction in solution.







Abstract
Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;Si, and C&#8722;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.

         <title>Automated Generation of Microkinetics for Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reactions Considering Correlated Uncertainties
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is used to automatically generate an ensemble of mechanisms for the oxidation of emissions over Pt(111). By sampling energetic parameters from the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional, every generated mechanism corresponds to a different DFT functional. From the broad range of predictions, it is possible to identify microkinetic models that achieve remarkable agreement with experiments.







Abstract
The study presents an ab&#8208;initio based framework for the automated construction of microkinetic mechanisms considering correlated uncertainties in all energetic parameters and estimation routines. 2000 unique microkinetic models were generated within the uncertainty space of the BEEF&#8208;vdW functional for the oxidation reactions of representative exhaust gas emissions from stoichiometric combustion engines over Pt(111) and compared to experiments through multiscale modeling. The ensemble of simulations stresses the importance of considering uncertainties. Within this set of first&#8208;principles&#8208;based models, it is possible to identify a microkinetic mechanism that agrees with experimental data. This mechanism can be traced back to a single exchange&#8208;correlation functional, and it suggests that Pt(111) could be the active site for the oxidation of light hydrocarbons. The study provides a universal framework for the automated construction of reaction mechanisms with correlated uncertainty quantification, enabling a DFT&#8208;constrained microkinetic model optimization for other heterogeneously catalyzed systems.

         <title>Artificial Urinary Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial biomarker probes (AMPro) are developed for noninvasive urinalysis of acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) in murine models. With advantages of high renal clearance and specific detection of graft&#8208;infiltrating immune cells, AMPros noninvasively detected the onset of ARAR as accurately as invasive flow cytometry analysis, and specifically distinguished ARAR from non&#8208;allograft diseases or non&#8208;alloimmune&#8208;specific inflammatory patterns.







Abstract
Acute renal allograft rejection (ARAR) after kidney transplantation associated with reduced graft survival and eventual graft failure is poorly diagnosed in hospitals. Here, we report the development of Artificial bioMarker Probes (AMPros) for sensitive urinalysis of ARAR in murine models. AMPros spontaneously go to the kidneys after systemic administration, specifically react with the prodromal immune biomarkers to activate their near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals to report cell&#8208;mediated rejection, and efficiently undergo renal excretion into urine. Thus, AMPros enable convenient optical urinalysis that detects ARAR prior to histological manifestation of rejection, which is also earlier than current diagnostic methods measuring proinflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte mRNAs. Due to the high kidney specificity, AMPros&#8208;based urinalysis discriminates allograft rejection against other non&#8208;alloimmune specific diseases, which is unattainable by measurement of serological biomarkers. Such a noninvasive and sensitive urine test holds great promise in continuous monitoring of renal allograft conditions at low resource settings for timely clinical interventions.

         <title>Mo&#8722;Ni&#8208;based Heterojunction with Fine&#8208;customized d&#8208;Band Centers for Hydrogen Production Coupled with Benzylamine Electrooxidation in Low Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction was constructed for HER coupled with benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR), where charge transfer causes the upshift of d&#8208;band centers. One side facilitates H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER, the other side favors OH* production from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N to catalyze BAOR effectively. It shows 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and FEs of &gt;99&#8201;% in low alkaline medium.







Abstract
Benzylamine electrooxidation reaction (BAOR) is a promising route to produce value&#8208;added, easy&#8208;separated benzonitrile, and effectively hoist H2 production. However, achieving excellent performance in low alkaline medium is a huge challenge. The performance is intimately correlated with effective coupling of HER and BAOR, which can be achieved by manipulating the d&#8208;electron structure of catalyst to regulate the active species from water. Herein, we constructed a biphasic Mo0.8Ni0.2N&#8722;Ni3N heterojunction for enhanced bifunctional performance toward HER coupled with BAOR by customizing the d&#8208;band centers. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that charge transfer in the heterojunction causes the upshift of the d&#8208;band centers, which one side facilitates to decrease water activation energy and optimize H* adsorption on Mo0.8Ni0.2N for promoting HER activity, the other side favors to more easily produce and adsorb OH* from water for forming NiOOH on Ni3N and optimizing adsorption energy of benzylamine, thus catalyzing BAOR effectively. Accordingly, it shows an industrial current density of 220&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V and high Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;99&#8201;%) for H2 production and converting benzylamine to benzonitrile in 0.1&#8197;M KOH/0.5&#8197;M Na2SO4. This work guides the design of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for the scalable production of green hydrogen and value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Phase Separation of DNA&#8208;Encoded Artificial Cells Boosts Signal Amplification for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell system, characterized by robust signal amplification through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and adaptable recognition patterns via molecular engineering is reported. The system is shown to function as a versatile, ultrasensitive biosensor.







Abstract
Life&#8208;like hierarchical architecture shows great potential for advancing intelligent biosensing, but modular expansion of its sensitivity and functionality remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from intracellular liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, we discovered that a DNA&#8208;encoded artificial cell with a liquid core (LAC) can enhance peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Hemin and its DNA G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer complex (DGAH) without substrate&#8208;selectivity, unlike its gelled core (GAC) counterpart. The LAC is easily engineered as an ultrasensitive biosensing system, benefiting from DNA&#8242;s high programmability and unique signal amplification capability mediated by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. As proof of concept, its versatility was successfully demonstrated by coupling with two molecular recognition elements to monitor tumor&#8208;related microRNA and profile cancer cell phenotypes. This scalable design philosophy offers new insights into the design of next generation of artificial cells&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive PROTACs for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized caging strategy has been developed to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs. By leveraging pathological cues or external stimuli, we realized selective protein degradation and potent tumor remission in vitro and in vivo, making our caging library a promising tool in designing activatable prodrugs and smart biomaterials.







Abstract
Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) represent a promising therapeutic modality to address undruggable and resistant issues in drug discovery. However, potential on&#8208;target toxicity remains clinically challenging. We developed a generalized caging strategy to synthesize a series of stimuli&#8208;responsive PROTACs (sr&#8208;PROTACs) with diverse molecular blocks bearing robust and cleavable linkers, presenting &#8220;turn on&#8221; features in manipulating protein degradation. By leveraging pathological cues, such as elevated ROS, phosphatase, H2S, or hypoxia, and external triggers, such as ultraviolet light, X&#8208;Ray, or bioorthogonal reagents, we achieved site&#8208;specific activation and traceless release of original PROTACs through de&#8208;caging and subsequent self&#8208;immolative cleavage, realizing selective uptake and controlled protein degradation in vitro. An in vivo study revealed that two sr&#8208;PROTACs with phosphate&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing cages exhibited high solubility and long plasma exposure, which were specifically activated by tumor overexpressing phosphatase or low dosage of X&#8208;Ray irradiation in situ, leading to efficient protein degradation and potent tumor remission. With more reactive biomarkers to be screened from clinical practice, our caging library could provide a general tool to design activatable PROTACs, prodrugs, antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and smart biomaterials for personalized treatment, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine.

         <title>Facile Borylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, Imines, Arenes and Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Boranes and a Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a stable semiconductor material, ultrathin CdS nanosheets, can act as a heterogeneous visible&#8208;light photoredox catalyst to orchestrate oxidative and reductive interfacial electron transfers for borylation of assorted alkenes, alkynes, imines and aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane. The low&#8208;cost and easily prepared CdS catalyst can be recovered and reused for several runs with conserved activity.







Abstract
Although the development of radical chain and photocatalytic borylation reactions using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;borane as boron source is remarkable, the persistent problems, including the use of hazardous and high&#8208;energy radical initiators or the recyclability and photostability issues of soluble homogeneous photocatalysts, still leave great room for further development in a sustainable manner. Herein, we report a conceptually different approach toward highly functionalized organoborane synthesis by using recoverable ultrathin cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanosheets as a heterogeneous photocatalyst, and a general and mild borylation platform that enables regioselective borylation of a wide variety of alkenes (arylethenes, trifluoromethylalkenes, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and nitriles), alkynes, imines and electron&#8208;poor aromatic rings with NHC&#8208;borane as boryl radical precursor. Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both photogenerated electrons and holes on the CdS fully perform their own roles, thereby resulting in enhancement of photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS.

         <title>Benzotriazole&#8208;Based 3D Four&#8208;Arm Small Molecules Enable 19.1&#8201;% Efficiency for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;Based Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>

We synthesized three 3D four&#8208;arm small molecules with spirobifluorene as the central core and different end&#8208;group&#8208;modified benzotriazole units as arms. By incorporating four&#8208;arm molecules, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieved improved efficiencies of 18.7&#8211;19.1&#8201;%, benefiting from triggered multiple mechanisms and the inhibited excessive aggregation of Y6. Our results open a new avenue for the design of promising guest molecules for ternary OSCs.







Abstract
A third component featuring a planar backbone structure similar to the binary host molecule has been the preferred ingredient for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we explored a new avenue that introduces 3D&#8208;structured molecules as guest acceptors. Spirobifluorene (SF) is chosen as the core to combine with three different terminal&#8208;modified (rhodanine, thiazolidinedione, and dicyano&#8208;substituted rhodanine) benzotriazole (BTA) units, affording three four&#8208;arm molecules, SF&#8208;BTA1, SF&#8208;BTA2, and SF&#8208;BTA3, respectively. After adding these three materials to the classical system PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, the resulting ternary devices obtained ultra&#8208;high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.1&#8201;%, 18.7&#8201;%, and 18.8&#8201;%, respectively, compared with the binary OSCs (PCE=17.4&#8201;%). SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 can work as energy donors to increase charge generation via energy transfer. In addition, the charge transfer between PM6 and SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 also acts to enhance charge generation. Introducing SF&#8208;BTA1&#8208;3 could form acceptor alloys to modify the molecular energy level and inhibit the self&#8208;aggregation of Y6, thereby reducing energy loss and balancing charge transport. Our success in 3D multi&#8208;arm materials as the third component shows good universality and brings a new perspective. The further functional development of multi&#8208;arm materials could make OSCs more stable and efficient.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed (dynamic) kinetic ring&#8208;opening of biaryl oxazepines with water has been disclosed. A wide range of biaryl oxazepine substrates underwent this catalytic asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in a highly enantioselective manner. Key parameters for the success of this reaction are the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions.







Abstract
The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly regioselective hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes through ligand&#8208;free iridium(0) nanoparticle catalysis is described. This novel pathway allows the formation of both new and well&#8208;established H8&#8208;BINAP ligand&#8208;types.







Abstract
Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free iridium (Ir)&#8208;hydride based Ir0 nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in situ generated NPs are catalytically active. A control nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study revealed the presence of metal&#8208;surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir0 species. A control NMR study confirmed that hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of Ir0 in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;BINAP) and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.

An efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates was reported via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion, achieving excellent anomeric/diastereo&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a RhII/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2&#8208;carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8722;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using combinations of machine&#8208;learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high&#8208;entropy materials for catalyst discovery.







Abstract
Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.

     alt="A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru Composition Space**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using combinations of machine-learning inferred input features and different prediction models, the measured catalytic activity of 1582 complex solid solution alloys within the Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru composition space was predicted. The results show multiple approaches converging on the same understanding of the underlying catalytic theory and demonstrate a viable strategy using high-entropy materials for catalyst discovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compositionally complex materials such as high-entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor-activity relationship, as experimentally screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross-validated mean absolute error of 0.042&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by applying a theory-derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high-entropy materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;derived Fluorinated Secondary Interphase for Reversible Zn&#8208;graphite Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A fluorinated cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer that facilitates reversible anion intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation processes in dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIB) by preventing graphite exfoliation and suppressing solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation is demonstrated. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB with high Coulombic efficiency and an attractive discharge capacity.







Abstract
The irreversibility of anion intercalation&#8208;deintercalation is a fundamental issue in determining the cycling stability of a dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB). In this work, we demonstrate that using a partially fluorinated carbonate solvent can drive a beneficial fluorinated secondary interphase layer formation. Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8722;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB&#8212;a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5&#8201;% after 800&#8197;cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a mid&#8208;point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7&#8197;V (at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self&#8208;discharge behavior, preserving 29&#8197;times of the capacity retention rate compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent, after standing for 24&#8197;hours. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite&#8208;based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Sb2F10 in the Chemical Synthesis of F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism for the chemical synthesis of F2 has been elucidated by experimental and electronic structure theory methods. The elimination of F2 from MnF4 requires a large excess of SbF5 occurring in the last reaction step by addition of SbF5 to the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11]&#8722; anion producing F2 and crystalline Mn[Sb2F11]2.







Abstract
The purely chemical synthesis of fluorine is a spectacular reaction which for more than a century had been believed to be impossible. In 1986, it was finally experimentally achieved, but since then this important reaction has not been further studied and its detailed mechanism had been a mystery. The known thermal stability of MnF4 casts serious doubts on the originally proposed hypothesis that MnF4 is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes spontaneously to a lower manganese fluoride and F2. This apparent discrepancy has now been resolved experimentally and by electronic structure calculations. It is shown that the reductive elimination of F2 requires a large excess of SbF5 and occurs in the last reaction step when in the intermediate [SbF6][MnF2][Sb2F11] the addition of one more SbF5 molecule to the [SbF6]&#8722; anion generates a second tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anion. The two tridentate [Sb2F11]&#8722; anions then provide six fluorine bridges to the Mn atom thereby facilitating the reductive elimination of the two fluorine ligands as F2.

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effectively managing excess lead iodide is crucial for enhancing perovskite stability. An innovative approach, tailoring functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets, stabilizes the perovskite structure and improves charge extraction. This leads to a significant boost in power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells, providing a novel perspective on stabilizing photovoltaic devices.







Abstract
Stability issues could prevent lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from commercialization despite it having a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7&#8201;% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. The devices retain 93.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.

         <title>A Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Microporous Polymer for a Wittig Reaction Cycle in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous reaction cycle for the Wittig reaction has been developed by synthesising a polymer with permanent porosity that incorporates the Wittig reagent. Therefore, the highly energy&#8208;intensive separation process needed in the homogeneous reaction pathway can be avoided. The material described could enable a continuous Wittig process in industry.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is a key step in industrial processes to synthesise large quantities of vitamin&#8197;A and various other important chemicals that are used in daily life. This article presents a pathway to achieve the Wittig reaction in a solid network. A highly porous triphenylphosphine&#8208;based polymer was applied as a solid Wittig reagent that undergoes, in a multi&#8208;step cycle, in total six post&#8208;synthetic modifications. This allowed for regeneration of the solid Wittig reagent and reuse for the same reaction cycle. Of particular industrial relevance is that the newly developed material also enables a simple way of separating the product by filtration. Therefore, additional costly and difficult separation and purification steps are no longer needed.

         <title>Breaking Local Charge Symmetry of Iron Single Atoms for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed iron atoms coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon nanocage substrates for NO3&#8722;RR was designed. The tuning of P increases the electron density of the Fe center, which promotes the adsorption and proton transfer of nitrate ions and related intermediates on the surface of electrocatalyst, leading to the superior NO3&#8722;RR performance at low overpotentials.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of nitrate pollutants into value&#8208;added ammonia is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the development of electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) has been hampered by high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency. Here we develop an iron single&#8208;atom catalyst coordinated with nitrogen and phosphorus on hollow carbon polyhedron (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C) as a NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalyst. Owing to the tuning effect of phosphorus atoms on breaking local charge symmetry of the single&#8208;Fe&#8208;atom catalyst, it facilitates the adsorption of nitrate ions and enrichment of some key reaction intermediates during the NO3&#8722;RR process. The Fe&#8722;N/P&#8722;C catalyst exhibits 90.3&#8201;% ammonia Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 17980&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the reported Fe&#8208;based catalysts. Furthermore, operando SR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy measurements reveal the reaction pathway based on key intermediates observed under different applied potentials and reaction durations. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the optimized free energy of NO3&#8722;RR intermediates is ascribed to the asymmetric atomic interface configuration, which achieves the optimal electron density distribution. This work demonstrates the critical role of atomic&#8208;level precision modulation by heteroatom doping for the NO3&#8722;RR, providing an effective strategy for improving the catalytic performance of single atom catalysts in different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Regulating the Sequence Structure of Conjugated Block Copolymers Enables Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the sequence structure of conjugated block copolymers by two&#8208;pot polymerization, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is obtained which enables single&#8208;component organic solar cells to achieve 13.4&#8201;% efficiency with enhanced stability. In addition, for the first time, large&#8208;area rigid and flexible single&#8208;component organic solar cells are reported with an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;% and 10.73&#8201;%, respectively, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.







Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) by covalently bonding a polymer donor and polymer acceptor become more and more appealing due to the formation of a favorable and stable morphology. Unfortunately, a deep understanding of the effect of the assembly behavior caused by the sequence structure of CBCs on the device performance is still missing. Herein, from the aspect of manipulating the sequence length and distribution regularity of CBCs, we synthesized a series of new CBCs, namely D18(20)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT and D18(60)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by two&#8208;pot polymerization, and D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT(r) by traditional one&#8208;pot method. It is observed that precise manipulation of sequence length and distribution regularity of the polymer blocks fine&#8208;tunes the self&#8208;assembly of the CBCs, optimizes film morphology, improves optoelectronic properties, and reduces energy loss, leading to simultaneously improved efficiency and stability. Among these CBCs, the D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device achieves a high efficiency of 13.4&#8201;% with enhanced stability, which is an outstanding performance among SCOSCs. Importantly, the regular sequence distribution and suitable sequence length of the CBCs enable a facile film&#8208;forming process of the printed device. For the first time, the blade&#8208;coated large&#8208;area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62&#8201;%/10.73&#8201;%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.

         <title>Biselenophene Imide: Enabling Polymer Acceptor with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel distannylated electron&#8208;deficient monomer with high purity and reactivity was synthesized, which enables access to acceptor&#8208;acceptor type polymer acceptor PY5&#8208;BSeI with high molecular weight, planar backbone, narrow band gap, and low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO levels. The polymer shows a high electron mobility and very promising efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
The shortage of narrow band gap polymer acceptors with high electron mobility is the major bottleneck for developing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, we synthesize a distannylated electron&#8208;deficient biselenophene imide monomer (BSeI&#8208;Tin) with high purity/reactivity, affording an excellent chance to access acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;A) type polymer acceptors. Copolymerizing BSeI&#8208;Tin with dibrominated monomer Y5&#8208;Br, the resulting A&#8211;A polymer PY5&#8208;BSeI shows a higher molecular weight, narrower band gap, deeper&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels and larger electron mobility than the donor&#8211;acceptor type counterpart PY5&#8208;BSe. Consequently, the PY5&#8208;BSeI&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.77&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current of 24.93&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 75.83&#8201;%. This efficiency is much higher than that (10.70&#8201;%) of the PY5&#8208;BSe&#8208;based devices. Our study demonstrates that BSeI is a promising building block for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors and stannylation of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks offers an excellent approach to developing A&#8211;A type polymers for all&#8208;PSCs and even beyond.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Structures of Iron Clusters through Orbital Rehybridization by Adjacent Single Copper Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Combined density functional theory calculation and experimental analysis demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent Cu&#8722;N4 single atoms could regulate the d orbitals of Fe clusters through rehybridization to improve the release of *OH intermediates, thus achieving excellent oxygen reduction reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structure&#8208;property correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M)&#8722;N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well&#8208;screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu&#8722;N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O&#8722;O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8722;N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;eV in alkali and 0.80&#8197;eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly&#8208;metallic centers for electrocatalysis.

The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.92&#8197;eV in alkali and 0.80&#8197;eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly-metallic centers for electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk Passivation Enables Hundredfold&#8208;Enhanced Electroluminescence of Monophosphine Cu4I4 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode based on a monodentate&#8208;ligand&#8208;based Cu4I4 cube realized a record luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) beyond 104&#8197;nits and 15&#8201;%, respectively, owing to a bulk passivation effect of the active host matrix through non&#8208;covalent N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu interactions. This markedly reduces nonradiative decay, leading to a doubled photoluminescence quantum yield of the film (99&#8201;%) and a 100&#8208;fold and sevenfold increased luminance and EQE of the devices, respectively.







Abstract
Electroluminescent (EL) clusters emerged rapidly, owing to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid character useful for comprehensive performance integration and the potential for large&#8208;scale display and lighting applications. However, despite their good photoluminescent (PL) properties, until present, no efficient EL monodentate ligand&#8208;based clusters were reported due to structural variation during processing and excitation and exciton confinement on cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Here we demonstrate an effective bulky passivation strategy for efficient cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes with a monophosphine Cu4I4 cube named [TMeOPP]4Cu4I4. With terminal pyridine groups, an active matrix named TmPyPB supports an effective host&#8208;cluster interplay for configuration fixation, structural stabilization, and exciton&#8208;confinement optimization. Compared to common inactive hosts, the passivation effects of TmPyPB markedly reduce trap&#8208;state densities by 24&#8211;40&#8201;% to suppress nonradiative decay, resulting in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PL and EL quantum yields reaching 99&#8201;% and 15.6&#8201;%, respectively, which are significantly improved by about 7&#8208;fold. TmPyPB simultaneously increases EL luminance to 104 nits, which is &#8776;100&#8208;fold that of the non&#8208;doped analogue.

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible coordination networks exhibit crossover sorption with change in affinity and uptake capacity on varying the temperature. The coordination networks show reverse affinity and uptake capacity for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4. This phenomenon was verified by both sorption isotherm and isobar measurements at different temperature ranges. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations were used to elucidate the mechanisms.







Abstract
Porous sorbents are materials that are used for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, in this study, we report a rare example of &#8220;crossover sorption,&#8221; in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs), [Zn2(L1)(L2)2]n (PCP&#8208;1) and [Zn2(L1)(L3)2]n (PCP&#8208;2) (L1= 1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene, L2=5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene, and L3=5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4, in which the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis to reveal the guest inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 for C2H2, CO2, C2H6, and C2H4 gases at various temperatures. Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (sc&#8208;sc) transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest binding positions, nature of host&#8211;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions, and their phase transformations upon exposure to these gases. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Lattice Compression Revealed at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice compression at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale was first achieved in a newly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 nanocluster, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction compared to the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 nanocluster without lattice variation. DFT calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
Lattice tuning at the &#8776;1&#8197;nm scale is fascinating and challenging; for instance, lattice compression at such a minuscule scale has not been observed. The lattice compression might also bring about some unusual properties, which waits to be verified. Through ligand induction, we herein achieve the lattice compression in a &#8776;1&#8197;nm gold nanocluster for the first time, as detected by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In a freshly synthesized Au52(CHT)28 (CHT=S&#8208;c&#8722;C6H11) nanocluster, the lattice distance of the (110) facet is found to be compressed from 4.51 to 3.58&#8197;&#197; at the near end. However, the lattice distances of the (111) and (100) facets show no change in different positions. The lattice&#8208;compressed nanocluster exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) compared to that exhibited by the same&#8208;sized Au52(TBBT)32 (TBBT=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzenethiolate) nanocluster and larger Au nanocrystals without lattice variation, indicating that lattice tuning is an efficient method for tailoring the properties of metal nanoclusters. Further theoretical calculations explain the high CO2RR performance of the lattice&#8208;compressed Au52(CHT)28 and provide a correlation between its structure and catalytic activity.

         <title>An Encodable Scaffold for Sequence&#8208;Specific Recognition of Duplex RNA</title>

Recognition of nucleic acids by designed ligands has been a long&#8208;term objective due to the biological potential of these ligands. The significant goal of developing small molecule and protein motifs that target duplex DNA has been met but a recognition code for duplex RNA remains in infancy. We show that naturally occurring DNA&#8208;binding helix fork motifs, which do not target equivalent duplex RNA sequences, can be engineered to recognize RNA.







Abstract
RNA, unlike DNA, folds into a multitude of secondary and tertiary structures. This structural diversity has impeded the development of ligands that can sequence&#8208;specifically target this biomolecule. We sought to develop ligands for double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments, which are ubiquitous in RNA tertiary structure. The major groove of double&#8208;stranded DNA is sequence&#8208;specifically recognized by a range of dimeric helical transcription factors, including the basic leucine zippers (bZIP) and basic helix&#8208;loop&#8208;helix (bHLH) proteins; however, such simple structural motifs are not prevalent in RNA&#8208;binding proteins. We interrogated the high&#8208;resolution structures of DNA and RNA to identify requirements for a helix fork motif to occupy dsRNA major grooves akin to dsDNA. Our analysis suggested that the rigidity and angle of approach of dimeric helices in bZIP/bHLH motifs are not ideal for the binding of dsRNA major grooves. This investigation revealed that the replacement of the leucine zipper motifs in bHLH proteins with synthetic crosslinkers would allow recognition of dsRNA. We show that a model bHLH DNA&#8208;binding motif does not bind dsRNA but can be reengineered as an RNA ligand. Based on this hypothesis, we rationally designed a miniature synthetic crosslinked helix fork (CHF) as a generalizable proteomimetic scaffold for targeting dsRNA. We evaluated several CHF constructs against a set of RNA and DNA hairpins to probe the specificity of the designed construct. Our studies reveal a new class of proteomimetics as an encodable platform for sequence&#8208;specific recognition of dsRNA.

         <title>High Valence State Sites as Favorable Reductive Centers for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high valence Co3+ sites in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid catalyst can serve as the active site to drive a highly efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction at high current densities. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for producing sustainable and clean hydrogen. Typically, high valence state sites are favorable for oxidation evolution reaction (OER), while low valence states can facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, here we proposed a high valence state of Co3+ in Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx hybrid as the favorable center for efficient and stable HER, while structural analogues with low chemical states showed much worse performance. As a result, the Ni9.5Co0.5&#8722;S&#8722;FeOx catalyst could drive alkaline HER with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 22&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 175&#8197;mV for 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the industrial temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, with an excellent stability over 300&#8197;h. Moreover, this material could work for both OER and HER, with a low cell voltage being 1.730&#8197;V to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting at 60&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) clearly identified the high valence Co3+ sites, while in situ XAS during HER and theoretical calculations revealed the favorable electron capture at Co3+ and suitable H adsorption/desorption energy around Co3+, which could accelerate the HER. The understanding of high valence states to drive reductive reactions may pave the way for the rational design of energy&#8208;related catalysts.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt Single Atoms through Pt&#8722;Se Electron Bridges on Vacancy&#8208;enriched Nickel Selenide for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. Owing to the enriched vacancies of nickel selenide supported Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst with Pt&#8722;Se electron bridges, it exhibits an outstanding HER catalytic performance, which is ascribed to the accelerated electron transfer property, optimized water&#8208;dissociation ability and reduced reaction energy barrier.







Abstract
Rational design of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts provides a promising strategy to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we presented a novel and efficient strategy for utilizing the low electron&#8208;density region of substrate to effectively trap and confine high electron&#8208;density metal atoms. The Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported by nickel selenide with rich vacancies was prepared via a hydrothermal&#8208;impregnation stepwise approach. Through experimental testation and DFT theoretical calculation, we confirm that Pt single atoms are well distributed at cationic vacancies of nickel selenide with loading amount of 3.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. Moreover, the atomic Pt combined with the high electronegative Se to form Pt&#8722;Se bond as a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between single atoms and substrate for fast electron translation. This novel catalyst shows an extremely low overpotential of 45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an excellent stability over 120&#8197;h. Furthermore, the nickel selenide supported Pt SACs exhibits long&#8208;term stability for practical application, which maintains a high current density of 390&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 80&#8197;h with a retention of 99&#8201;%. This work points a promising direction for designing single atoms catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability for advanced green energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance of porous organic polymers tunes the relative position of TFSI&#8722; anions and catalytic sites, which affects the electron transfer ability, resulting in different LiF contents in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) of Li&#8208;ion batteries. The LiF&#8208;rich SEI formed under the steric hindrance influence of a single methyl group enhances the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8722; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8722; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8722; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel SPD&#8208;NH2 organocatalyst that works cooperatively with a PdII complex to catalyze the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation. It demonstrates great reactivity, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, bridged or fused bicyclic systems can be conveniently transformed into diverse di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetracyclic scaffolds for further conversion into biologically important compounds.







Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and PdII complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8722;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the PdII complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrahigh S&#8208;content additive, methylene methyl disulfonate, is preferentially oxidized via the strong interaction with PF6&#8722; anions. This forms the sulfur&#8208;rich interphase and broadens the oxidation stability of electrolyte, thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cells.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an additive with ultrahigh S&#8208;content (34.04&#8201;%, methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6&#8197;V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8722; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, facilitating the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6&#8197;V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99&#8201;% even after 800&#8197;cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>An In Situ Investigation of the Protein Corona Formation Kinetics of Single Nanomedicine Carriers by Self&#8208;Regulated Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy is designed to investigate protein corona formation kinetics of single nanomedicine carriers in situ. The nanoparticles with negative charges spontaneously enhance their local ECL intensity, and the enhancement degree is influenced by the formed protein corona. With the high spatiotemporal resolution of ECL microscopy, the protein corona formation process is monitored in situ and information of protein corona formation kinetics is obtained.







Abstract
Protein coronas are present extensively at the bio&#8208;nano interface due to the natural adsorption of proteins onto nanomaterials in biological fluids. Aside from the robust property of nanoparticles, the dynamics of the protein corona shell largely define their chemical identity by altering interface properties. However, the soft coronas are normally complex and rapidly changing. To real&#8208;time monitor the entire formation, we report here a self&#8208;regulated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the interaction of the Ru(bpy)33+ with the nanoparticle surface. Thus, the heterogeneity of the protein corona is in situ observed in single nanoparticle &#8220;cores&#8221; before and after loading drugs in nanomedicine carriers. The label&#8208;free, optical stable and dynamic ECL microscopy minimize misinterpretations caused by the variation of nanoparticle size and polydispersity. Accordingly, the synergetic actions of proteins and nanoparticles properties are uncovered by chemically engineered protein corona. After comparing the protein corona formation kinetics in different complex systems and different nanomedicine carriers, the universality and accuracy of this technique were well demonstrated via the protein corona formation kinetics curves regulated by competitive adsorption of Ru(bpy)33+ and multiple proteins on surface of various carriers. The work is of great significance for studying bio&#8208;nano interface in drug delivery and targeted cancer treatment.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly and Chiral Induction of Metallo&#8208;Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different hierarchical superstructures were achieved with the addition of different halide ions (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;), which altered the intermolecular interactions between metallo&#8208;cage T and PF6&#8722;. In addition, chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.







Abstract
The precise control over hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures relying on the elaboration of multiple noncovalent interactions between basic building blocks is both elusive and highly desirable. We herein report a terpyridine&#8208;based metallo&#8208;cage T with a tetrahedral motif and utilized it as an efficient building block for the controlled hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of superstructures in response to different halide ions. Initially, the hierarchical superstructure of metallo&#8208;cage T adopted a hexagonal close&#8208;packed structure. By adding Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722; or I&#8722;, drastically different hierarchical superstructures with highly&#8208;tight hexagonal packing or graphite&#8208;like packing arrangements, respectively, have been achieved. These unusual halide&#8208;ion&#8208;triggered hierarchical structural changes resulted in quite distinct intermolecular channels, which provided new insights into the mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular aggregation and crystal growth based on macromolecular construction. In addition, the chiral induction of the metallo&#8208;cage T can be realized with the addition of chiral anions, which stereoselectively generated either PPPP&#8208; or MMMM&#8208;type enantiomers.

         <title>Rapid Ozone Decomposition over Water&#8208;activated Monolithic MoO3/Graphdiyne Nanowalls under High Humidity</title>

The sp C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo hybridization in MoO3/GDY facilitates the activation of adsorbed water molecules to hydroxyl species, which act as the new active sites for rapid and efficient ozone decomposition under high humidity for potential practical application.







Abstract
Catalytic ozone (O3) decomposition at high relative humidity (RH) remains a great challenge due to the catalysts poison and deactivation under high humidity. Here, we firstly elaborate the role of water activation and the corresponding mechanism of the promoted O3 decomposition over the three&#8208;dimensional monolithic molybdenum oxide/graphdiyne (MoO3/GDY) catalyst. The O3 decomposition over MoO3/GDY reaches up to 100&#8201;% under high humid condition (75&#8201;% RH) at room temperature, which is 4.0 times as high as that of dry conditions, significantly surpasses other carbon&#8208;based MoO3 materials(&#8804;7.1&#8201;%). The sp&#8208;hybridized carbon in GDY donates electrons to MoO3 along the C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond, facilitating water activation to form hydroxyl species. As a result, hydroxyl species dissociated from water act as new active sites, promoting the adsorption of O3 and the generation of new intermediate species (hydroxyl &#8901;OH and superoxo &#8901;O2&#8722;), which significantly lowers the energy barriers of O3 decomposition (0.57&#8197;eV lower than dry conditions).

         <title>Modular Functionalization of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Nitrogen Recovery from Fresh Urine
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular functionalized MOF&#8208;808 derivatives were deliberately designed and integrated in a newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process targeting fresh urine. Three distinct modification methods were applied for the development of functional MOFs which deliver efficient nitrogen conversion, recovery, detection, and all contributing to high fresh urine nitrogen recovery that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment.







Abstract
Nitrogen recovery from wastewater represents a sustainable route to recycle reactive nitrogen (Nr). It can reduce the demand of producing Nr from the energy&#8208;extensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process and lower the risk of causing eutrophication simultaneously. In this aspect, source&#8208;separated fresh urine is an ideal source for nitrogen recovery given its ubiquity and high nitrogen contents. However, current techniques for nitrogen recovery from fresh urine require high energy input and are of low efficiencies because the recovery target, urea, is a challenge to separate. In this work, we developed a novel fresh urine nitrogen recovery treatment process based on modular functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, we employed three distinct modification methods to MOF&#8208;808 and developed robust functional materials for urea hydrolysis, ammonium adsorption, and ammonia monitoring. By integrating these functional materials into our newly developed nitrogen recovery treatment process, we achieved an average of 75&#8201;% total nitrogen reduction and 45&#8201;% nitrogen recovery with a 30&#8208;minute treatment of synthetic fresh urine. The nitrogen recovery process developed in this work can serve as a sustainable and efficient nutrient management that is suitable for decentralized wastewater treatment. This work also provides a new perspective of implementing versatile advanced materials for water and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed Site&#8208;Selective Csp3&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic amines can undergo Csp3&#8722;H borylation using BBr3. At high temperature in a microwave reactor, the &#945;&#8208;borylation is preferred, whereas the presence of a Lewis base at lower temperature will lead to the &#946;&#8208;borylation selectively. Mechanistic studies support the presence of an enamine intermediate for both processes.







Abstract
The borylation of Csp3&#8722;H bonds is a challenging transformation that is typically restricted to transition metal catalysis. Herein, we report the site&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free Csp3&#8722;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines. It is possible to selectively borylate piperidine derivatives at the &#945; or &#946; positions according to the reaction conditions. The mechanism was supported by NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations. It suggests that the piperidine is dehydrogenated by complexation with BBr3 to produce an enamine intermediate, which is in turn borylated at either the &#945; or &#946; position according to the reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>
The first nonlinear optically active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), which feature unique quadruple bidentate&#8208;ligand [Hg(NO3)4] modules, exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation responses, together with sufficient birefringences and short ultraviolet cutoff edges.







Abstract
The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A=(KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for UV NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8208;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of elevated de&#8208;solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co&#8208;solvent to reduce H2O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&#8722; into the electrolyte. An I&#8722; ion&#8208;rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS2@SS full cell cycles for 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8722; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 1600&#8197;cycles.

&lt;p&gt;The problem of elevated de-solvation barrier caused by the addition of organic co-solvent to reduce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activity is solved via adding a trace amount of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into the electrolyte. An I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion-rich adsorbing layer is formed on the surface of Zn anode which promotes Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation and induces uniform Zn plating. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell achieves 10500&#8197;h lifetime and Zn//VS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@SS full cell cycles for 170&#8197;cycles with a high Zn utilization of 27&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-induced Zn-corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50&#8197;mM iodine ions into an organic-water (1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)+water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O hydrogen-bond network and exclude H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation shell. And the I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation barrier from 74.33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 32.26&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5&#8197;months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5&#8201;%). In particular, the Zn//VS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170&#8197;cycles at a low N&#8201;:&#8201;P ratio (3.64).

         <title>Polymer Chainmail: Steric Hindrance and Charge Compensation of Anion&#8208;Doped PEDOT to Boost Stress Deformation of Compressible Supercapacitor</title>

         <dc:description>
After the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films known as &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; were modified by PF&#8722;6 anion doping, the ion adsorption and diffusion processes on the PEDOT chains were significantly optimized due to the steric hindrance and charge compensation effects, so the cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% after 20,000 cycles) and rate performance (retaining 81.1&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3) were improved.







Abstract
Conducting polymers with high theoretical capacitance and deformability are among the optimal candidates for compressible supercapacitor electrode materials. However, achieving both mechanical and electrochemical stabilities in a single electrode remains a great challenge. To address this issue, the &#8220;Polymer Chainmail&#8221; is proposed with reversible deformation capability and enhances stability because of the steric hindrance and charge compensation effect of doped anions. As a proof of concept, four common anions are selected as dopants for Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and their effects on the adsorption and diffusion of H+ on PEDOT are verified using density functional theory calculations. Owing to the film formation effect, the 
 doped PEDOT/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon foam exhibits good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the composite demonstrates excellent rate performance and stability due to suitable anion doping. This finding provides new insights into the preparation of electrochemically stable conductive polymer&#8208;based compressible electrode materials.

         <title>Dual Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites Regulate Silver&#8208;Copper Bimetallic Oxide Nanowires for Highly Selective Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>

Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the surface of Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires are conducive to formation of a Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu adsorption configuration, which facilitates further protonation of a CO* intermediate. The active site promotes CO2 photoreduction to CH4 with improved selectivity to hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Highly selective photoreduction of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons is of great importance to achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Precisely manipulating the formation of the Metal1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal2 (M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2) intermediate on the photocatalyst interface is the most critical step for regulating selectivity, while still a significant challenge. Herein, inspired by the polar electronic structure feature of CO2 molecule, we propose a strategy whereby the Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites confined in a bimetallic catalyst surface are conducive to forming a M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate precisely, which can promote selectivity to hydrocarbon formation. Employing the Ag2Cu2O3 nanowires with abundant Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites on the preferred exposed {110} surface as a model catalyst, 100&#8201;% selectivity toward photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 has been achieved. Subsequent surface&#8208;quenching experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag Lewis acid&#8208;base dual sites do play a vital role in regulating the M1&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M2 intermediate formation that is considered to be prone to convert CO2 into hydrocarbons. This study reports a highly selective CO2 photocatalyst, which was designed on the basis of a newly proposed theory for precise regulation of reaction intermediates. Our findings will stimulate further research on dual&#8208;site catalyst design for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons.

A DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag1812+ cluster displays dual emission which can be used to create a ratiometric light intensity meter.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are easily tunable emitters with intriguing photophysical properties. Here, a DNA&#8208;AgNC with dual emission in the red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions is presented. Mass spectrometry data showed that two DNA strands stabilize 18 silver atoms with a nanocluster charge of 12+. Besides determining the composition and charge of DNA2[Ag18]12+, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved methods were applied to characterize the picosecond red fluorescence and the relatively intense microsecond&#8208;lived NIR luminescence. During this process, the luminescence&#8208;to&#8208;fluorescence ratio was found to be excitation&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent. This peculiar feature is very rare for molecular emitters and allows the use of DNA2[Ag18]12+ as a nanoscale excitation intensity probe. For this purpose, calibration curves were constructed using three different approaches based either on steady&#8208;state or time&#8208;resolved emission measurements. The results showed that processes like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) or photon upconversion through triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) could be excluded for DNA2[Ag18]12+. We, therefore, speculate that the ratiometric excitation intensity response could be the result of optically activated delayed fluorescence.

         <title>Fast Water Transport in UTSA&#8208;280 via a Knock&#8208;Off Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique water transport mechanism is investigated in the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UTSA&#8208;280. An incoming water molecule can replace a coordinated molecule, referred to as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. UTSA&#8208;280 has 1D channels but the knock&#8208;off transport enables water diffusion along the other two dimensions, mimicking a pseudo&#8208;3D mass transfer. As a result, the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane has a high diffusion selectivity of water over ethanol.







Abstract
Water and other small molecules frequently coordinate within metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). These coordinated molecules may actively engage in mass transfer, moving together with the transport molecules, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined. In this study, we explore a unique water transfer mechanism in UTSA&#8208;280, where an incoming water molecule can displace a coordinated molecule for mass transfer. We refer to this process as the &#8220;knock&#8208;off&#8221; mechanism. Despite UTSA&#8208;280 possessing one&#8208;dimensional channels, the knock&#8208;off transport enables water movement along the other two axes, effectively simulating a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional mass transfer. Even with a relatively narrow pore width, the knock&#8208;off mechanism enables a high water flux in the UTSA&#8208;280 membrane. The knock&#8208;off mechanism also renders UTSA&#8208;280 superior water/ethanol diffusion selectivity for pervaporation. To validate this unique mechanism, we conducted 1H and 2H solid&#8208;state NMR on UTSA&#8208;280 after the adsorption of deuterated water. We also derived potential energy diagrams from the density functional theory to gain atomic&#8208;level insight into the knock&#8208;off and the direct&#8208;hopping mechanisms. The simulation findings reveal that the energy barrier of the knock&#8208;off mechanism is marginally lower than the direct&#8208;hopping pathway, implying its potential role in enhancing water diffusion in UTSA&#8208;280.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;loss Optical Waveguides through Balancing Deep&#8208;Blue TADF and Orange Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Hybrid Antimony Halide Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new group of hybrid antimony halide microstructures are fabricated through a rapid liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, which exhibit ultralow&#8208;loss 1D and 2D optical waveguides through balancing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and orange room temperature phosphorescence (RTP).







Abstract
Harnessing the potential of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is crucial for developing light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, sensors, and many others. However, effective strategies in this domain are still relatively scarce. This study presents a new approach to achieving highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF (with a PLQY of 25&#8201;%) and low&#8208;energy orange RTP (with a PLQY of 90&#8201;%) through the fabrication of lead&#8208;free hybrid halides. This new class of monomeric and dimeric 0D antimony halides can be facilely synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up solution process, requiring only a few seconds to minutes, which offer exceptional stability and nontoxicity. By leveraging the highly adaptable molecular arrangement and crystal packing modes, the hybrid antimony halides demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into regular 1D microrod and 2D microplate morphologies. This self&#8208;assembly is facilitated by multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the inorganic cores and organic shells. Notably, these microstructures exhibit outstanding polarized luminescence and function as low&#8208;dimensional optical waveguides with remarkably low optical&#8208;loss coefficients. Therefore, this work not only presents a pioneering demonstration of deep&#8208;blue TADF in hybrid antimony halides, but also introduces 1D and 2D micro/nanostructures that hold promising potential for applications in white LEDs and low&#8208;dimensional photonic systems.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Compatible Core&#8208;Shell Nanoreactor for in Situ H2&#8208;Driven NAD(P)H Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell nanoreactor was constructed for the manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis. The nanoreactor enabled not only the efficient H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration via the activated hydrogen species relay between metal nanoparticle and metal complex but also the compatibility of the metal catalysts and enzyme for chemoenzymatic cascade reduction.







Abstract
The regeneration of the reduced form cofactor NAD(P)H is essential for the extra&#8208;cellular application of bio&#8208;reduction, which necessitates not only the development of efficient artificial NAD(P)H regeneration catalytic system but also its well compatibility with the cascade enzymatic reduction system. In this work, we reported the preparation of a metal nanoparticle (NP) and metal complex integrated core&#8208;shell nanoreactor for H2&#8208;driven NAD(P)H regeneration through the immobilization of a Rh complex on Ni/TiO2 surface via a bipyridine contained 3D porous organic polymer (POP). In comparison with the corresponding single component metal NPs and the immobilized Rh complex, the integrated catalyst presented simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity in NAD(P)H regeneration thanks to the rapid spillover of activated H species from metal NPs to Rh complex. In addition, the size&#8208;sieving effect of POP precluded the direct interaction of enzyme and Rh complex confined in the pores, enabling the success coupling of core&#8208;shell nanoreactor and aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) for chemoenzymatic reduction of acetophenone to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol. This work provides a strategy for the rational manipulation of multicomponent cooperation catalysis.

         <title>Hybrid Sub&#8208;1&#8201;nm Nanosheets of Co&#8208;assembled MnZnCuOx and Polyoxometalate Clusters as Anodes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets anode co&#8208;assembled by MnZnCuOx (MZC) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was successfully constructed via introducing PMA clusters into MZC and precisely controlling the amount of PMA. The non&#8208;covalent interactions endowed the nanosheets with excellent structural stability, while the electron&#8208;rich properties of PMA greatly increased Li+ adsorption energy, thus exhibiting outstanding lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) usually suffer from serious volume expansion leading to the pulverization of structures, further giving rise to lower specific capacity and worse cycling stability. Herein, by introducing polyoxometalate (POM) clusters into TMOs and precisely controlling the amount of POMs, the MnZnCuOx&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid hybrid sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanosheets (MZC&#8208;PMA HSNSs) anode is successfully fabricated, where the special electron rich structure of POMs is conducive to accelerating the migration of lithium ions on the anode to obtain higher specific capacity, and the non&#8208;covalent interactions between POMs and TMOs make the HSNSs possess excellent structural and chemical stability, thus exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance in LIBs, achieving a high reversible capacity (1157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an admirable long&#8208;term cycling stability at low and high current densities.

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis at High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Correlates with its Composition&#8208;Dependent Potential of Zero Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) experiments on a thin&#8208;film Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag high&#8208;entropy alloy materials&#8208;library (HEA&#8208;ML) reveal that the potential of zero charge (PZC) of different compositions of the Pt&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ir&#8722;Ag HEA has a linear correlation with its composition&#8208;weighted average of the work function, and positively correlates with its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in acidic media.







Abstract

The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.

         <title>Low&#8208;cost and Non&#8208;flammable Eutectic Electrolytes for Advanced Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and non&#8208;flammable eutectic electrolytes are reported, which not only cost less than 1/200 of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes, but also show evident universality in various polyhydric alcohol solvents. Moreover, these eutectic electrolytes greatly expand the range of eutectic electrolytes available for advanced battery design.







Abstract
As a burgeoning electrolyte system, eutectic electrolytes based on ZnCl2/Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2 have been widely proposed in advanced Zn&#8208;I2 batteries; however, safety and cost concerns significantly limit their applications. Here, we report new&#8208;type ZnSO4&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes that are both safe and cost&#8208;effective. Their universality is evident in various solvents of polyhydric alcohols, in which multiple &#8722;OH groups not only involve in Zn2+ solvation but also interact with water, resulting in the high stability of electrolytes. Taking propylene glycol&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte as an example, it features significant advantages in non&#8208;flammability and low price that is &lt;1/200 cost of Zn(CF3SO3)2/Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;based eutectic electrolytes. Moreover, its effectiveness in confining the shuttle effects of I2 cathode and side reactions of Zn anodes is evidenced, resulting in Zn&#8208;I2 cells with high reversibility at 1&#8197;C and 91.4&#8201;% capacity remaining under 20&#8197;C. After scaling up to the pouch cell with a record mass loading of 33.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, super&#8208;high&#8208;capacity retention of 96.7&#8201;% is achieved after 500&#8197;cycles, which exceeds other aqueous counterparts. This work significantly broadens the eutectic electrolyte family for advanced Zn battery design.

         <title>Biomimetic Approach to Diverse Coral Diterpenes from a Biosynthetic Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic biology enables the semisynthesis of numerous complex chemotypes starting from the soft coral metabolite klysimplexin R produced at gram scale. This approach has the potential to provide diverse molecules for drug discovery and development using a green approach inspired by nature.







Abstract
Thousands of coral terpenes originate from simple scaffolds that undergo oxidative tailoring. While corals are excellent sources of drug leads, the challenge of supplying structurally complex drug leads from marine organisms has sometimes slowed their development. Making this even more challenging, in comparison to other organisms, such as plants and microbes, for which the terpene literature is substantial, very little is known about how the unique coral terpenes are biosynthesized and elaborated in nature. In this study, we used a semisynthetic strategy to produce at gram scale in yeast the eunicellane scaffold that underlies &gt;200 coral compounds. Synthetic oxidation reactions were explored, generating key scaffolds that reflect three of the four structural classes derived from eunicellane and enabling the first asymmetric syntheses of the natural products solenopodin C and klysimplexin Q. Biomimetic methods and detailed mechanistic studies of synthetic reactions shed light on potential enzymological reactivity, including the role of epoxide rearrangement in eunicellane biosynthesis.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Highly Selective Separation of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel two&#8208;dimensional ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), denoted as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88, is synthesized utilizing the organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine. Once activated, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 demonstrates a notable selectivity for CO2 over C2H2 with an IAST selectivity index of 1894.







Abstract
The separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important but challenging task due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. In terms of porous adsorbents for this separation, the CO2&#8208;selective porous materials are superior to the C2H2&#8208;selective ones because of the cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiency but have been rarely achieved. Herein we report our unexpected discovery of the first hydrogen bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from a simple organic linker 2,4,6&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (PYTPZ) (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88) as the highly CO2&#8208;selective porous material. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 is a two&#8208;dimensional HOFs with a pore pocket of about 7.6&#8197;&#197;. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;88 takes up a high amount of CO2 (59.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions with the record IAST selectivity of 1894. Its high performance for the CO2/C2H2 separation has been further confirmed through breakthrough experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and molecular simulations.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry makes the next move in advancing organometallic synthesis. In their Research Article (e202305775), Riina Aav, Dzmitry G. Kananovich et&#8197;al. report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes the limitations of the classic solvent&#8208;based approach. Mechanochemical activation enables the rapid generation of Grignard reagents in situ, making the process resistant to air and allowing solid Br&#248;nsted acids to be used as additives to improve yields.

Post&#8208;synthetic modifications of helical &#946;&#8208;peptide are achieved by a novel thioether&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amino acid, trans&#8208;(3S,4R)&#8208;4&#8208;aminotetrahydrothiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (ATTC). Foldamers containing ATTC maintain their 12&#8208;helical conformation while offering versatile chemical transformations such as desulfurization, tagging, oxidation, and dimerization. These capabilities are detailed in the Research Article (e202305196) by Yunho Lee, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee et&#8197;al.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous and recyclable ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles of iridium(0) enabled highly selective hydrogenation of distal unsubstituted aromatic rings to generate novel phosphine ligands. The iridium&#8208;hydride species and hydrogen bonding between the substrate and solvent facilitate the catalysis, as reported by Fabrice Gallou, Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307139).

         <title>Synthesis Strategies towards Tagged Homogeneous Catalysts To Improve Their Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review offers an overview and evaluation of the existing tagging strategies that are used to provide catalysts with improved recycling capabilities. It is focused on approaches that modify the solubility or the molecular weight to retain homogeneous catalysts in a liquid phase, which can be directly recycled. The insight provided should aid the development of more standardized catalyst recycling strategies and tags.







Abstract
The recycling of homogeneous catalysts while keeping them in the homogeneous matrix is an ongoing challenge many reactions face if they are to find industrial applications. While a plethora of different synthetic approaches towards better, recyclable homogeneous catalysts exist, the literature shows a gap when one searches for a concise overview of the different catalyst modifications. This Review is designed to close that gap by summarising the existing synthesis pathways towards polar, non&#8208;polar, fluorous, and molecular&#8208;weight&#8208;enlarged catalysts and by examining their respective synthesis routes with a focus on modular and late&#8208;stage approaches. Furthermore, we map out the potential for a generally applicable tag library that allows straightforward catalyst modifications to tune them for each desired recycling strategy.

This review offers an overview of the development of spontaneously blinking rhodamines from 2014 to 2023, as well as an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanistic aspects of spontaneous blinking.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has found extensive applications in various fields of biology and chemistry. As a vital component of SMLM, fluorophores play an essential role in obtaining super&#8208;resolution fluorescence images. Recent research on spontaneously blinking fluorophores has greatly simplified the experimental setups and extended the imaging duration of SMLM. To support this crucial development, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the development of spontaneously blinking rhodamines from 2014 to 2023, as well as the key mechanistic aspects of intramolecular spirocyclization reactions. We hope that by offering insightful design guidelines, this review will contribute to accelerating the advancement of super&#8208;resolution imaging technologies.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release surmounts numerous limitations inherent in traditional light&#8208;controlled drug release and radiochemotherapy. However, further enhancements are required in areas such as drug carrier design, advancements in radiation chemistry, and X&#8208;ray dosage control. Therefore, this article aims to explore X&#8208;rays as a stimulus for controlled drug release in DDSs development, the mechanisms of X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced drug release, and its future prospects.







Abstract
Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.

Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer character and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and the related OLEDs are also discussed.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy is devised to enhance the neutral water oxidation. The concerted promotion of electron transfer via the IrOx/NiOOH interface and proton transfer via the near&#8208;surface ion environment synergistically accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer events. The expedited kinetics enabled the direct detection of oxygen intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment that originated from hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Due to the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8722;O and Ir&#8722;OO&#8722; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8722;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.

A general approach to 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitriles was developed. The mechanism, scope, and scalability of this transformation were studied. The core was incorporated into the structure of the antihistamine drug Rupatidine instead of the pyridine ring, which led to a dramatic improvement in physicochemical properties.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework birefringent crystal exhibits strikingly large birefringence of exp. 0.60@550&#8197;nm. This attribute would enable it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.

         <title>Centimeter&#8208;Size Single Crystals of Halide Perovskite Photoferroelectric Solid Solution with Ultrahigh Pyroelectricity Boosted Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution demonstrates optoelectrical properties and a Curie temperature tunable over a wide range. When the component ratio is x=0.7, the bulk solid solution single crystal demonstrates an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric coefficient, which facilitates self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetection with boosted responsivity and detectivity over 1300&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoferroelectrics, especially emerging halide perovskite ferroelectrics, have motivated tremendous interests owing to their fascinating bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and cross&#8208;coupled functionalities. However, solid solutions of halide perovskite photoferroelectrics with controllable structure and enhanced performance are scarcely explored. Herein, through mixing cage cation, a homogeneous halide perovskite photoferroelectric PA2FAxMA1&#8722;xPb2Br7 solid solution (PA, FA and MA are CH3CH2CH2NH3+, NH2CHNH2+ and CH3NH3+, 0&#8804;x&#8804;1) has been developed, which demonstrates tunable Curie temperature in a wide range of 263&#8211;323&#8197;K and excellent optoelectrical features. As the component adjusted to x=0.7, the bulk crystal demonstrates ultrahigh pyroelectric coefficient up to 1.48&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1 around room temperature. Strikingly, benefiting from the light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity and remarkable BPVE, a self&#8208;powered and sensitive photodetector based solid solution crystals with boosted responsivity and detectivity over than 1300&#8201;% has been achieved. This pioneering work sheds light on the exploration of photoferroelectric solid solutions towards high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. A new protocol, starting from aryldiazonium salts, that uses ball milling and piezoelectric materials as redox catalysts is described. This process addresses the limitations of the Balz&#8211;Schiemann procedure, which is currently used in industry. In addition, the mechanism of this fluorination reaction is also investigated.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8211;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine and a terminal reductant.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8211;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine and a terminal reductant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) is a path toward improved hole mobility and enhanced device properties when used in solar cells. Here, we design a porphyrin supramolecule to modulate the surface properties of the commonly used Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTM in perovskite solar cells. Upon doping monoamine FeIII porphyrin into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the porphyrins self&#8208;assemble into oxygen&#8208;bridged dimer&#8208;based supramolecules located at the grain boundaries of the HTM. The doped perovskite devices exhibit an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability.







Abstract
Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine FeIII porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Initiated by Unstabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles is described. Synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products were smoothly transformed into highly substituted pyridines. The method tolerates a range of electrophiles and proceeds under an atmospheric pressure of CO.







Abstract
This report describes the first example of palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes initiated by enolate nucleophiles. The approach involves initiation by an unstabilized enolate nucleophile under an atmospheric pressure of CO and termination with a carbon electrophile. This process is compatible with a diverse range of electrophiles, including aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl iodides to yield synthetically useful 1,5&#8208;diketone products, which were demonstrated to be precursors for multi&#8208;substituted pyridines. A PdI&#8208;dimer complex with two bridging CO units was observed although its role in catalysis is not yet understood.

         <title>Self&#8208;quenched Fluorophore Dimers for DNA&#8208;PAINT and STED Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for fluorophore&#8208;labelled DNA oligonucleotides is introduced that relies on short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching of two identical fluorophores. This strategy achieves a reduction in background fluorescence, while at the same time increasing the photon budget two&#8208;fold. These probes can be applied to super&#8208;resolution techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM).







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution techniques like single&#8208;molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy have been extended by the use of non&#8208;covalent, weak affinity&#8208;based transient labelling systems. DNA&#8208;based hybrid systems are a prominent example among these transient labelling systems, offering excellent opportunities for multi&#8208;target fluorescence imaging. However, these techniques suffer from higher background relative to covalently bound fluorophores, originating from unbound fluorophore&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides. Here, we introduce short&#8208;distance self&#8208;quenching in fluorophore dimers as an efficient mechanism to reduce background fluorescence signal, while at the same time increasing the photon budget in the bound state by almost 2&#8208;fold. We characterise the optical and thermodynamic properties of fluorophore&#8208;dimer single&#8208;stranded DNA, and show super&#8208;resolution imaging applications with STED and SMLM with increased spatial resolution and reduced background.

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit with recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules was designed to establish an artificial intercellular interaction mode between T cells and cancer cells. Based on cancer recognition&#8208;induced receptor aggregation, T cells could be directly stimulated to kill target cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Amides by a Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Wolff Rearrangement
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral amides was achieved by an asymmetric Wolff rearrangement. A bifunctional phosphoric acid catalyst not only expedited the transformation but also controlled the enantioselectivity. The developed method enables the asymmetric addition between potent nucleophilic reagents and ketene species and provides a new approach to chiral amides.







Abstract
The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton&#8208;transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The enantioselective addition of potent nucleophiles to ketenes poses challenges due to competing background reactions and poor stereocontrol. Herein, we present a method for enantioselective phosphoric acid catalyzed amination of ketenes generated from &#945;-aryl-&#945;-diazoketones. Upon exposure to visible light, the diazoketones undergo Wolff rearrangement to generate ketenes. The phosphoric acid not only accelerates ketene capture by amines to form a single configuration of aminoenol intermediates but also promotes an enantioselective proton-transfer reaction of the intermediates to yield the products. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway and explained how the catalyst expedited the transformation and controlled the enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>When the Ferrocene Analogy Breaks Down: Metallocene Transmetallation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transmetallation of a transition metal metallocene &#8220;like&#8221; compound is reported for the first time. While the parent ferrocene analogue Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) is inert to this reactivity its imidazolium and NHC functionalized derivatives undergo rapid transmetallation to Ir and Cu.







Abstract
Ferrocene 1 and its dianionic Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) analogue 2 are classical compounds that display unusual stability. These compounds are not known to undergo transmetallation chemistry of the Fe&#8208;center and have been used extensively as chemical building blocks with consistent integrity. In this manuscript we describe the preparation of a charge compensated Fe(bis)(dicarbollide) species 3&#8201;Fe and its unprecedented transmetallation chemistry to Ir. Such reactions are hitherto unknown for any transition metal metallocene or metallacarborane complex. Additionally, we show that 3&#8201;Fe can be deprotonated to afford the corresponding bis(NHC) Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 that also displays unique reactivity. When 5 is reacted with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 it also undergoes a rapid transmetallation of the ferrocene &#8220;like&#8221; core to afford 6 but with the added twist that the Li&#8208;carbenoid moiety stays intact and does not transmetalate. However, when 6 is subsequently treated with CuCl, the Li&#8208;carbenoid transmetalates to Cu, which allows the controlled formation of the corresponding heterobimetallic Ir/Cu aggregate. Lastly, when Li&#8208;carbenoid 5 is treated directly with CuCl, a double transmetallation occurs from both Fe to Cu and Li&#8208;carbenoid to Cu, resulting in the trimetallic Cu cluster 8. These novel reactions pave the way for new synthetic methods to build complicated polymetallic clusters in a controlled fashion.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Fluorophores from a &#8220;Flex&#8208;activated&#8221; Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first flex&#8208;activated fluorogenic mechanophore (FA) is presented. Its retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction, resulting in the release of anthracenes with turn&#8208;on fluorescence, is achieved through compression of FA&#8208;crosslinked networks or hydrostatic high pressure applied to FA crystals and its polymers. The structural and functional diversity of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores as sensitive and unconventional optical force probes is enriched.







Abstract
Optical force probes that can release force&#8208;dependent and visualized signals with minimal changes in the polymer main chains under mechanical load are highly sought after but currently limited. In this study, we introduce a flex&#8208;activated mechanophore (FA) based on the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct of anthracene and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylatea that exhibits turn&#8208;on mechanofluorescence. We demonstrate that when FA is incorporated into polymer networks or in its crystalline state, it can release fluorescent anthracenes through a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder mechanochemical reaction under compression or hydrostatic high pressure, respectively. The flex&#8208;activated mechanism of FA is successfully confirmed. Furthermore, we systematically modulate the force delivered to the mechanophore by varying the crosslinking density of the networks and the applied macroscopic pressures. This modulation leads to incremental increases in mechanophore activation, successive release of anthracenes, and quantitative enhancement of fluorescence intensity. The exceptional potential of FA as a sensitive force probe in different bulk states is highlighted, benefiting from its unique flex&#8208;activated mode with highly emissive fluorophore releasing. Overall, this report enriches our understanding of the structures and functions of flex&#8208;activated mechanophores and polymeric materials.

         <title>Insight into the Key Restriction of BiVO4 Photoanodes Prepared by Pyrolysis Method for Scalable Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition was first unraveled to mainly result from the phase impurity caused by the relatively easy vanadium volatilization. Consequently, a BiVO4 photoanode free of tetragonal phase and decorated with NiFeOx cocatalyst was fabricated to exhibit a benchmark photocurrent density.







Abstract
Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode has been popularly investigated for promising solar water oxidation, but its intrinsic performance has been greatly retarded by the direct pyrolysis method. Here we insight the key restriction of BiVO4 prepared by metal&#8211;organic decomposition (MOD) method. It is found that the evaporation of vanadium during the pyrolysis tends to cause a substantial phase impurity, and the unexpected few tetragonal phase inhibits the charge separation evidently. Consequently, suitably excessive vanadium precursor was adopted to eliminate the phase impurity, based on which the obtained intrinsic BiVO4 photoanode could exhibit photocurrent density of 4.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE under AM 1.5 G irradiation, as comparable to the one fabricated by the currently popular two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Furthermore, the excellent performance can be maintained on the enlarged photoanode (25&#8197;cm2), demonstrating the advantage of MOD method in scalable preparation. Our work provides new insight and highlights the glorious future of MOD method for the design of scale&#8208;up efficient BiVO4 photoanode.

         <title>Atroposelective PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis for the Isoquinoline&#8208;Forming Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The atroposelective formation of isoquinoline heterocycles by a PIII/PV=O redox organocatalyzed Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction is described. With N2 release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, the method permits the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomeric isoquinolines under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. and 93&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the feasibility of atroposelective PIII/PV=O redox organocatalysis by the Staudinger&#8211;aza&#8208;Wittig reaction. The formation of isoquinoline heterocycles thereby enables the synthesis of a broad range of valuable atropisomers under mild conditions with enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;e.r. Readily prepared azido cinnamate substrates convert in high yield with stereocontrol by a chiral phosphine catalyst, which is regenerated using a silane reductant under Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis. The reaction provides access to diversified aryl isoquinolines, as well as benzoisoquinoline and naphthyridine atropisomers. The products are expeditiously transformed into N&#8208;oxides, naphthol and triaryl phosphine variants of prevalent catalysts and ligands. With dinitrogen release and aromatization as ideal driving forces, it is anticipated that atroposelective redox organocatalysis provides access to a multitude of aromatic heterocycles with precise control over their configuration.

         <title>Capture of Singlet Oxygen Modulates Host&#8208;Guest Behavior of Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 39, September 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of anthracene&#8208;based tetrahedral capsules have been shown to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. The cage cycloadducts were found to bind an array of guest molecules more weakly than their precursor cages, offering a novel method for stimuli&#8208;driven guest uptake and release.







Abstract
The anthracene panels of two tetrahedral MII4L6 cages, where MII=CoII or FeII, were found to react with photogenerated singlet oxygen (1O2) in a hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. ESI&#8208;MS analysis showed the cobalt(II) cages to undergo complete transformation of all anthracene panels into endoperoxides, whereas the iron(II) congeners underwent incomplete conversion. The reaction was found to be partially reversible in the case of the 1&#8208;FeII cage. The dioxygen&#8208;cage cycloadducts were found to bind a set of guest molecules more weakly than the parent cages, with affinity dropping by more than two orders of magnitude in some cases. The light&#8208;driven cycloaddition reaction between cage and 1O2 thus served as a stimulus for guest release and reuptake.

         <title>Engineering nucleotidoproteins for base pairing&#8208;assisted cytosolic delivery and genome editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein therapeutics targeting intracellular machineries holds profound potentials for disease treatment, and hence robust cytosolic protein delivery technologies are imperatively demanded. Inspired by the super&#8208;negatively charged, nucleotide&#8208;enriched structure of nucleic acids, adenylated pro&#8208;proteins (A&#8208;proteins) with dramatically enhanced negative surface charges are first engineered via facile green synthesis. Then, thymidine&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine is developed, which renders strong electrostatic attraction, complementary base pairing, and hydrophobic interaction with A&#8208;proteins to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiencies. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the A&#8208;proteins and consequently promotes the intracellular release of the native proteins. This strategy shows high efficiency and universality for varieties of proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points in mammalian cells. Moreover, it enables highly efficient delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting fusion oncogene EWSR1&#8208;FLI1, leading to pronounced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy against Ewing sarcoma. This study provides a potent and versatile platform for cytosolic protein delivery and gene editing, and may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#9472;Se/Te&#9472;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100 K and 295 K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism &#8211; especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#9472;Se and Te&#9472;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8208;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8208;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8208;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8208;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67 V but also exhibits excellent cyclability(100% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8208;Mn battery high specific energy (600 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8208;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalysts (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this work, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, based on which the in situ synthesis of hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) was readily accomplished without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction&#8208;mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a woolen, spherical, hollow porous structure, and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented Schiff base reaction&#8208;inspired intracellular synthesis system has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening cellular behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>When is a bond broken? The polarizability perspective.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The question of when a chemical bond can be said to be broken is of fundamental chemical interest but has not been widely studied. Herein we propose that the maxima of static polarizability along bond dissociation coordinates naturally define cutoff points for bond rupture, as they represent the onset of localization of shared electron density into constituent fragments. Examples of computed polarizability maxima over the course of bond cleavage in main&#8208;group and transition metal compounds are provided, across covalent, dative and charge&#8208;shift bonds. The behavior along reaction paths is also considered. Overall, the static polarizability is found to be a sensitive reporter of electronic structure reorganization associated with bond stretching, and thus can serve as a metric for describing bond cleavage (or diagnose the absence of a chemical bond).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#160;metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#160;membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN = isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt; 290 with H2 permeance &gt; 520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt; 190 with H2 permeance &gt; 590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring a structurally editable proximal cofactor&#8208;like module to construct an artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent novel strategy for constructing  artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that target new&#8208;to&#8208;nature functions use dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs) with catalytic and anchoring groups for converting P450BM3 monooxygenase to a peroxygenase. However, this process requires excess DFSMs (1000 equivalent of P450) owing to their low binding affinity for P450, thus severely limiting its practical application. Herein, structural optimization of the DFSM&#8208;anchoring group considerably enhanced their binding affinity by three orders of magnitude (Kd = ~10&#8208;8 M), thus approximating native cofactors, such as FMN or FAD in flavoenzymes. An artificial cofactor&#8208;driven peroxygenase was, thus, constructed. The co&#8208;crystal structure of P450BM3 bound to a DFSM clearly revealed a pre&#8208;catalytic state in which the DFSM participates in H2O2 activation, thus facilitating peroxygenase activity. Moreover, the increased binding affinity substantially decreases the DFSM load to as low as 2 equivalents of P450, while maintaining increased activity. Furthermore, replacement of catalytic groups showed disparate selectivity and activity for various substrates. This study provides an unprecedented approach for assembling ArMs by binding editable organic cofactors as a co&#8208;catalytic center, thereby increasing the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a cycle life of over 2000 h with a plating areal capacity of 4 mA h cm&#8722;2, and a capacity retention of 83.4% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solution&#8208;Processable Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Photoelectrochemical Sensing of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitive and highly conductive 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded porphyrin framework (FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2) has been constructed with large surface areas, controllable thicknesses, and high area to thickness ratios. A label&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on a screen&#8208;printing electrode with deposited FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 was fabricated that exhibits excellent selectivity, extremely low detection limit (2.3&#8197;ppm), and long&#8208;term working stability (&gt;30&#8197;days) for CO2.







Abstract
Detecting CO2 in complex gas mixtures is challenging due to the presence of competitive gases in the ambient atmosphere. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) techniques offer a solution, but material selection and specificity remain limiting. Here, we constructed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework material based on a porphyrin tecton decorated with diaminotriazine (DAT) moieties. The DAT moieties on the porphyrin molecules not only facilitate the formation of complementary hydrogen bonds between the tectons but also function as recognition sites in the resulting porous HOF materials for the selective adsorption of CO2. In addition, the in&#8208;plane growth of FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 into anisotropic molecular sheets with large areas of up to 23000&#8197;&#956;m2 and controllable thickness between 0.298 and 2.407&#8197;&#956;m were realized in yields of over 89&#8201;% by a simple solution&#8208;processing method. The FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 can be directly grown and deposited onto different substrates including silica, carbon, and metal oxides by self&#8208;assembly in situ in formic acid. As a proof of concept, a screen&#8208;printing electrode deposited with FDU&#8208;HOF&#8208;2 was fabricate as a label&#8208;free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for CO2 detection. Such a signal&#8208;off PEC sensor exhibits low detection limit for CO2 (2.3&#8197;ppm), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30&#8197;days).

         <title>Multiple Triplet Metal&#8208;Centered Jahn&#8208;Teller Isomers Determine Temperature&#8208;Dependent Luminescence Lifetimes in [Ru(bpy)3]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are in excellent agreement with experimental values only when multiple pathways involving Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers of the 3MC excited states are considered.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that determine the luminescence lifetime of transition metal compounds is key for applications in photocatalysis and photodynamic therapy. Here we show that for 
(bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), the generally accepted idea that emission lifetimes can be controlled optimizing the energy barrier from the emissive triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) state to the thermally&#8208;activated triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state or the energy gap between both states is a misconception. Further, we demonstrate that considering a single relaxation pathway determined from the minimum that is lowest in energy leads to wrong temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes predictions. Instead, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes when an extended kinetic model that includes all the pathways related to multiple Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers and their effective reaction barriers is employed. These concepts are essential to correctly design other luminescent transition metal complexes with tailored emission lifetimes based on theoretical predictions.

         <title>Correlating Polysulfide Solvation Structure with Electrode Kinetics towards Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polysulfide electrode kinetics regarding the sulfur cathode and the lithium anode are promoted as the solvating power of the polysulfide solvation structure increases. Both too fast and slow electrode kinetics induce rapid failure of Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The polysulfide solvation structure with medium solvating power balances the cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are promising due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is crucially affected by the electrode kinetics of lithium polysulfides. Herein, the polysulfide solvation structure is correlated with polysulfide electrode kinetics towards long&#8208;cycling Li&#8722;S batteries. The solvation structure derived from strong solvating power electrolyte induces fast anode kinetics and rapid anode failure, while that derived from weak solvating power electrolyte causes sluggish cathode kinetics and rapid capacity loss. By contrast, the solvation structure derived from medium solvating power electrolyte balances cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of Li&#8722;S batteries. Li&#8722;S coin cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes and high&#8208;S&#8208;loading cathodes deliver 146 cycles and a 338&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pouch cell undergoes stable 30 cycles. This work clarifies the relationship between polysulfide solvation structure and electrode kinetics and inspires rational electrolyte design for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Monitoring the Cascade of Tumor&#8208;specific Immune Response in vivo via Chemoenzymatic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cascade of cellular immune response, including the recruitment and mature of dendritic cell (DC), the activation of T cells in the draining lymph nodes and their transfer to the tumors, is monitored in vivo by integrating the pore&#8208;forming alginate gel promoted DC concentration and maturation with chemoenzymatic proximity&#8208;labeling.







Abstract
Monitoring the highly dynamic and complex immune response remains a great challenge owing to the lack of reliable and specific approaches. Here, we develop a strategy to monitor the cascade of tumor immune response through the cooperation of pore&#8208;forming alginate gel with chemoenzymatic proximity&#8208;labeling. A macroporous gel containing tumor&#8208;associated antigens, adjuvants, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines is utilized to recruit endogenous DCs and enhance their maturation in vivo. The mature DCs are then modified with GDP&#8208;fucose&#8208;fucosyltransferase (GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;Fuct) via the self&#8208;catalysis of fucosyltransferase (Fuct). Following the migration of the obtained Fuct&#8208;DCs to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), the molecular recognition mediated interaction of DCs and T cells leads to the successful decoration of T cells with GDP&#8208;Fuc&#8208;azide through the Fuct catalyzed proximity&#8208;labeling. Therefore, the activated tumor&#8208;specific T cells in dLNs and tumors can be identified through bioorthogonal labeling, opening up a new avenue for studying the immune mechanism of tumors in situ.

&lt;p&gt;The cascade of cellular immune response, including the recruitment and mature of dendritic cell (DC), the activation of T cells in the draining lymph nodes and their transfer to the tumors, is monitored in vivo by integrating the pore-forming alginate gel promoted DC concentration and maturation with chemoenzymatic proximity-labeling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the highly dynamic and complex immune response remains a great challenge owing to the lack of reliable and specific approaches. Here, we develop a strategy to monitor the cascade of tumor immune response through the cooperation of pore-forming alginate gel with chemoenzymatic proximity-labeling. A macroporous gel containing tumor-associated antigens, adjuvants, and pro-inflammatory cytokines is utilized to recruit endogenous DCs and enhance their maturation in vivo. The mature DCs are then modified with GDP-fucose-fucosyltransferase (GDP-Fuc-Fuct) via the self-catalysis of fucosyltransferase (Fuct). Following the migration of the obtained Fuct-DCs to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), the molecular recognition mediated interaction of DCs and T cells leads to the successful decoration of T cells with GDP-Fuc-azide through the Fuct catalyzed proximity-labeling.

         <title>Synthesis of a Porous [14]Annulene Graphene Nanoribbon and a Porous [30]Annulene Graphene Nanosheet on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective syntheses of one&#8208;dimensional graphene nanoribbons containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111) have been achieved. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing and tuning the reaction pathways were proposed.







Abstract
The electrical and mechanical properties of graphene&#8208;based materials can be tuned by the introduction of nanopores, which are sensitively related to the size, morphology, density, and location of nanopores. The synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional graphene nanostructures containing well&#8208;defined nonplanar nanopores has been challenging due to the intrinsic steric hindrance. Herein, we report the selective synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111), starting from a same precursor. The formation of distinct products on the two substrates originates from the different thermodynamics and kinetics of coupling reactions. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing the reaction pathways were proposed. In addition, the combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the electronic structures of porous graphene structures, demonstrating the impact of nonplanar pores on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of molecules.

         <title>Mechanistic Evidence of a Ni(0/II/III) Cycle for Nickel Photoredox Amide Arylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni(0/II/III) cycle is uncovered for a Ni&#8208;photoredox amide arylation reaction. Identification of a precatalyst&#8208;dependent induction period, together with reactivity studies for catalytic intermediates, were key to discerning the mechanism. These findings contrast with other Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8722;N couplings that proceed via Ni(I/III) cycles, highlighting how small changes in reaction conditions can lead to alternative pathways.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the dominance of a Ni(0/II/III) cycle for Ni&#8208;photoredox amide arylation, which contrasts with other Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8208;heteroatom couplings that operate via Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained cycles. The kinetic data gathered when using different Ni precatalysts supports an initial Ni(0)&#8208;mediated oxidative addition into the aryl bromide. Using NiCl2 as the precatalyst resulted in an observable induction period, which was found to arise from a photochemical activation event to generate Ni(0) and to be prolonged by unproductive comproportionation between the Ni(II) precatalyst and the in situ generated Ni(0) active species. Ligand exchange after oxidative addition yields a Ni(II) aryl amido complex, which was identified as the catalyst resting state for the reaction. Stoichiometric experiments showed that oxidation of this Ni(II) aryl amido intermediate was required to yield functionalized amide products. The kinetic data presented supports a rate&#8208;limiting photochemically&#8208;mediated Ni(II/III) oxidation to enable C&#8722;N reductive elimination. An alternative Ni(I/III) self&#8208;sustained manifold was discarded based on EPR and kinetic measurements. The mechanistic insights uncovered herein will inform the community on how subtle changes in Ni&#8208;photoredox reaction conditions may impact the reaction pathway, and have enabled us to include aryl chlorides as coupling partners and to reduce the Ni loading by 20&#8208;fold without any reactivity loss.

         <title>Dynamic Growth of Macroscopically Structured Supramolecular Hydrogels through Orchestrated Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic growth of structured supramolecular hydrogels has been achieved by a simple reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy, reminiscent of the dynamic structural evolution of living organisms. The dynamic growth of the hydrogel has been well explained by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model, which provides a robust approach to program the growth of diverse dynamic hydrogel structures.







Abstract
Living organisms are capable of dynamically changing their structures for adaptive functions through sophisticated reaction&#8208;diffusion processes. Here we show how active supramolecular hydrogels with programmable lifetimes and macroscopic structures can be created by relying on a simple reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy. Two hydrogel precursors (poly(acrylic acid) PAA/CaCl2 and Na2CO3) diffuse from different locations and generate amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles at the diffusional fronts, leading to the formation of hydrogel structures driven by electrostatic interactions between PAA and ACC nanoparticles. Interestingly, the formed hydrogels are capable of autonomously disintegrating over time because of a delayed influx of electrostatic&#8208;interaction inhibitors (NaCl). The hydrogel growth process is well explained by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model which offers a theoretical means to program the dynamic growth of structured hydrogels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual access to dynamic information storage in soft materials using the developed reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy. This work may serve as a starting point for the development of life&#8208;like materials with adaptive structures and functionalities.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific m6A Erasing via Conditionally Stabilized CRISPR&#8208;Cas13b Editor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conditional m6A erasing platform was developed. The FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALKBH5 fusion protein can only be stabilized by Shield&#8208;1 to achieve site&#8208;specific m6A erasing. The removal of Shield&#8208;1 causes rapid degradation and release of the dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser from target RNAs, while the reversal of m6A editing is much slower, providing an opportunity to study the m6A with minimal steric interference from the bulky dCas13b fusion proteins.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) on RNAs plays an important role in regulating various biological processes and CRIPSR technology has been employed for programmable m6A editing. However, the bulky size of CRISPR protein and constitutively expressed CRISPR/RNA editing enzymes can interfere with the native function of target RNAs and cells. Herein, we reported a conditional m6A editing platform (FKBP*&#8208;dCas13b&#8208;ALK) based on a ligand stabilized dCas13 editor. The inducible expression of this m6A editing system was achieved by adding or removing the Shield&#8208;1 molecule. We further demonstrated that the targeted recruitment of dCas13b&#8208;m6A eraser fusion protein and site&#8208;specific m6A erasing were achieved under the control of Shield&#8208;1. Moreover, the release and degradation of dCas13b fusion protein occurred faster than the restoration of m6A on the target RNAs after Shield&#8208;1 removal, which provides an ideal opportunity to study the m6A function with minimal steric interference from bulky dCas13b fusion protein.

         <title>A Nitro&#8208;Modified Luminescent Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Non&#8208;Contact and High&#8208;Contrast Sensing of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;contact and high&#8208;contrast visible aromatic amine sensing in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported for the first time. Direct observation of host&#8211;guest co&#8208;crystal structures is achieved, revealing a conversion from charge transfer to charge separation assisted by both the stereo molecular core and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions with nitro groups, further making this HOF a multifunctional platform for versatile enriched applications.







Abstract
The global demand for intelligent sensing of aromatic amines has consistently increased due to concerns about health and the environment. Efforts to improve material design and understand mechanisms have been made, but highly efficient non&#8208;contact sensing with host&#8211;guest structures remains a challenge. Herein, we report the first example of non&#8208;contact, high&#8208;contrast sensing of aromatic amines in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on a nitro&#8208;modified stereo building block. Direct observation of binding interactions of trapped amines is achieved, leading to charge separation&#8208;induced emission quenching between host and guests. Non&#8208;contact sensing of aniline and diphenylamine is realized with quenching efficiencies up to 91.7&#8201;% and 97.0&#8201;%, which shows potential for versatile applications. This work provides an inspiring avenue to engineer multifunctional HOFs via co&#8208;crystal preparations, thus enriching applications of porous materials with explicit mechanisms.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Membranes for Drinking Water Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, etc. This review focuses on the progress and advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production, including preparations, separation mechanisms, and applications.







Abstract
The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.

         <title>Active Sites Decorated Nonpolar Pore&#8208;Based MOF for One&#8208;step Acquisition of C2H4 and Recovery of C3H6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the nonpolar pore surfaces with accessible N/O active sites, a new metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB can realize one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 mixtures as well as recovery of C3H6 from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures around room temperatures.







Abstract
Herein, a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB with accessible N/O active sites in nonpolar pore surfaces was reported for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H6 or C3H6 mixtures as well as recovery of C3H6 from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures. The MOF exhibits the favorable C2H6 and C3H6 uptakes (&gt;100&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K under 100&#8197;kPa) as well as selective adsorption of C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4. The C3H6&#8208; and C2H6&#8208;selective feature were investigated detailedly by experimental tests as well as sorption kinetic studyies. Molecular modelling revealed the multiple interactions between C3H6 or C2H6 molecules and methyl groups as well as triazine rings in pores. Zn&#8208;BPZ&#8208;TATB not only can directly generate 323.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 15.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) C2H4 from C3H6/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, but also provide a large high&#8208;purity (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%) C3H6 recovery capacity of 60.1&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 from C3H6/C2H4 mixtures. More importantly, the high&#8208;purity C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%) and C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) with the productivities of 38.2 and 12.7&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 can be simultaneously obtained from C2H6/C3H6/C2H4 mixtures through a single adsorption/desorption cycle.

         <title>Defect Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Accelerated Structural Transformation for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of unsaturated metal sites in MOFs can accelerate the structural transformation to metal oxyhydroxides with abundant oxygen vacancies, which exhibit much higher OER catalytic activity compared with non&#8208;defective MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been increasingly applied in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the surface of MOFs usually undergoes structural transformation to form metal oxyhydroxides to serve as catalytically active sites. However, the controllable regulation of the reconstruction process of MOFs remains as a great challenge. Here we report a defect engineering strategy to facilitate the structural transformation of MOFs to metal oxyhydroxides during OER with enhanced activity. Defective MOFs (denoted as NiFc&#8242;xFc1&#8208;x) with abundant unsaturated metal sites are constructed by mixing ligands of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (Fc&#8242;) and defective ferrocene carboxylic acid (Fc). NiFc&#8242;xFc1&#8208;x series are more prone to be transformed to metal oxyhydroxides compared with the non&#8208;defective MOFs (NiFc&#8242;). Moreover, the as&#8208;formed metal oxyhydroxides derived from defective MOFs contain more oxygen vacancies. NiFc&#8242;Fc grown on nickel foam exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 213&#8197;mV at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to that of undefective NiFc&#8242;. Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that the abundant oxygen vacancies in the derived metal oxyhydroxides facilitate the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates on active centers, thus significantly improving the OER activity.

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective acylboration of 1,3&#8208;butadienylboronate with acyl fluorides is shown. The reaction provided (Z)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones bearing an &#945;&#8208;tertiary stereocenter with high Z&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivities. Highly enantioenriched (E)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones can also be obtained with excellent E&#8208;selectivity via Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization from the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
We report herein a Cu&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective acylboration of 1,3&#8208;butadienylboronate with acyl fluorides. Under the developed conditions, the reactions provide (Z)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones bearing an &#945;&#8208;tertiary stereocenter with high Z&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivities. While direct access to highly enantioenriched E&#8208;isomers was not successful, we showed that such molecules can be synthesized with excellent E&#8208;selectivity and optical purities via Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization from the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers. The orthogonal chemical reactivities of the functional groups embedded in the ketone products allow for diverse chemoselective transformations, which provides a valuable platform for further derivatization.

         <title>Interfacial Water Tuning by Intermolecular Spacing for Stable CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toluene&#8208;modified Cu (T&#8722;Cu) presents a suitable intermolecular spacing for enriching CO2 and retarding water transport, as well as forming a hydrophobic interface to inhibit cathodic corrosion, thus leading to high activity and enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products is a promising approach for utilization of renewable energy, in which the interfacial water quantity is critical for both the C2+ product selectivity and the stability of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalytic sites. Functionalization of long&#8208;chain alkyl molecules on a catalyst surface can help to increase its stability, while it also tends to block the transport of water, thus inhibiting the C2+ product formation. Herein, we demonstrate the fine tuning of interfacial water by surface assembly of toluene on Cu nanosheets, allowing for sustained and enriched CO2 supply but retarded water transfer to catalytic surface. Compared to bare Cu with fast cathodic corrosion and long&#8208;chain alkyl&#8208;modified Cu with main CO product, the toluene assembly on Cu nanosheet surface enabled a high Faradaic efficiency of 78&#8201;% for C2+ and a partial current density of 1.81&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The toluene&#8208;modified Cu catalyst further exhibited highly stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion of 400&#8197;h in a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer, suggesting the attractive feature for both efficient C2+ selectivity and excellent stability.

         <title>Detection of Unfolded Cellular Proteins Using Nanochannel Arrays with Probe&#8208;Functionalized Outer Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a platform to detect unfolded proteins through electrical and optical signals using a nanochannel array with outer&#8208;surface probes. The platform has the ability to differentiate folded and unfolded states of proteins based on the exposure of a single cysteine thiol group, allowing the distinction between normal cells and Huntington's disease mutant cells. This work provides an approach for analyzing proteins with distinct conformations.







Abstract
Nanochannel technology has emerged as a powerful tool for label&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of protein folding/unfolding status. However, utilizing the inner walls of a nanochannel array may cause multiple events even for proteins with the same conformation, posing challenges for accurate identification. Herein, we present a platform to detect unfolded proteins through electrical and optical signals using nanochannel arrays with outer&#8208;surface probes. The detection principle relies on the specific binding between the maleimide groups in outer&#8208;surface probes and the protein cysteine thiols that induce changes in the ionic current and fluorescence intensity responses of the nanochannel array. By taking advantage of this mechanism, the platform has the ability to differentiate folded and unfolded state of proteins based on the exposure of a single cysteine thiol group. The integration of these two signals enhances the reliability and sensitivity of the identification of unfolded protein states and enables the distinction between normal cells and Huntington's disease mutant cells. This study provides an effective approach for the precise analysis of proteins with distinct conformations and holds promise for facilitating the diagnoses of protein conformation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Vicinal Di&#8208;Carbo&#8208;Functionalization of Indoles: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective vicinal di&#8208;carbo&#8208;functionalization of indoles has been realized by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The C1&#8208;substituted NBE plays a key role promoting the turnover&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step.







Abstract
Methods that can simultaneously install multiple different functional groups to heteroarenes via C&#8722;H functionalizations are valuable for complex molecule synthesis, which, however, remain challenging to realize. Here we report the development of vicinal di&#8208;carbo&#8208;functionalization of indoles in a site&#8208; and regioselective manner, enabled by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The reaction is initiated by the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C3&#8208;metalation and specifically promoted by the C1&#8208;substituted NBEs. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a good substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The resulting C2&#8208;arylated C3&#8208;alkenylated indoles can be converted to diverse synthetically useful scaffolds. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic study reveals the unique role of the C1&#8208;substituted NBE in accelerating the turnover&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109 &#177; 1%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors.&#160; Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group.&#160; We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Observation of Evolving H2 and Solid Electrolyte Interphase Development at Potassium Insertion Materials within Highly Concentrated Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Properties of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) found in a highly concentrated K(FSA)0.6(OTf)0.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1H2O electrolyte are being revealed through advanced in situ methods. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) reveals a passivating but discontinuous SEI film. Operando mass spectrometry (OEMS) measurements confirm a shift in the evolution of detectable H2 from &#8722;0.9&#8197;V to &lt;&#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is key to stable, high voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as a protective barrier that prevents electrolyte decomposition. The SEI is thought to play a similar role in highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) for emerging aqueous batteries, but its properties remain unknown. In this work, we utilized advanced scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and operando electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) techniques to gain deeper insight into the SEI that occurs within highly concentrated WISEs. As a model, we focus on a 55&#8197;mol/kg K(FSA)0.6(OTf)0.4 electrolyte and a 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide negative electrode. For the first time, our work showed distinctly passivating structures with slow apparent electron transfer rates alike to the SEI found in LIBs. In situ analyses indicated stable passivating structures when PTCDI was stepped to low potentials (&#8776;&#8722;1.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl). However, the observed SEI was discontinuous at the surface and H2 evolution occurred as the electrode reached more extreme potentials. OEMS measurements further confirmed a shift in the evolution of detectable H2 from &#8722;0.9&#8197;V to &lt;&#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl when changing from dilute to concentrated electrolytes. In all, our work shows a combined approach of traditional battery measurements with in situ analyses for improving characterization of other unknown SEI structures.

         <title>Trimethylsilyl Chloride Aids in Solubilization of Oxidative Addition Intermediates from Zinc Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widely used activating agent for metal powders, trimethylsilyl chloride, creates an efficient synthesis of organometallic reagents by increasing their solubility. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is developed to provide molecular fingerprints that characterize intermediates and products, enabling mechanistic determination.







Abstract
Trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) is commonly used to &#8220;activate&#8221; metal(0) powders toward oxidative addition of organohalides, but knowledge of its mechanism remains limited by the inability to characterize chemical intermediates under reaction conditions. Here, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) overcomes these prior limitations and shows that TMSCl aids in solubilization of the organozinc intermediate from zinc(0) metal after oxidative addition, a previously unknown mechanistic role. This mechanistic role is in contrast to previously known roles for TMSCl before the oxidative addition step. To achieve this understanding, FLIM, a tool traditionally used in biology, is developed to characterize intermediates during a chemical reaction&#8212;thus revealing mechanistic steps that are unobservable without fluorescence lifetime data. These findings impact organometallic reagent synthesis and catalysis by providing a previously uncharacterized mechanistic role for a widely used activating agent, an understanding of which is suitable for revising activation models and for developing strategies to activate currently unreactive metals.

         <title>Proteomics&#8208;Based Discovery of First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Chemical Probes for Programmed Cell Death Protein 2 (PDCD2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;in&#8208;class programmed cell death protein 2 (PDCD2) degrader, 10&#8201;e, was developed by combination of mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics with a concise structure&#8208;degradation relationship campaign. Our work provides valuable tool compounds for PDCD2 to the scientific community and highlights that combination of proteomics technology with chemical optimization can be a powerful approach and a useful supplement for chemical probes discovery.







Abstract
Chemical probes are essential tools for understanding biological systems and for credentialing potential biomedical targets. Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) is a member of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl&#8208;2) family of proteins, which are critical regulators of apoptosis. Here we report the discovery and characterization of 10&#8201;e, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule degrader of PDCD2. We discovered this PDCD2 degrader by serendipity using a chemical proteomics approach, in contrast to the conventional approach for making bivalent degraders starting from a known binding ligand targeting the protein of interest. Using 10&#8201;e as a pharmacological probe, we demonstrate that PDCD2 functions as a critical regulator of cell growth by modulating the progression of the cell cycle in T lymphoblasts. Our work provides a useful pharmacological probe for investigating PDCD2 function and highlights the use of chemical proteomics to discover selective small molecule degraders of unanticipated targets.

         <title>Expanding Reaction Horizons: Evidence of the 5&#8208;Deazaflavin Radical Through Photochemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) NMR spectroscopy, we found unambiguous evidence of a one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced 5&#8208;deazaFMN species. Time&#8208;resolved experiments provide a hyperfine mapping for the protons in the aromatic moiety; the relative isotropic hyperfine couplings are correlated to data from density functional theory.







Abstract
Deazaflavins are important analogues of the naturally occurring flavins: riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The use of 5&#8208;deazaflavin as a replacement coenzyme in a number of flavoproteins has proven particularly valuable in unraveling and manipulating their reaction mechanisms. It was frequently reported that one&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactions in flavoproteins are impeded with 5&#8208;deazaflavin as the cofactor. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the 5&#8208;deazaflavin radical is significantly less stable compared to the respective flavin semiquinone and quickly re&#8208;oxidizes or undergoes disproportionation. The long&#8208;standing paradigm of 5&#8208;deazaflavin being solely a two&#8208;electron/hydride acceptor/donor&#8212;&#8220;a nicotinamide in flavin clothing&#8221;&#8212;needs to be re&#8208;evaluated now with the indirect observation of a one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced (paramagnetic) species using photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole Cyanine Enables the NIR&#8208;photosensitized Radical and Thiol&#8208;ene Polymerizations at 940&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine cyanine with tailored solubility and redox properties promotes an efficient photoelectron transfer in a three&#8208;component photoinitiating system allowing the regeneration of the cationic dye. This system is used to perform radical and thiol&#8208;ene polymerizations with conversions up to 100&#8201;% upon near&#8208;infrared LED irradiation.







Abstract
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing heptamethine (HM+) incorporating three bulky benzo[cd]indole heterocycles was designed to efficiently prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the dye, which results in a strong enhancement of its photoinitiating reactivity as compared to a parent bis&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine (HMCl+) used as a reference system.

&lt;p&gt;An original tris-benzo[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indole heptamethine cyanine with tailored solubility and redox properties promotes an efficient photoelectron transfer in a three-component photoinitiating system allowing the regeneration of the cationic dye. This system is used to perform radical and thiol-ene polymerizations with conversions up to 100&#8201;% upon near-infrared LED irradiation.

&lt;/b&gt;) incorporating three bulky benzo[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indole heterocycles was designed to efficiently prevent self-aggregation of the dye, which results in a strong enhancement of its photoinitiating reactivity as compared to a parent bis-benzo[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indole heptamethine (&lt;b&gt;HMCl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) used as a reference system. In this context, we highlight an efficient free-radical NIR-polymerization up to a 100&#8201;% acrylates C=C bonds conversion even under air conditions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiple Phosphorescence from Functionalized Corannulenes: Temperature Sensing and Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corannulene&#8208;based luminophores that exhibit room&#8208;temperature multiple phosphoresce are reported for the first time. We demonstrate utility of these room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials in an afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting diode and for optical temperature sensing stemming from a change in the ratio of multiple phosphorescence yields as a function of temperatures.







Abstract
Corannulene&#8208;derived materials have been extensively explored in energy storage and solar cells, however, are rarely documented as emitters in light&#8208;emitting sensors and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), due to low exciton utilization. Here, we report a family of multi&#8208;donor and acceptor (multi&#8208;D&#8208;A) motifs, TCzPhCor, TDMACPhCor, and TPXZPhCor, using corannulene as the acceptor and carbazole (Cz), 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC), and phenoxazine (PXZ) as the donor, respectively. By decorating corannulene with different donors, multiple phosphorescence is realized. Theoretical and photophysical investigations reveal that TCzPhCor shows room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from the lowest&#8208;lying T1; however, for TDMACPhCor, dual RTP originating from a higher&#8208;lying T1 (T1H) and a lower&#8208;lying T1 (T1L) can be observed, while for TPXZPhCor, T1H&#8208;dominated RTP occurs resulting from a stabilized high&#8208;energy T1 geometry. Benefiting from the high&#8208;temperature sensitivity of TPXZPhCor, high color&#8208;resolution temperature sensing is achieved. Besides, due to degenerate S1 and T1H states of TPXZPhCor, the first corannulene&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed afterglow OLEDs is investigated. The afterglow OLED with TPXZPhCor shows a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) and a luminance (Lmax) of 3.3&#8201;% and 5167&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, which is one of the most efficient afterglow RTP OLEDs reported to date.

         <title>Oriented Ultrathin &#960;&#8208;complexation MOF Membrane for Ethylene/Ethane and Flue Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;scale structure optimization strategy gives an oriented ultrathin NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane chelated with coordinatively unsaturated Cu ions. Cu ions act as coordinating modulator and recognition sites, enabling the formation of ultrathin nanosheets and membranes. They also promote &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions with C2H4 and CO2, leading to enhanced performance for ethylene/ethane and flue gas separations.







Abstract
Rational design and engineering of high&#8208;performance molecular sieve membranes towards C2H4/C2H6 and flue gas separations remain a grand challenge to date. In this study, through combining pore micro&#8208;environment engineering with meso&#8208;structure manipulation, highly c&#8208;oriented sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm&#8208;thick Cu@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane was successfully prepared. Coordinatively unsaturated Cu ions immobilized in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 framework enabled high&#8208;affinity &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions with C2H4, resulting in an C2H4/C2H6 selectivity approaching 13.6, which was 9.4&#8197;times higher than that of pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane; moreover, benefiting from &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between CO2 and Cu(I) sites, our membrane displayed superior CO2/N2 selectivity of 43.2 with CO2 permeance of 696 GPU, which far surpassed the benchmark of other pure MOF membranes. The above multi&#8208;scale structure optimization strategy is anticipated to present opportunities for significantly enhancing the separation performance of diverse molecular sieve membranes.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile C&#8722;PIII Coupling of Chlorophosphines with Organic Halides: Photoinduced PIII and Aminoalkyl Radical Generation Enabled by Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon irradiation with visible light, neutral pnictogen bonding (PnB) enables single electron transfer (SET) from alkyl amines to chlorophosphines. This process generates PIII radicals and aminoalkyl radicals. Subsequently, the aminoalkyl radicals activate C&#8722;X bonds through halogen atom transfer (XAT). As a result, cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII coupling between chlorophosphines and organic halides is achieved.







Abstract
Pnictogen bonding (PnB) has gained recognition as an appealing strategy for constructing novel architectures and unlocking new properties. Within the synthetic community, the development of a straightforward and much simpler protocol for cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII coupling remains an ongoing challenge with organic halides. In this study, we present a simple strategy for photoinduced PnB&#8208;enabled cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8722;PIII couplings using readily available chlorophosphines and organic halides via merging single electron transfer (SET) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) processes. In this photomediated transformation, the PnB formed between chlorophosphines and alkyl amines facilitates the photogeneration of PIII radicals and &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals through SET. Subsequently, the resulting &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals activate C&#8722;X bonds via XAT, leading to the formation of carbon radicals. This methodology offers operational simplicity and compatibility with both aliphatic and aromatic chlorophosphines and organic halides.

         <title>An Anion&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Function Rotaxane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;controllable rotaxane catalyst has been generated that can selectively catalyze the reaction between trans&#8208;cinnamaldehyde and an aliphatic thiol. The reaction occurs through either a Michael addition or thioacetalation pathway by exposing its dibenzylammonium or imidazolium station, respectively, to the reactants in its two switchable states.







Abstract
In situ switching of the associated anions of a rotaxane catalyst between Cl&#8722; and TFPB&#8722; exposes its dialkylammonium and imidazolium stations, respectively, thereby selectively catalyzing the reactions of a mixture of trans&#8208;cinnamaldehyde and an aliphatic thiol to yield the Michael adduct and the thioacetal product, respectively.

         <title>Reversible Solid&#8211;Solid Conversion of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathodes in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries by Weakly Solvating Ether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) was formed on the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode by utilizing a weakly solvating ether electrolyte with an anion&#8211;rich solvated structure. This CEI layer effectively impedes the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte, thereby inducing a &#8220;solid&#8211;solid&#8221; direct conversion mechanism. Consequently, the SPAN cathode demonstrates excellent cycle reversibility and achieves an extended lifespan.







Abstract
Despite carbonate electrolytes exhibiting good stability to sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), their chemical incompatibility with lithium (Li) metal anode leads to poor electrochemical performance of Li||SPAN full cells. While the SPAN employs conventional ether electrolytes that suffer from the shuttle effect, leading to rapid capacity fading. Here, we tailor a dilute electrolyte based on a low solvating power ether solvent that is both compatible with SPAN and Li metal. Unlike conventional ether electrolytes, the weakly solvating ether electrolyte enables SPAN to undergo reversibly &#8220;solid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion. It features an anion&#8211;rich solvation structure that allows for the formation of a robust cathode electrolyte interphase on the SPAN, effectively blocking the dissolution of polysulfides into the bulk electrolyte and avoiding the shuttle effect. What's more, the unique electrolyte chemistry endowed Li ions with fast electroplating kinetics and induced high reversibility Li deposition/stripping process from 25&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Based on tailored electrolyte, Li||SPAN full cells matched with high loading SPAN cathodes (&#8776;3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil can operate stably over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, Li||SPAN pouch cell under lean electrolyte and 5&#8201;% excess Li conditions can continuously operate stably for over a month.

         <title>Exploiting Chirality in Confined Nanospaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel synthetic strategies for the preparation of chiral supramolecular cages has led in the recent years to a boost on their applications. This minireview highlights some recent examples on the applications that these systems have found in catalysis, sensing and in the development of systems with novel chiral optical activities.







Abstract
Spatial organization using confinement has been of great interest since the early ages of supramolecular chemistry. Application such as sensing, catalysis and delivery are continuously emerging. This minireview highlights the evolution of chiral supramolecular cages (CSC) applications in the fields of catalysis, sensing and chiroptical properties. More in detail, beside the description of the strategies adopted for the preparation of chiral supramolecular cages, either of purely organic supramolecular architectures or prepared using metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds, recent findings on their applications, with particular attention to stereodynamic systems, are presented to highlight the recent scientific interests and the future opportunities.

         <title>Improved Electrocatalytic Activity and Stability by Single Iridium Atoms on Iron&#8208;based Layered Double Hydroxides for Oxygen Evolution</title>

The completed origin of the catalytic performance of Ir/CoFe&#8208;LDH for OER from the points of view of both the active center and the support.







Abstract
Full understanding to the origin of the catalytic performance of a supported nanocatalyst from the points of view of both the active component and support is significant for the achievement of high performance. Herein, based on a model electrocatalyst of single&#8208;iridium&#8208;atom&#8208;doped iron (Fe)&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDH) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we reveal the first completed origin of the catalytic performance of such supported nanocatalysts. Specially, besides the activity enhancement of Ir sites by LDH support, the stability of surface Fe sites is enhanced by doped Ir sites: DFT calculation shows that the Ir sites can reduce the activity and enhance the stability of the nearby Fe sites; while further finite element simulations indicate, the stability enhancement of distant Fe sites could be attributed to the much low concentration of OER reactant (hydroxyl ions, OH&#8722;) around them induced by the much fast consumption of OH&#8722; on highly active Ir sites. These new findings about the interaction between the main active components and supports are applicable in principle to other heterogeneous nanocatalysts and provide a completed understanding to the catalytic performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts.

         <title>A Multidimensional Approach to Modulating Ionizable Lipids for High&#8208;Performing and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a powerful multidimensional design approach for the modulation of ionizable lipids (IL) using one&#8208;step chemistry based on the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction, which enables simplified screening of high&#8208;performing ILs for in vivo mRNA delivery. The inherent structure of ILs, which controls organ&#8208;selective mRNA delivery, and the isomeric design of ILs, which affects the efficacy in vivo, were elucidated for this new IL library.







Abstract
The development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has enabled a successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines. However, disclosure of design principles for the core component&#8208;ionizable lipids (ILs), improving the delivery efficacy and organ targeting of LNPs, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a powerful strategy to modulate ILs in one&#8208;step chemistry using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) under mild conditions. A large IL library of new structures was established simply and efficiently through a multidimensional approach, allowing us to identify the top&#8208;performing ILs in delivering mRNA via the formulated LNPs. Adjusting the skeleton of ILs has transformed the organ&#8208;specific and robust transfection in mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen following different administration routes. Of note, a series of isomeric ILs were prepared and we found that the isomers mattered greatly in the performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Furthermore, owing to the bis&#8208;amide bonds formed in the Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction, the ILs within LNPs may form hydrogen bonding intermolecularly, facilitating the colloidal stabilization of LNPs. This work provides clues to the rapid discovery and rational design of IL candidates, assisting the application of mRNA therapeutics.

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96 nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32 V and achieved a current density of 50 mA/cm2 at only 1.38 V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in&#8208;situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8208;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8208;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8208;O.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8208;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8208; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8208; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8208; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120 cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7 % compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Aldol Condensation for the&#160;Construction of&#160;Organic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldol condensation is a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable method, offering advantages of low complexity, substrate universality, and high efficiency. Over the past decade, it has become popular for creating next&#8208;generation organic functional materials, particularly rigid rod conjugated (semi)conductors. This review focuses on conjugated small&#8208;molecules, oligomers and polymeric (semi)conductors synthesized through aldol condensation, with emphasis on their remarkable features in advancing n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) as well as NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. Coherence character, optical properties, microstructure, and chain conformation are investigated to understand material&#8208;properties relationships. Future applications and challenges in this area are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Transport and Evolution in Ni&#8208;MH Batteries by Neutron Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiency losses due to side reactions are one of the main challenges in battery development. Despite providing valuable insights, the results of standard analysis on the individual components cannot be simply extrapolated to the full operating system. Therefore, non&#8208;destructive, and high resolution approaches that allow the investigation of the full system are desired. Herein, we combined neutron radiography and tomography with electrical monitoring of the state of charge of commercial Ni&#8208;mischmetal hydride batteries, to track the exchange and transport of hydrogen under operating conditions. This non&#8208;destructive approach allowed both the quantification of the hydrogen distribution in the electrodes in 4D, and the distinction between the electrochemically exchanged hydrogen and the hydrogen gas pressure generated by side reactions, as a function of the applied potential and current. One of the most counter&#8208;intuitive observation is that the generation of hydrogen gas during discharge depends on the charging state of the battery. The results presented provide critical new insights in the mechanisms governing the electrochemical processes during Nimischmetal hydride battery operation, and also pave the way for the extrapolation of this approach to the investigation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ions batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method &#8211; all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#160;kPa to 50&#160;kPa lead to better cell growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn = 361.8 kg/mol, &#393; &lt; 1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.</dc:description>

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidically Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the natural confined enzyme on fluidic cell membrane, afluidically confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamers&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system with accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER can rapidly identified target cells in only 20 min, and achieved over 80% recognition efficiency with only 0.1% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and high selectivity of 97.1%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA = pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8211;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched product. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8211;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their sustainability and structural tunability. However, many OEMs suffer from low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule called 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) with catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone coupling functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. Through extensive analysis using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, ATR&#8208;FTIR, and Raman techniques, we have determined that the abundant coupling function groups and imine redox&#8208;active moieties on HATN&#8208;6OH enable a nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, resulting in a high specific capacity for sodium ion storage. Furthermore, the &#960;&#8208;&#960; coupling interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules contribute to its resilient structural and chemical stability during cycling. As a result, our HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibits remarkable specific capacity (554 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1), excellent rate capability (202 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1) in SIBs. This study highlights the importance of synergistic coupling of redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs in simultaneously enhancing capacity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. And based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to  interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. Interestingly, the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs gradually enhances as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient up to 0.90.This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescence probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the &#8220;Solid&#8211;Liquid&#8211;Solid&#8221; Conversion Reaction via Bifunctional Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8211;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3 mol L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8211;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8208;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8208;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8208;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8208;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8208;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8208;Cur to form Cu&#8208;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.</dc:description>

In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion-exchange strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselectivity of C&#8208;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98:2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8211;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt; 80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8211;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8208;Au(III)&#8208;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advantages of using C&#8722;F bonds as functional handles for chemical synthesis. Specific examples are used to illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can streamline small molecule synthesis and enable new reactions. The goal of this review is to educate chemists on the opportunities available for incorporating C&#8722;F bonds in synthetic route planning and for exploiting the unique mechanistic pathways available to C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8722;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8722;F bonds. As such, C&#8722;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advances of defluorinative functionalization are discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8722;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8722;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.

         <title>Non&#8208;Doped Blue AIEgen&#8208;Based OLED with EQE Approaching 10.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue AIEgen of DPDPB&#8208;AC was designed by fusing a hot exciton AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC with a triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion luminogen of DMPPP. When it was used as non&#8208;doped EML of organic light&#8208;emitting diode, an outstanding maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional maximum brightness (Lmax) of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are attractive for the construction of non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owning to their high emission efficiency in the film state. However, the large internal inversion rate (kIC(Tn)) between high&#8208;lying triplet levels (Tn) and Tn&#8208;1 causes a huge loss of triplet excitons, resulting in dissatisfied device performance of these AIEgens&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a blue luminogen of DPDPB&#8208;AC by fusing an AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC and a DMPPP, which feature hot exciton and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion process, respectively. DPDPB&#8208;AC successfully inherits the AIE feature and excellent horizontal dipole orientation of TPB&#8208;AC. Furthermore, it owes smaller kIC(Tn) than TPB&#8208;AC. When DPDPB&#8208;AC was applied in OLED as non&#8208;doped emitting layer, an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 10.3&#8201;% and an exceptional brightness of 69311&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were achieved. The transient electroluminescent measurements and steady&#8208;state dynamic analysis confirm that both TTA and hot exciton processes contribute to such excellent device performance. This work provides a new insight into the design of efficient organic fluorophores by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Induced Isomerization of Prenucleation Clusters During the Prenucleation Stage of CdTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor CdTe quantum dots (QDs), precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) form and isomerize. When the reaction temperature is increased, PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C and isomerizes to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C via PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C. When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample is placed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA), the PCs that have formed transform quickly to their counterpart MSCs.







Abstract
The evolution of prenucleation clusters in the prenucleation stage of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has remained unexplored. With CdTe as a model system, we show that substances form and isomerize prior to the nucleation and growth of QDs. Called precursor compounds (PCs), the prenucleation clusters are relatively optically transparent and can transform to absorbing magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs). When a prenucleation&#8208;stage sample at 25, 45, or 80&#8201;&#176;C is dispersed in a mixture of cyclohexane (CH) and octylamine (OTA) at room temperature, either MSC&#8208;371, MSC&#8208;417, or MSC&#8208;448 evolves with absorption peaking at 371, 417, or 448&#8197;nm, respectively. We propose that PC&#8208;371 forms at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and isomerizes to PC&#8208;417 at 45&#8201;&#176;C and to PC&#8208;448 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The PCs and MSCs are quasi isomers. Relatively large and small amounts of OTA favor PC&#8208;371 and PC&#8208;448 in dispersion, respectively. The present findings suggest the existence of PC&#8208;to&#8208;PC isomerization in the QD prenucleation stage.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctionality of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based textiles encourages innovation of a wearable platform technology capable of sensing, filtration, detoxification, and catalysis. This Review focuses on the implementation of MOFs at the fiber level to form functional components in smart textiles.







Abstract
Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state-of-the-art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF-integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Labeled with Iridium(III) Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium (III) photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid (Ir&#8208;HEcN) targets the solid tumors and produces reactive oxygen species in situ upon photoirradiation, which induces pyroptosis of tumor cells and spontaneous self&#8208;elimination of Ir&#8208;HEcN. The resulting debris further evokes innate and adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Therefore, Ir&#8208;HEcN&#8208;mediated treatment remarkably eradicates solid tumors via enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
Despite metal&#8208;based photosensitizers showing great potential in photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment, the application of the photosensitizers is intrinsically limited by their poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties. Herein, we reported a metal&#8208;based photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid, Ir&#8208;HEcN, via covalent labeling of an iridium(III) photosensitizer to the surface of genetically engineered bacteria. Due to its intrinsic self&#8208;propelled motility and hypoxia tropism, Ir&#8208;HEcN selectively targets and penetrates deeply into tumor tissues. Importantly, Ir&#8208;HEcN is capable of inducing pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death of tumor cells under irradiation, thereby remarkably evoking anti&#8208;tumor innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo and leading to the regression of solid tumors via combinational photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, Ir&#8208;HEcN is the first metal complex decorated bacteria for enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 with CeO2 Catalyst for Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling of N2 and CO2 to urea was realized on ceria catalyst rich in oxygen vacancies. The reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments.







Abstract
The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO2&#8208;x nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H2 (90&#8201;%&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO2&#8208;500 (CeO2 nanorods heated treatment at 500&#8201;&#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5&#8197;&#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO2&#8208;500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments. We hope this work provides important inspiration and guiding significance towards highly efficient photocatalytic synthesis of urea.

         <title>Utilizing the Hofmeister Effect to Induce Hydrogelation of Nonionic Supramolecular Polymers into a Therapeutic Depot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic supramolecular polymers, formed by self&#8208;assembly of drug&#8208;peptide conjugates, can be induced to undergo a sol&#8208;gel transition using the Hofmeister Effect, in which the well&#8208;hydrated anions disrupt the hydration shell around the supramolecular polymers by polarizing the water molecules closely bound to their surfaces.







Abstract
Nonionic hydrogels are of particular interest for long&#8208;term therapeutic implantation due to their minimal immunogenicity relative to their charged counterparts. However, in situ formation of nonionic supramolecular hydrogels under physiological conditions has been a challenging task. In this context, we report on our discovery of salt&#8208;triggered hydrogelation of nonionic supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by self&#8208;assembling prodrug hydrogelators (SAPHs) through the Hofmeister effect. The designed SAPHs consist of two SN&#8208;38 units, which is an active metabolite of the anticancer drug irinotecan, and a short peptide grafted with two or four oligoethylene glycol (OEG) segments. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the resultant nonionic SPs can be triggered to gel upon addition of phosphate salts. Our 1H NMR studies revealed that the added phosphates led to a change in the chemical shift of the methylene protons, suggestive of a disruption of the water&#8208;ether hydrogen bonds and consequent reorganization of the hydration shell surrounding the SPs. This deshielding effect, commensurate with the amount of salt added, likely promoted associative interactions among the SAPH filaments to percolate into a 3D network. The formed hydrogels exhibited a sustained release profile of SN&#8208;38 hydrogelator that acted potently against cancer cells.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of the First Sex&#8208;Inducing Pheromone of a Diatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing sex pheromone was elucidated using metabolomics, labeling experiments, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. The peptide pheromone is active below femtomolar concentrations and synchronizes sexuality in the diatom Seminavis robusta.







Abstract
Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae, responsible for &#8776;20&#8201;% of global photosynthetic CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, we know little about fundamental aspects of their biology, such as their sexual reproduction. Pheromone&#8208;mediated chemical communication is crucial for successful mating. An attraction pheromone was identified in the diatom Seminavis robusta, but metabolites priming cells for sex and synchronizing search and mating behavior remained elusive. These sex&#8208;inducing pheromones (SIP) induce cell cycle arrest and trigger the production of the attraction pheromone. Here we describe the challenging structure elucidation of an S. robusta SIP. Guided by metabolomics, a candidate metabolite was identified and elucidated by labeling experiments, NMR, ESI MSn analyses, and chemical transformations. The use of negative ion mode MS was essential to decipher the unprecedented hydroxyproline and &#946;&#8208;sulfated aspartate&#8208;containing cyclic heptapeptide that acts in femtomolar concentrations.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase was engineered for efficient N&#8208;alkylation to access densely functionalized non&#8208;canonical amino acids. Mechanistic analysis guided preparative scale synthesis, adding a valuable new enzyme to the biocatalytic toolbox.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic N&#8208;substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acids. In this study, we used directed evolution to engineer the &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of l&#8208;serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;&#8208;substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

However, there are few examples of biocatalytic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;-diamino acids. In this study, we used directed evolution to engineer the &#946;-subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re-entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;-substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a gram scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable&#160;the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#160;cleavage of two&#160;geminal&#160;bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8211;C/C&#8211;Si or C&#8211;C/C&#8211;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8211;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8211;C and C&#8211;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8208;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential at binding biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A helical aromatic foldamer was identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8208;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyle nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#181;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#181;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal&#8208;metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne&#8208;containing clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregation, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80%, much better than that of 17.91% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence CuI/CuIII Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Non&#8208;innocent Ligand for Multielectron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two novel three&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;benzoquinoid metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu4L3]n and [Cu4L3&#183;Cu(iq)3]n (LH4 = 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrahydroxybenzene, iq = isoquinoline). Spectroscopic techniques and computational studies reveal the unprecedented mixed valency in MOFs, formal Cu(I)/Cu(III). This is the first time that formally Cu(III) species are witnessed in metal&#8211;organic extended solids. The coordination between the mixed&#8208;valence metal and redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent ligand L, which promotes through&#8208;bond charge transfer between Cu metal sites, allows better metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap of the d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, leading to strong long&#8208;range delocalization and semiconducting behavior. Our findings highlight the significance of the unique mixed valency between formal Cu(I) and highly&#8208;covalent Cu(III), non&#8208;innocent ligand, and pore environments of these bench stable Cu(III)&#8208;containing frameworks on multielectron transfer and electrochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2&#160;Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emission and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We prove that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in&#8208;situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote formation of *OCHO intermediate, but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel non&#8208;covalent interaction that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between the two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibited a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35%, compared to 10.12% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis revealed that a "cyclohexyl&#8208;like" structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent molecular interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either stable against lithium metal anode or stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. An example is the sulfone solvent. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the solvent electrons by introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMBs under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21 mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50 &#956;m Li) with 90% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>blem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) suggest that Pb acted as oxygen&#8208;rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb1.04&#8208;Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10 A mgRu&#8208;1 and 5.55 mA cm&#8722;2, which are ~10 and ~31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru&#8208;based catalyst with high activity and strong CO&#8208;resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.</dc:description>

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30 mS cm&#8208;1 at 30 &#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Li/ LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8208;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8208;O&#8208;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Nanohoop Polymers based on Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalenes for Charge Storage in Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiaromatic dibenzopentalenes in nanohoop polymers invoke an intriguing interplay of linear vs. radial conjugation, depending on the electronic nature of the comomoner unit, and improved charge storage properties due to the presence of the nanohoops compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer.







Abstract
With their bent &#960;&#8208;systems, cyclic conjugation and inherent cavities, conjugated nanohoops are attractive for organic electronics applications. For ease of processing and morphological stability, an incorporation into polymers is desirable, but to date was hampered with few exceptions by synthetic difficulties. We herein present a unique strategy for the synthesis of conjugated nanohoop polymers using a dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) as central connector. We demonstrate this versatility by synthesizing three electronically diverse copolymers with dithienyldiketo(pyrrolopyrrol), fluorene and carbazole comonomers, and report the first donor&#8208;acceptor nanohoop polymer. Optoelectronic investigations reveal the prevalence of cyclic or linear conjugation, depending on the comonomer unit, and ambipolar electrochemical properties through the antiaromatic character of the DBP units. As the first report on using conjugated nanohoops for charge storage as positive electrode materials, we show a significant improvement in battery performance in a nanohoop&#8208;containing polymer compared to an equivalent nanohoop&#8208;free reference polymer. We believe this study will pave the way for the synthesis of a diverse range of nanohoop polymers and further stimulate their exploration for charge storage in batteries.

         <title>An S=1 Iron(IV) Intermediate Revealed in a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first non&#8208;heme enzymatic S=1 Fe(IV) intermediate is discovered via transient kinetics and spectroscopic (M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, and XANES) characterizations. This novel species is a key intermediate to enable the oxidative carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation in the biosynthesis of ovothiol&#8197;A.







Abstract
Ergothioneine (ESH) and ovothiol A (OSHA) are two natural thiol&#8208;histidine derivatives. ESH has been implicated as a longevity vitamin and OSHA inhibits the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma. The key biosynthetic step of ESH and OSHA in the aerobic pathways is the O2&#8208;dependent C&#8722;S bond formation catalyzed by non&#8208;heme iron enzymes (e.g., OvoA in ovothiol biosynthesis), but due to the lack of identification of key reactive intermediate the mechanism of this novel reaction is unresolved. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a kinetically competent S=1 iron(IV) intermediate supported by a four&#8208;histidine ligand environment (three from the protein residues and one from the substrate) in enabling C&#8722;S bond formation in OvoA from Methyloversatilis thermotoleran, which represents the first experimentally observed intermediate spin iron(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron enzymes. Results reported in this study thus set the stage to further dissect the mechanism of enzymatic oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the OSHA biosynthesis pathway. They also afford new opportunities to study the structure&#8208;function relationship of high&#8208;valent iron intermediates supported by a histidine rich ligand environment.

         <title>Bimetallic Anionic Organic Frameworks with Solid&#8208;State Cation Conduction for Charge Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP metal&#8211;organic frameworks, comprising a cation&#8208;rich phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, exhibit a high cation content, possess two distinct binding sites (&#8722;O[Li/Na]A and &#8722;O[Li/Na]B) and reversible redox chemistry. These MOFs demonstrate solid&#8208;state conduction of Li+ and Na+ ions, making them the first reported MOFs with such properties.







Abstract
A new phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, with the general formula of A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP (wherein A is Li+ or Na+, and DOBDP6&#8722; is the 2,5&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediphosphate ligand) is prepared and characterized for energy storage applications. With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non&#8208;solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8208; phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li+ and Na+ shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature. As positive electrode material, Li4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP delivers a specific capacity of 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high average discharge potential of 3.2&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) with 90&#8201;% of capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles. The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed&#8208;ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.

         <title>Evading the Illusions: Identification of False Peaks in Micro&#8208;Raman Spectroscopy and Guidelines for Scientific Best Practice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy is a great analysis tool but the spectra are sometimes difficult to interpret due to the occurrence of spectral artefacts. This paper dives into the details of many spurious signals and spectral artefacts that occur in Raman spectra, explains their origin, and provides the tools to identify and avoid them.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;Raman spectroscopy is an important analytical tool in a large variety of science disciplines. The technique is suitable for both identification of chemical bonds and studying more detailed phenomena like molecular interactions, material strain, crystallinity, defects, and bond formations. Raman scattering has one major weakness however: it is a very low probability process. The weak signals require very sensitive detection systems, which leads to a high probability of picking up signals from origins other than the sample. This complicates the analysis of the results and increases the risk of misinterpreting data. This work provides an overview of the sources of spurious signals occurring in Raman spectra, including photoluminescence, cosmic rays, stray light, artefacts caused by spectrometer components, and signals from other compounds in or surrounding the sample. The origins of these false Raman peaks are explained and means to identify and counteract them are provided.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic media is irrepressible. Here, we report an imidazole&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst, which exhibits a better performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in an acidic electrolyte than a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (&#8776;100&#8201;%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Decarboxylative Olefination Driven by Alternating Polarity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical conversion of unactivated carboxylic acids to olefins under alternating polarity is reported. By modulating electrode surface quality and local acidity, chemoselective Hofer&#8208;Moest reactivity is realized on conventionally difficult substrates, including primary and secondary unactivated carboxylic acids. This simple protocol is exceptionally scalable (1&#8197;kg) and cost&#8208;effective.







Abstract
A mild, scalable (kg) metal&#8208;free electrochemical decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to olefins is disclosed. Numerous applications are presented wherein this transformation can simplify alkene synthesis and provide alternative synthetic access to valuable olefins from simple carboxylic acid feedstocks. This robust method relies on alternating polarity to maintain the quality of the electrode surface and local pH, providing a deeper understanding of the Hofer&#8208;Moest process with unprecedented chemoselectivity.

         <title>Analysis of Rhizonin Biosynthesis Reveals Origin of Pharmacophoric Furylalanine Moieties in Diverse Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic origin of rhizonins, hepatotoxic cyclopeptides with unusual 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, has been elucidated. Functional analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, labeling experiments, and heterologous reconstitution revealed the biosynthetic precursors and a novel dioxygenase (RhzB) that catalyzes Fua formation and allowed the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster by genome mining.







Abstract
Rhizonin A and B are hepatotoxic cyclopeptides produced by bacterial endosymbionts (Mycetohabitans endofungorum) of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. Their toxicity critically depends on the presence of 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, which also occur in pharmaceutically relevant cyclopeptides of the endolide and bingchamide families. The biosynthesis and incorporation of Fua by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), however, has remained elusive. By genome sequencing and gene inactivation we elucidated the gene cluster responsible for rhizonin biosynthesis. A suite of isotope labeling experiments identified tyrosine and l&#8208;DOPA as Fua precursors and provided the first mechanistic insight. Bioinformatics, mutational analysis and heterologous reconstitution identified dioxygenase RhzB as necessary and sufficient for Fua formation. RhzB is a novel type of heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenases (HDAO) that enabled the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster through genome mining.

However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination.

         <title>Nucleophilic Carbenes Derived from Dichloromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalysts promote cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane as a methylene source. An asymmetric variant using a chiral pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand provides access to pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aryl cyclopropyl carboxylates in highly enantioenriched form. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a nucleophilic nickel carbene that reacts by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination pathway.







Abstract
Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination mechanism. DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative NADH photosynthesis system is developed, in which the oxidation of biomass derivatives is used as an electron supply module (ESM) to supply electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is used as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Benefiting from the inhibition of REM, the NADH photosynthesis system exhibits a two&#8208;fold enhancement in the NADH yield compared with the system without REM.







Abstract
Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the oxidation of biomass derivatives is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is designed as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a &#8776;2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1&#8201;% vs. 30.7&#8201;%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50&#8197;times and 2.54&#8197;times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Mechanisms of Biomolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Investigated Through In Situ Observations of Structures and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach for the synthesis of hierarchical biomaterials. Hence,it is essential to directly observe the assembly dynamics and structural evolution using in situ characterization approaches. These measurements reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism for improving the accuracy of biomaterials design.







Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly of hierarchical materials is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach to synthesizing across scales with considerable energy, health, environment, sustainability, and information technology applications. To achieve desired functions in biomaterials, it is essential to directly observe assembly dynamics and structural evolutions that reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism. This review will summarize the current understanding of biomolecular assembly mechanisms based on in situ characterization and discuss the broader significance and achievements of newly gained insights. In addition, we will also introduce how emerging deep learning/machine learning&#8208;based approaches, multiparametric characterization, and high&#8208;throughput methods can boost the development of biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. The objective of this review is to accelerate the development of in situ characterization approaches for biomolecular self&#8208;assembly and to inspire the next generation of biomimetic materials.

         <title>Modulating Ligand&#8208;Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo&#8208;polymers. The reversible sorting process can be conducted through a typical solvent extraction procedure.







Abstract
The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, &#8776;2&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford the corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned by the recipe of the star polymer mixtures used. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction procedure. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted through the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.

Abstract
We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the development of a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox-active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity-mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme was derived from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool by forcing the sequences to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent in aqueous solution. The DNAzyme was isolated via a counter&#8208;selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by a positive selection in the same buffered solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO, and its activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of the cosolvent.







Abstract
Engineering functional nucleic acids that are active under unusual conditions will not only reveal their hidden abilities but also lay the groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO. This experiment led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35&#8201;% DMSO for its catalytic activity and exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis, and its activity is enhanced by monovalent ions. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived. This work demonstrates that highly functional, organic solvent&#8208;dependent DNAzymes can be isolated from random&#8208;sequence DNA libraries via forced in vitro selection, thus expanding the capability and potential utility of catalytic DNA.

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by the structure and working principle of biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting devices have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of structural and functional maladaptive changes in neural circuits after a variety of CNS trauma and diseases.







Abstract
Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50&#8197;&#956;m, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence single&#8208;atom sites are induced and stabilized by constructing a metalloid tungsten carbide support (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd), leading to the realization of superior mass activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Volmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.

         <title>Manganese/Cobalt Bimetallic Relay Catalysis for Divergent Dehydrogenative Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for the divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products were concisely constructed.







Abstract
The involvement of manganese radical for halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions has been esteemed as one reliable method but encountered with limited catalytic models. In this paper, a novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H2 as the by&#8208;product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step&#8208;forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.

A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the by-product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step-forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Anisotropic Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;dioxin linked covalent organic framework, denoted as HD&#8208;COF, was designed, and synthesized. The unique &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages in the HD&#8208;COF structure led to efficient anisotropic charge transport. In situ formed HD&#8208;COF film demonstrated enhanced electric conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with magic blue.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of immense interest for applications in optoelectronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Formal [1,3]&#8208;Aryl Shift within Molecular Bows</title>

         <dc:description>
Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach was proposed to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows with integrated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties.







Abstract
Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MBs through tethering the bow limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208; to the ortho&#8208;position. Through the use of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy strategy improves the Li+ diffusion and oxygen lattice stability of the Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalts cathode during charging, and enables multiple 3d TM to participate in charge compensation cooperatively, resulting in better cycling retention and higher reversible capacity.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in situ and ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrated the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction is revealed to take place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron type nucleophilic substitution&#8208;triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeded under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional group compatibility. A mechanism involving aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Real&#8208;Space Visualization of Aromatic P3N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>A General Strategy Toward pH&#8208;Resistant Phenolic Fluorophores for High&#8208;Fidelity Sensing and Bioimaging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl alcohol&#8208;type or phenolic fluorophores offer diverse opportunities for developing bioimaging agents and fluorescence probes. Due to the inherently acidic hydroxyl functionality, phenolic fluorophores provide pH&#8208;dependent emission signals. Therefore, except for developing pH probes, the pH&#8208;dependent nature of phenolic fluorophores should be considered in bioimaging applications but has been neglected. Here we show that a simple structural remedy converts conventional phenolic fluorophores into pH&#8208;resistant derivatives, which also offer &#8220;medium&#8208;resistant&#8221; emission properties. The structural modification involves a single&#8208;step introduction of a hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor such as morpholine nearby the phenolic hydroxyl group, which also leads to emission bathochromic shift, increased Stokes shift, enhanced photo&#8208;stability and stronger emission for several dyes. The strategy greatly expands the current fluorophores&#8217; repertoire for reliable bioimaging applications, as demonstrated here with ratiometric imaging of cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting&#160; of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current&#160;Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density function theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO, compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which owns an excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190 mV and 385 mV at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000 mA cm&#8722;2) at 1.74 V and 1.80 V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000 h (@ 500 mA cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapidly synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis toward Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently faces mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;beared porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediates binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9% at 800 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to those in traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE high to 41.1% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878 nm in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. &#65279;Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35 mmol g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct selectivity control in solar&#8208;driven bio&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acid conversion: a comparison of Pt nanoparticles and atomically dispersed Pt on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic lignocellulose conversion is a promising strategy for the sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals, but selectivity control remains a challenging goal in this field. Here, we report efficient and selective conversion of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids to tartaric acid derivatives, &#945;&#8208;keto acids, and H2 using Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. Pt nanoparticles on CdS selectively produce tartaric acid derivatives via C&#8208;C coupling, while atomically dispersed Pt on CdS switches product selectivity to oxidation reaction to produce &#945;&#8208;keto acids. The atomically dispersed Pt species stabilized by Pt&#8208;S bonds promote the activation of hydroxyl group and thus switch product selectivity from tartaric acid derivatives to &#945;&#8208;keto acids. A broad range of lignocellulose&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl acids was applied for preparing the corresponding tartaric acid derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids over the two Pt&#8208;modified CdS catalysts. This work highlights the unique performance of metal sulfides in coupling reactions and demonstrates a strategy for rationally tuning product selectivity by engineering the interaction between metal sulfide and cocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Cu Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemcial Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper   nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8208;6 U/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457 Wh kg&#8208;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogenous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80%, and works steadily for 2000 h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000 mAh g&#8208;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogenous catalysts assembled in LOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8211;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8210;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Stacking and Aggregation Optimization of Photoactive Layer through Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer is a critical but challenging issue in developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Herein, two structurally similar analogues of anthra[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (ADT) and naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (NDT) are developed as solid additive to exploit their effect in regulating the molecular aggregation and &#960;&#8208;stacking of photoactive layer. We clarify that the perpendicular arrangements of NDT can enlarge the molecular packing space and improve the face&#8208;on stacking of Y6 during the film formation, favoring a more compact and ordered long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction after the removal of NDT under thermal annealing. The edge&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked herringbone&#8208;arrangement of ADT along with its non&#8208;volatilization under thermal annealing can induce the coexistence of face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on stacking of blend film. As a result, the NDT treatment shows encouraging effect in improving the photovoltaic performance of devices based on various systems. Particularly, a remarkable PCE of 18.85% is achieved in the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated by NDT additive, which is a significant improvement with regard to the PCE of 16.41% for the control device. This work offers a promising strategy to regulate the molecular packing and aggregation of photoactive layer towards significantly improved performance and stability of organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt; 99%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiment and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation.

Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition-metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D-incorporation (D-inc, up to &amp;gt; 99%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiment and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late-stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report    a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in oC), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key   *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8208; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980 nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4 h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Olefination with Organogermanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a fully orthogonal olefination, which involves the site&#8208; and E&#8208;selective coupling of aryl germanes with alkenes, tolerating otherwise widely employed coupling handles such as aromatic (pseudo)halogens (C&#8211;I, C&#8211;Br, C&#8211;Cl, C&#8211;F, C&#8211; OTf, C&#8211;OSO2F), silanes and boronic acid derivatives as well as alternative functionalities. This unprecedented [Ge]&#8208;based oxidative Heck coupling proceeds at room temperature with high speed (10 min to 2 hours) and operational simplicity owing to its base&#8208;free and air&#8208;tolerant features.</dc:description>
