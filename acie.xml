         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8211;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF&#8208;polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8211;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.</dc:description>

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Induced Electrical and Magnetic Modulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900 nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900 nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering sp&#8208;Carbon Content in Graphdiynes for Enhanced Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to sp2&#8208;hybridized graphene, graphdiynes (GDYs) composed of sp and sp2 carbon are highly promising as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction into oxygen peroxide because of the high catalytic reactivity of the electron&#8208;rich sp&#8208;carbon atoms. The desired catalytic capacity of GDY, such as catalytic selectivity and efficiency, can theoretically be achieved by strategically steering the sp&#8208;carbon contents or the topological arrangement of the acetylenic linkages and aromatic bonds. Herein, we successfully tuned the electrocatalytic activity of GDYs by regulating the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratios with different organic monomer precursors. As the active sp&#8208;carbon atoms possess electron&#8208;sufficient &#960; orbitals, they can donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of O2 molecules and initiate subsequent O2 reduction, GDY with the high sp&#8208;carbon content of 50 at% exhibits excellent capability of catalyzing O2 reduction into H2O2. It demonstrates exceptional H2O2 selectivity of over 95.0% and impressive performance in practical H2O2 production, Faraday efficiency (FE) exceeding 99.0%, and a yield of 83.3 nmol s&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2. Our work holds significant importance in effectively steering the inherent properties of GDYs by purposefully adjusting the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratio and highlights their immense potential for research and applications in catalysis and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;Bottlebrush Networks: A Primer for Advanced Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This perspective aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.</dc:description>

         <title>CO intermediate&#8208;assisted dynamic Cu sintering during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8208;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Nanometer&#8208;Sized Pt Catalysts with an Additional Photothermy Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the  mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these 'spin gates' occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8208;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371 F g&#8208;1, which is 38% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27 nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0 m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8208; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37 mmol&#65381;g&#8208;1&#65381;h&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in&#8208;situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IIdentifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competition Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method's speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2T x  MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in&#8208;situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T = CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15 &#181;m and high productivity (over 70%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2TxMXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Mesoporosity in Type III Porous Liquids through Dual&#8208;layer Surface Weaving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers,&#160;ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization&#160;of PS&#160;(denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes&#160;over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2 wt% of virgin PS at 280 oC for 6 h&#160;with&#160;the production rate of 118.1 mmolcarbon&#160;gcatal.&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3 wt% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies,&#160;methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates&#160;by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations via intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are also elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive&#160;and Robust&#160;Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8211;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8722;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8210;ester networks.&#160;Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transfer Dehydrogenation Method Enables a Family of High Crystalline Benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a transfer dehydrogenation method to prepare a novel series of imidazole&#8208;linked phthalocyanine Cu (II)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) films and powders. The high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs films that possess intrinsic conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m) were fabricated into synaptic devices, which have small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) and response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared.







Abstract
Heterocycle&#8208;linked phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with close&#8208;packed &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structures are a kind of material with intrinsic electrical conductivity, and they are considered to be candidates for photoelectrical devices. Previous studies have revealed their applications for energy storage, gas sensors, and field&#8208;effect transistors. However, their potential application in photodetector is still not fully studied. The main difficulty is preparing high&#8208;quality films. In our study, we found that our newly designed benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) film can hardly formed with a regular aerobic oxidation method. Therefore, we developed a transfer dehydrogenation method with N&#8208;benzylideneaniline (BA) as a mild reagent. With this in hand, we successfully prepared a family of high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs powders and films. Furthermore, both of these new BICuPc&#8208;COFs films showed high electrical conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m), higher than most of the reported COFs materials. Due to the broad absorption and high conductivity of BICuPc&#8208;COFs, synaptic devices with small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) were fabricated with response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared. Based on these findings, we expect this study will provide a new perspective for the application of conducting heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs in synaptic devices.

         <title>Molecule and Microstructure Modulations of Cyano&#8208;Containing Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Fully Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule and microstructure modulations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes craft a groundbreaking CNT@PFDCB with core&#8211;shell heterostructure, which breaks through the limitations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes including inevitable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. As a result, the novel CNT@PFDCB achieves high capacity, elevated voltage, superior rate ability, and exceptional cycling stability, standing out among the reported organic cathodes.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8211;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4&#8208;dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8211;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate ability (127.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Additionally, the Li&#8208;storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well&#8208;validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.

&lt;p&gt;Molecule and microstructure modulations of cyano-containing electrodes craft a groundbreaking CNT@PFDCB with core&#8211;shell heterostructure, which breaks through the limitations of cyano-containing electrodes including inevitable self-dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. As a result, the novel CNT@PFDCB achieves high capacity, elevated voltage, superior rate ability, and exceptional cycling stability, standing out among the reported organic cathodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyano-containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self-dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8211;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4-dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8211;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), remarkable rate ability (127.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, the Li-storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well-validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper Nanodrugs by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several copper (Cu) complexes with anticancer activity were employed as catalysts for miniemulsion atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in aqueous medium, producing Cu&#8208;loaded nanodrugs with simple steps and precise physiochemical property. The product showed prolonged blood circulation&#160;and&#160;improved&#160;tumor accumulation,&#160;with&#160;superior anticancer efficacy compared&#160;to cisplatin, showing great potential for clinical transition.







Abstract
In this study, some copper catalysts used for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were explored as efficient anti&#8208;tumor agents. The aqueous solution of copper&#8208;containing nanoparticles with uniform spheric morphology was in situ prepared through a copper&#8208;catalyzed activator generated by electron transfer (AGET) ATRP in water. Nanoparticles were then directly injected into tumor&#8208;bearing mice for antitumor chemotherapy. The copper nanodrugs had prolonged blood circulation time and enhanced accumulation at tumor sites, thus showing potent antitumor activity. This work provides a novel strategy for precise and large&#8208;scale preparation of copper nanodrugs with high antitumor activity.

         <title>Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock: A Rebuilding&#8208;free Electrochemical Chip with a Customizable Decoding Probe for Real&#8208;Time and Portable Pathogen Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) and a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use multichannel instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T) for portable isothermal amplification detection. Our method provides high sensitivity &amp; selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background, one&#8208;pot operation and real&#8208;time signal collection.







Abstract
In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branched DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T), the detection can be implemented on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, FluA and FluB) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.

         <title>Abiotic Methane Production Driven by Ubiquitous Non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Type Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidate a ubiquitous yet previously unappreciated source of abiotic CH4 production via non&#8208;Fenton chemistry reactions, which not only substantially broadens CH4 production in complex natural environments, but also offers an innovative, simple and sustainable approach for engineering CH4 production as a high&#8208;value energy resources.







Abstract
Abiotic CH4 production driven by Fenton&#8208;type reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been confirmed to be an indispensable component of the atmospheric CH4 budget. While the chemical reactions independent of Fenton chemistry to ROS are ubiquitous in nature, it remains unknown whether the produced ROS can drive abiotic CH4 production. Here, we first demonstrated the abiotic CH4 production at the soil&#8208;water interface under illumination. Leveraging this finding, polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) as a typical analogue of natural geobattery material and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a natural methyl donor were used to unravel the underlying mechanisms. We revealed that the ROS, photocatalytically produced by CNx, can oxidize DMSO into CH4 with a high selectivity of 91.5&#8201;%. Such an abiotic CH4 production process was further expanded to various non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type reaction systems, such as electrocatalysis, pyrocatalysis and sonocatalysis. This work provides insights into the geochemical cycle of abiotic CH4, and offers a new route to CH4 production via integrated energy development.

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that a special loop structure of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 incorporated into the network enables substantial energy dissipation and exceptional elasticity, significantly enhancing mechanical performance, while the recognition of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and guest molecules, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts, significantly enhances the recovery performance of the material.







Abstract
Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a universal design principle and synthetic shortcut towards HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and can be used in multifunctional optoelectronic devices. This work opens a new avenue for developing HAME&#8208;CPs by efficient synthesis and rational design.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers (HAME-CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade-off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid-state luminescence, the development of HAME-CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME-CPs are developed.

         <title>Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic ammonium molecule 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenyl quinuclidinium and a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with excellent alkaline stability were successfully developed. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based (PGM&#8208;free) anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) with PAQ&#8208;5 achieved the highest current density (8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 2&#8197;V and the longest durability among all PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WEs reported so far.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange capacity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x was verified and retained in the ex situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and excellent stability over 2446&#8197;h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.

         <title>Rocking&#8208;Chair Aqueous Fluoride&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous fluoride ion battery with the development of electrolytes with KOAc&#8208;KF binary salts is constructed, which exhibits concurrent fluorination or defluorination reactions occurring at both cathode and anode electrodes. Weakening of the F&#8722;&#8722;H2O hydrogen bonding by OAc&#8722; anion in the electrolyte is responsible for the optimized electrochemical process.







Abstract
Aqueous fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered attention for their high theoretical energy density, yet they are challenged by sluggish fluorination kinetics, active material dissolution, and electrolyte instability. Here, we present a room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous FIBs featuring KOAc&#8208;KF binary salt electrolytes, enabling concurrent fluorination and defluorination reactions at both cathode and anode electrodes. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that acetate ions in the electrolyte compete with fluoride ions in hydrogen bonding formation, weakening the excessively strong solvation between H2O and F&#8722; ions. This results in the suppression of detrimental HF formation and a reduced desolvation energy of F&#8722; ions, enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The bismuth&#8208;based cathode exhibits direct conversion in the optimized electrolyte, effectively suppressing the detrimental disproportionation reactions from Bi2+ intermediates. Additionally, zinc anode undergoes a typical fluorination process, forming solid KZnF3 as the electrode product, minimizing the risks of hydrogen evolution. The proposed aqueous FIBs with the optimized electrolyte demonstrate high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capabilities.

         <title>Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 over CeO2 with Electron&#8208;Enriched Lattice Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron enriched lattice oxygen species provided abundant base sites for CO2 adsorption and simultaneously facilitated the weakly absorbed methoxy formation, thus shifting the rate determining&#8208;step from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation and lowering the energy barrier of dimethyl carbonate synthesis.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 plays an important role in carbon neutrality, but its efficiency is still far from the practical application, due to the limited understanding of the reaction mechanism and rational design of efficient catalyst. Herein, abundant electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen species were introduced into CeO2 catalyst by constructing the point defects and crystal&#8208;terminated phases in the crystal reconstruction process. Benefitting from the acid&#8208;base properties modulated by the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, the optimized CeO2 catalyst exhibited a much higher DMC yield of 22.2 mmol g&#8208;1 than the reported metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalysts at the similar conditions. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can provide abundant sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, and was advantageous of the formation of the weakly adsorbed active methoxy species. These were facilitating to the coupling of methoxy and CO2 for the key *CH3OCOO intermediate formation. More importantly, the weakened adsorption of *CH3OCOO on the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can switch the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS) of DMC synthesis from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation, and lower the corresponding activation barriers, thus giving rise to a high performance. This work provides insights into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol and the design of highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;Emissive Schiff Bases Into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy to turn non&#8208;emissive Schiff bases into aggregate emitters has been realized. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.







Abstract
Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular diffusion through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.

Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid-state molecular diffusion through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming of Supercrystals Using Replicable DNA&#8208;Functionalized Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner by integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem for producing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies.







Abstract
The development of self&#8208;replicating systems is of great importance in research on the origin of life. As the most iconic molecules, nucleic acids have provided prominent examples of the fabrication of self&#8208;replicating artificial nanostructures. However, it is still challenging to construct sophisticated synthetic systems that can create large&#8208;scale or three&#8208;dimensionally ordered nanomaterials using self&#8208;replicating nanostructures. By integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem to produce DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies, we developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner. The replication efficiency and crystal quality of the resulting superlattice structures can be effectively increased by regulating the molar ratio of the template to the copy colloids. By constructing binary systems from two types of gold nanoparticles (or proteins), superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained through the replication and catalytic assembly processes. This programmable enthalpy&#8208;mediated approach was easily leveraged to achieve the phase transformation and catalytic amplification of colloidal crystals starting from different initial template crystals. This work offers a potential way to construct self&#8208;replicating artificial systems that exhibit complicated phase behaviors and can produce large&#8208;scale superlattice nanomaterials.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond&#8208;Forming for the Synthesis of Skipped Dienes with Synergistic Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic catalytic strategy has addressed the great challenge in Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond coupling. A variety of structurally diverse skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes are furnished in synthetically useful yields and good enantioselectivity. This strategy has also been applied for the total synthesis of the analogues of (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D.







Abstract
Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions represent a great challenge in homogeneous catalysis primarily due to a limited understanding of its mechanistic principles. Herein, we have developed an interesting catalytic strategy that leverages a synergistic combination of a dimeric manganese(I) catalyst and a chiral aminocatalyst to address this issue. A range of conjugated dienals and trienals can exclusively proceed 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation by using readily available aromatic and aliphatic alkenyl boronic acids as coupling partners, producing a rich library of skipped diene aldehydes in synthetically useful yields and high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, downstream transformations of these products can not only afford a concise approach to construct enantioenriched skipped trienes but also realize enantioselective total synthesis of analogues to (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D in four steps. DFT calculations suggest the 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation is kinetically more favorable than 1,6&#8208;hydroalkenylation.

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Fluoroalkylation through Ligand Coupling Reaction of Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes are efficiently synthesized from fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones via Grignard reagent&#8208;promoted formal SO2 extrusion reaction. The reaction proceeds through the ligand coupling of a pentacoordinate sulfur(VI) intermediate and exhibits unique fluorine effect.







Abstract
Ligand coupling on hypervalent main group elements has emerged as a pivotal methodology for the synthesis of functionalized N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds in recent years due to the avoidance of transition metals and the mildness of the reaction conditions. In this direction, the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfur(IV) and N&#8208;heteroaryl phosphorus(V) compounds has been well studied. However, the ligand coupling of sulfur(VI) is still underdeveloped and the reaction of alkyl N&#8208;heteroarylsulfones is still elusive, which does not match the high status of sulfones as the chemical chameleons in organic synthesis. Here we present a ligand coupling&#8208;enabled formal SO2 extrusion of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones under the promotion of Grignard reagents, which not only enriches the chemistry of sulfones, but also provides a novel and practical synthetic tool towards N&#8208;heteroaromatic fluoroalkylation.

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropically driven self&#8208;assembled system based on a platinum complex displays a dual enhancement of phosphorescence and chiroptical response, both in the ground state and excited state (glum value increases from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06), upon elevating the temperature of the supramolecular system. The strategy developed in this work overcomes the customary trade&#8208;off between QY and glum, a prevalent challenge in most CPL materials.







Abstract
Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8722;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8722;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15&#8201;% at 25&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10&#8197;cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8722;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8722;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69&#8201;% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo&#8208;enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>How to Deal with Charge in the Ranking of Lewis Acidity: Critical Evaluation of an Extensive Set of Cationic Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge of a compound strongly influences the affinity towards anionic donors. Accordingly, comparing vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) for Lewis acids of varying charge states is of limited use. Here, the systematic evaluation of the FIA of &gt;700 literature&#8208;known cationic Lewis acids suggests how to tackle this charge problem and explores the influence of counteranions.







Abstract
The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge&#8208;caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation&#8208;induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase.

     alt="How to Deal with Charge in the Ranking of Lewis Acidity: Critical Evaluation of an Extensive Set of Cationic Lewis Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge of a compound strongly influences the affinity towards anionic donors. Accordingly, comparing vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) for Lewis acids of varying charge states is of limited use. Here, the systematic evaluation of the FIA of &amp;gt;700 literature-known cationic Lewis acids suggests how to tackle this charge problem and explores the influence of counteranions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono-, di- and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge-caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation-corrected FIA&lt;sub&gt;solv&lt;/sub&gt; is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation-induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase. Exploring alternative scales, explicit counteranion effects, and selected experimental case studies reaffirms the advantages of solvation-corrected FIA&lt;sub&gt;solv&lt;/sub&gt; as the most versatile and practical approach for the quantitative ranking of general (thermodynamic) Lewis acidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the ROP of bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), yielding chemically recyclable nylon with high molecular weight (up to 75.7&#8197;kDa) and impressive thermostability (up to 283&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, the 5/6&#8208;LM can be scaled to 50&#8197;g per batch in the lab, with the efficient recycling of the Pd/C catalyst and methanol over 8 cycles, highlighting the process&#8216;s efficiency and promising scalability for future applications.







Abstract
Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95&#8201;% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50&#8197;g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#8201;&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic hydroarylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) and Dha&#8208;containing peptides with versatile arylthianthrenium salts was developed in batch and in flow, enabling expedient scale&#8208;up. The mild nature of the photocatalytic approach allowed the diversification of peptides featuring various sensitive functional groups and the effective stitching of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a myriad of arenes and drug scaffolds.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis by the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;Yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry, the energy&#8208;rich and reductive carborane subunits were covalently incorporated into the pores of energetic frameworks. This innovative decoration approach enables integrate multiple functionalities, ultimately achieving enhanced energy density, improved safety and shortened ignition delay time of the energetic frameworks.







Abstract
Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8722;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2, via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6&#8201;% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4&#8197;ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8722;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.

         <dc:description>We here report a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was driven by photo and involved 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were achieved in one operational step. This protocol also provided a modular tool for constructing dienes via &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy from the three components of amines, pyrazol and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach in sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating photophysical properties of TABs in red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, endowing a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display distinct red&#8208;shift in absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and enhancing charge transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective defluorination of trifluoromethyl substituents by conformationally induced remote substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective reduction of an aromatic trifluoromethyl substituent to a difluoromethyl substituent may be achieved by base&#8208;promoted elimination to form a difluoro&#8208;p&#8208;quinomethide which is trapped by an intramolecular nucleophile. High yields are obtained when the nucleophilic trap entails the conformationally favoured cyclisation of an aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) derivative. The resulting cyclised difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted arylimidazolidinone products are readily converted to versatile difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes by reduction and hydrolysis. Defluorination is successful on a range of benzenoid (both para and ortho CF3 substituted) and heterocyclic substrates. Double defluorination may likewise be achieved sequentially, or in a single step from an Aib dipeptide derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutyl Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R = Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutyl rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5% = 376&#8722;380 &#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8208;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, it&#8217;s asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8211;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with internal alkynes. A broad range of N&#8211;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Hetero&#8208;Phase Nanostructure via a Secondary Building Unit (SBU) Regulating Strategy for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having high ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. Using this strategy, a cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (tT = 62 &#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916; = 54.3%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC) = &#8208;1.93 eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC) = &#8208;0.84 eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83% conversion of 1 mM monomer in 30 s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10 mW cm&#8208;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt; 50 mM). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10 &#956;m.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Pyroelectric Property Accompanied by Spin Crossover in a Single Crystal of Fe(II)&#160;Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroelectric materials hold significant potential for energy harvesting, sensing, and imaging applications. However, achieving high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a wide temperature range near room temperature&#160;remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a single crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover compound shows remarkable pyroelectric properties accompanied by a thermally controlled spin transition. In this material, the uniaxial alignment of polar molecules results in a polarization of the lattice. As the molecular geometry is modulated during a gradual spin transition, the polar axis experiences a colossal thermal expansion with a coefficient of 796 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1. Consequently, the material&#8217;s polarization undergoes significant modulation as a secondary pyroelectric effect. The considerable shift in polarization (pyroelectric coefficient,&#160;p = 3.7~22 nC K&#8722;1cm&#8722;2), coupled with a low dielectric constant (&#949;' = 4.4~5.4) over a remarkably wide temperature range of 298 to 400 K, suggests this material is a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric. The demonstration of pyroelectricity combined with magnetic switching in this study will inspire further investigations in the field of molecular electronics and magnetism.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando&#160;Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8208;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8208;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8208;Co&#8208;Co&#8208;S moieties as the true catalytic active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8208;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8208;S&#8208;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8208;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into the Terpene Cyclization Domains of Two Fungal Sesterterpene Synthases and Enzymatic Engineering for Sesterterpene Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Little is known about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of sesterterpene synthases (StTSs), which greatly hinders the structure&#8208;based engineering of StTSs for structural diversity expansion of sesterterpenes. We here report on the crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal StTSs: sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) and sesterbrasiliatriene synthase (PbSS). Both TC structures contain benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTAC), pyrophosphate (PPi), and magnesium ions (Mg2+), clearly defining the catalytic active sites. A combination of theory and experiments including carbocationic intermediates modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into the structural basis for their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.</dc:description>

Structure-based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Design of Highly Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymer for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly stable porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with integrated electrical conductivity is crucial for advancing our understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms and the structure&#8208;activity relationship of electrocatalysts. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge because of the electrochemical instability observed in most PCPs. Herein, we develop a &#8220;modular design&#8221; strategy to construct electrochemically stable semiconducting PCP, namely, Fe&#8208;pyNDI, which incorporates a chain&#8208;type Fe&#8208;pyrazole metal cluster and &#960;&#8208;stacking column with effective synergistic effects. The three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) technique resolves the precise structure. Both theoretical and experimental investigation confirms that the &#960;&#8208;stacking column in Fe&#8208;pyNDI can provide an efficient electron transport path and enhance the structural stability of the material. As a result, Fe&#8208;pyNDI can serve as an efficient model electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia with a superior ammonia yield of 339.2 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 (14677 &#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a faradaic efficiency of 87 % at neutral electrolyte, which is comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that during the reaction, the structure of Fe&#8208;pyNDI can be kept, while part of the Fe3+ in Fe&#8208;pyNDI was reduced in situ to Fe2+, which serves as the potential active species for NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Polaritonic Chemistry by 

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polaritonic chemistry is emerging as a powerful approach to modifying the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials. However, probing how the electronics and dynamics of molecular systems change under strong coupling has been challenging due to the narrow range of spectroscopic techniques that can be applied in situ. Here we develop microfluidic optical cavities for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that are compatible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using standard liquid NMR tubes. VSC is shown to influence the equilibrium between two conformations of a molecular balance sensitive to London dispersion forces, revealing an apparent change in the equilibrium constant under VSC. In all compounds studied, VSC does not induce detectable changes in chemical shifts, J&#8208;couplings, or spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times. This unexpected finding indicates that VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions, and in turn has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry under VSC and suggests that the emergence of collective behavior is critical.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus lipid A with a unique tetrasaccharide backbone and evaluation of its&#160;immunological functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid A. Acetobacter pasteurianus is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on A. pasteurianus lipid A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of A. pasteurianus lipid A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of A. pasteurianus lipid As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2&#8208;trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of A. pasteurianus lipid As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of A. pasteurianus LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of A. pasteurianus lipid A contributes to its high chemical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Interlayer Spacings as Perfectly Selective Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological proton channels have perfect selectivity in aqueous environment against almost all ions and molecules, a property that differs itself from other biological channels and a feature that remains challenging to realize for bulk artificial materials. The biological perfect selectivity originates from the fact that the channel has almost no free space for ion or water transport but generates a hydrogen bonded wire in the presence of protons to allow the proton hopping. Inspired by this, we used the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups as perfectly selective artificial proton channels. The interlayer spacings are so narrow that no atoms or molecules can diffuse through. However, protons exhibit a diffusivity in the same order of magnitude as that in bulk water. Density functional theory calculations show that water molecules and the COF material form hydrogen bonded wires, allowing the proton hopping. We further demonstrate that the proton transport rate can be tuned by adjusting the acidity of the functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Palmarumycin Spirobisnaphthalene&#160;Biosynthesis Reveals a Set of Previously Unrecognized Oxidases and Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spirobisnaphthalenes (SBNs) are a class of highly oxygenated, fungal bisnaphthalenes containing an unique spiroketal bridge, that displayed diverse bioactivities. Among the reported SBNs, palmarumycins are the major type, which are precursors for the other type of SBNs structurally. However, the biosynthesis of SBNs is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthesis of palmarumycins, using gene disruption, heterologous expression, and substrate feeding experiments. The biosynthetic gene cluster for palmarumycins was identified to be distant from the polyketide synthase gene cluster, and included two cytochrome P450s (PalA and PalB), and one short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PalC) encoding genes as key structural genes. PalA is an unusual, multifunctional P450 that catalyzes the oxidative dimerization of 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to generate the spiroketal linkage and 2,3&#8208;epoxy group. Chemical synthesis of key intermediate and in vitro biochemical assays proved that the oxidative dimerization proceeded via a binaphthyl ether. PalB installs the C&#8208;5 hydroxyl group, widely found in SBNs. PalC catalyzes 1&#8208;keto reduction, the reverse 1&#8208;dehydrogenation, and 2,3&#8208;epoxide reduction. Moreover, an FAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, encoded by palD, which locates outside the cluster, functions as 1&#8208;dehydrogenase. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical evidence&#160;for the biosynthesis of palmarumycin SBNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Titanium on Mesoporous Nitrogen, Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Photo&#8208;thermal Catalytic CO2 Cycloaddition by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for CO2 fixation to high value&#8208;added chemicals is meaningful but challenging. Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value&#8208;added process, we introduce earth&#8208;abundant Ti single&#8208;atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Ti&#8208;CNO) by a two&#8208;step method. The Ti&#8208;CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti&#8208;CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3%, much higher than CN (27.1%). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide&#8226;+ and CO2&#8226;&#8208; radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Ti&#948;+) and basic sites of Ti&#8208;CNO under light irradiation, respectively. This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for photo&#8208;thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.</dc:description>

This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single-atom catalysts for photo-thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Catalysts&#160;Enabling Efficient C&#8208;N Coupling toward the Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a methodology for synthesizing value&#8208;added urea (CO(NH2)2) via a renewable electricity&#8208;driven C&#8208;N coupling reaction under mild conditions is highly anticipated. However, the complex catalytic active sites that act on the carbon and nitrogen species make the reaction mechanism unclear, resulting in a low efficiency of C&#8208;N coupling from the co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8208;). Herein,we propose a novel tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co), in which the Mo sites serve to facilitate nitrate reduction to the *NH2 intermediate, while the Co sites enhance CO2 reduction to carbonic oxide (CO), thus synergistically promoting C&#8208;N coupling. The synthesized Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) catalyst exhibited a noteworthy urea yield rate of 844.11mg h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, alongside a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 33.90% at &#8722;0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By combining in situ spectroscopic techniques with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that efficient C&#8208;N coupling is attributed to a tandem system in which the *NH2 and *CO intermediates produced by the Mo and Co active sites of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) stabilize the formation of the *CONH2 intermediate. This study provides an effective avenue for the design and synthesis of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Formation of Silver Nanoclusters and Their Transformation to the Same Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, two atomically precise silver nanoclusters, Ag54 and Ag33, directed by inner anion templates (CrO42&#8208; and/or Cl&#8208;), are initially isolated as a mixed phase from identical reactants across a wide temperature range (20&#8208;80 &#176;C). Interestingly, fine&#8208;tuning the reaction temperature can realize  pure phase synthesis of the two nanoclusters; that is, a metastable Ag54 is kinetically formed at a low temperature (20 &#176;C), whereas such a system is steered towards a thermodynamically stable Ag33 at a relatively high temperature (80 &#176;C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry illustrates that the stability of Ag33 is superior to that of Ag54, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the difference in structural stability can influence the pathway of 1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene induced transformation reaction starting from Ag54 and Ag33. The former undergoes a dramatic breakage&#8208;reorganization process to form an Ag31 dimer (Ag31), while the same product can be also achieved from the latter following a noninvasive ligand exchange process. Both the Ag54 and Ag33 have the potential for further remote laser ignition applications. This work not only demonstrates how temperature controls the isolation of a specific phase, but also sheds light on the structural transformation pathway of nanoclusters with different stability.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Butadiene Purification in a Sulfonate&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Synergistic Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials that could recognize specific molecules from complex mixtures are of great potential in improving the current energy&#8208;intensive multistep separation processes. However, due to the highly similar structures and properties of the mixtures, the design of desired porous materials remains challenging. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 with suitable pore size and pore chemistry is designed for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) purification from complex C4 mixtures. The sulfonate anions decorated in the channel achieve selective recognition of C4H6 from other C4 olefins with subtle polarity differences through C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8208;S interactions, affording recorded C4H6/trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 selectivity (4.4). Meanwhile, the shrunken mouth of the channel with a suitable pore size (4.6 &#197;) exhibits exclusion effect to the larger molecules cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8, iso&#8208;C4H8, n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10. Benefiting from the moderate C4 olefins binding affinity exhibited by sulfonate anions, the adsorbed C4H6 could be easily regenerated near ambient conditions. Polymer&#8208;grade 1,3&#8208;butadiene (99.5%) is firstly obtained from 7&#8208;component C4 mixtures via one adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. The work demonstrates the great potential of synergistic recognition of size&#8208;sieving and thermodynamically equilibrium in dealing with complex mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile's Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetonitrile electrolyte additive is found to delay hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). It also suppresses vanadium (V) dissolution, or V&#8208;ion crosstalk, from the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) cathode. Practically, acetonitrile&#8208;added electrolyte enabled a high and stable areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using a 26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 V2O5 dry&#8208;film cathode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte constituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN&#8208;modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water achieves a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited 63&#8197;times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;initiation voltage from 2&#8594;2.44&#8197;V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55&#8197;V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated an AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study shed light on the strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.

         <title>6&#8208;Strand to Stable 10/12 Helix Conformational Switch by Incorporating Flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly in the Homooligomers of Camphor Derived &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: NMR and X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Evidence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks (CDA) derived from naturally occuring camphor are introduced as new design tools to construct diverse secondary structures. Specifically, the conformational switching to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix, by simply inserting flexible achiral &#946;&#8208;hGly spacers in a 6&#8208;strand stabilizing CDA&#8208;homooligomers, exemplifies the potential of the CDAs in backbone regulation and in developing functional foldamers.







Abstract
Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks: [1S,2R,4R]exoCDA and [1S,2S,4R]endoCDA, derived from the abundantly available R(+)&#8208;camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value.

     alt="6-Strand to Stable 10/12 Helix Conformational Switch by Incorporating Flexible &#946;-hGly in the Homooligomers of Camphor Derived &#946;-Amino Acid: NMR and X-Ray Crystallographic Evidence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acid building blocks (CDA) derived from naturally occuring camphor are introduced as new design tools to construct diverse secondary structures. Specifically, the conformational switching to a robust 10/12-helix, by simply inserting flexible achiral &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly spacers in a 6-strand stabilizing CDA-homooligomers, exemplifies the potential of the CDAs in backbone regulation and in developing functional foldamers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acid building blocks: [1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA and [1&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;CDA, derived from the abundantly available &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(+)-camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value. Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA adopt 6-strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12-helix simply by inserting flexible &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly spacer at alternate positions (1&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly/&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT-calculations, solution-state NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline-state structure of left-handed 10/12-mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; substitutions, to access the 10/12-helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA don&#8242;t adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana-shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;CDA, nucleate 8-membered turns. Furthermore, the homo-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA and hetero-[&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self-association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side-chain substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;ion Anchor Induced Highly Reversible Zn Anodes for High Performance Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable Zn interface with serious detrimental parasitic side&#8208;reactions and uncontrollable Zn dendrites severely plagues the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The interface stability was closely related to the electrolyte configuration and Zn2+ depositional behavior. In this work, a unique Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8208;NR4+ groups.&#160;While the negatively charged &#8208;SO3&#8208; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side&#8208;reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000 hours long lifespan (0.25 mAh cm&#8208;2, 0.25 mAh cm&#8208;2). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH4V4O10llZn pouch&#8208;cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4% capacity retention for 180 cycles. A more practical 4 cm*4 cm sized pouch&#8208;cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0 mAh over 50 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expanded Palette of Fluorescent COS/H2S&#8208;Releasing Donors for H2S Delivery, Detection, and In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H2S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H2S donors have been developed to deliver H2S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H2S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H2S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol&#8208;activated fluorescence turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared&#8208;emitting dyes functionalized with an H2S&#8208;releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response (3&#8211;310&#8208;fold) and high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;60%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H2S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H2S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H2S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H2S release from a fluorogenic donor in non&#8208;transparent organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal Surfaces&#160;for Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26 &#215; 1014 cm&#8208;2. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H2O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Implanting colloidal nanoparticles into single&#8208;crystalline zeolites&#160;for Catalytic Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The encapsulation of functional colloidal nanoparticles (100 nm) into single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites, aiming to create uniform core&#8208;shell structures, is a highly sought&#8208;after yet formidable objective due to significant lattice mismatch and distinct crystallization properties. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a core&#8208;shell structured single&#8208;crystal zeolite encompassing an Fe3O4 colloidal core via a novel confinementstepwise crystallization methodology. By engineering a confined nanocavity, anchoring nucleation sites, and executing stepwise crystallization, we have successfully encapsulated colloidal nanoparticles (CN) within single&#8208;crystal zeolites. These grafted sites, alongside the controlled crystallization process, compel the zeolite seed to nucleate and expand along the Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticle surface, within a meticulously defined volume (1.5 &#215; 107 &#8804; V &#8804; 1.3 &#215; 108 nm3). Our strategy exhibits versatility and adaptability to an array of zeolites, including but not restricted to ZSM&#8208;5, NaA, ZSM&#8208;11, and TS&#8208;1 with polycrystalline zeolite shell. We highlight the uniformly structured magnetic&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;crystalline zeolite, which displays pronounced superparamagnetism (14 emu/g) and robust acidity (~0.83 mmol/g). This innovative material has been effectively utilized in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor for the dehydration of ethanol, delivering an exceptional conversion rate (98%), supreme ethylene selectivity (98%), and superior catalytic endurance (in excess of 100 hours).</dc:description>

         <title>Light Induced Proton Coupled Charge Transfer Triggers Counterion Directional Translocation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4&#8208; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym&#8208;OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited&#8208;state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4- anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym-OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) and charge-transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited-state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion.

         <title>Layer&#8208;Controllable &#8220;2.5D&#8221; DNA Origami Crystals Synthesized by a Hierarchical Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The finite periodic arrangement of functional nanomaterials on the two&#8208;dimensional scale enables the integration and enhancement of individual properties, making them an important research topic in the field of tuneable nanodevices. Although layer&#8208;controllable lattices such as graphene have been successfully synthesized, achieving similar control over colloidal nanoparticles remains a challenge. DNA origami technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in programmed nanoparticle assembly. Based on this technology, we proposed a hierarchical assembly strategy to construct a universal DNA origami platform with customized layer properties, which we called 2.5&#8208;dimensional (2.5D) DNA origami crystals. Methodologically, this strategy divides the assembly procedure into two steps: 1) array synthesis, and 2) lattice synthesis, which means that the layer properties, including layer number, interlayer distance, and surface morphology, can be flexibly customized based on the independent designs in each step. In practice, these synthesized 2.5D crystals not only pioneer the expansion of the DNA origami crystal library to a wider range of dimensions, but also highlight the technological potential for templating 2.5D colloidal nanomaterial lattices.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Silica&#8208;Coated Fluorescent Microspheres (MagSiGlow) for Simultaneous Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplexed bead assays for solution&#8208;phase biosensing often encounter cross&#8208;over reactions during signal amplification, leading to false positives and high background signals. Current solutions involve complex, custom&#8208;designed equipment or costly setups, limiting their application in simple laboratory environments. In this study, we introduce a straightforward protocol to adapt a multiplexed single&#8208;bead assay to standard fluorescence imaging plates, enabling the simultaneous analysis of thousands of reactions per plate. Our approach focuses on the design and synthesis of bright fluorescent and magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) with multiple fluorescent wavelengths serving as detection markers. This imaging&#8208;based single&#8208;bead assay, combined with a scripted algorithm, allows the detection, segmentation, and co&#8208;localization on average of 7500 microspheres per field of view across five imaging channels in less than one second. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with remarkable sensitivity (detection limits of 100 pg/mL). This technique showed over 85% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over to the solution&#8208;based approaches after the concurrent detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers. This approach promises to significantly advance high throughput biosensing in diverse laboratory settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Tertiary Amines: Introducing Secondary Amines via Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Ortho Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE)&#8208;catalyzed ortho amination in 2013, escaping the limitation of only yielding tertiary anilines has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in the past decade. Here, we describe that, by carefully choosing the phosphine ligand and NBE mediator, installation of a N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylamino group becomes feasible. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aryl iodide substrates and various N&#8208;mono&#8208;tertiary alkylamine&#8208;derived electrophiles. Both ipso alkenylation and alkynylation can be realized. The synthetic utility of this method is exemplified in the formation of primary amino group via selective deprotection and streamlined access to N&#8208;heterocycles. Preliminary success of installing a bulky N&#8208;secondary alkylamino group and mechanistic understanding of the decomposition pathways of mono N&#8208;alkylamine electrophiles have been obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; Driven Dimensional Polymorphism in Supramolecular Polymers for the Photocatalytic Oxidation and Separation of Aromatic/Cyclic Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise assembly of molecular building blocks is essential for designing polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs). A self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motif has been developed to steer the self&#8208;assembly directionality of monomers to facilitate the creation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline supramolecular structures. These polymorphic SAs will have applications in various fields.







Abstract
The phenomenon of polymorphism is ubiquitous in nature, the controlled manipulation of which not only increases our ontological understanding of nature but also facilitates the conceptualization and realization of novel functional materials. However, achieving targeted polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs) remains a formidable challenge, largely because of the constraints inherent in controlling the specific binding motifs of noncovalent interactions. Herein, we propose self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs to construct polymorphic SAs in both the solid and solution states. Using distinct discrete cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation and long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs enables control of the self&#8208;assembly directionality of a C2h&#8208;symmetric bifunctional monomer, resulting in the successful formation of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional crystalline SAs (2D&#8208;CSA and 3D&#8208;CSA). The differences in the molecular packing of 3D&#8208;CSA compared with that of 2D&#8208;CSA significantly improve the charge separation and carrier mobility, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide (yield of 99&#8201;% vs 57&#8201;%). 2D&#8208;CSA, which has a vertical extended structure with favorable stronger interaction with toluene though face&#8208;to&#8208;face cation&#8208;&#960; interactions than methylcyclohexane, shows higher toluene/methylcyclohexane separation efficiency than 3D&#8208;CSA (96.9&#8201;% for 2D&#8208;CSA vs 56.3&#8201;% for 3D&#8208;CSA).

         <title>Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Direct Oxidation of Methane under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis technique for converting methane to formaldehyde and methanol under ambient conditions, using electrified fluorinated ethylene propylene with water. Achieving high yield of HCHO, this method significantly advances the field of catalysis by efficiently activating methane with reactive oxygen.







Abstract
The conversion of methane under ambient conditions has attracted significant attention. Although advancements have been made using active oxygen species from photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical processes, challenges such as complex catalyst design, costly oxidants, and unwanted byproducts remain. This study exploits the concept of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis, initiating chemical reactions through charge exchange at a solid&#8211;liquid interface, to report a novel process for directly converting methane under ambient conditions. Utilizing the electrification of commercially available Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) with water under ultrasound, we demonstrate how this interaction promote the activation of methane and oxygen molecules. Our results show that the yield of HCHO and CH3OH can reach 467.5 and 151.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, respectively. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to confirm the evolution of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;OOH). Isotope mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to analyze the elemental origin of CH3OH, which can be further oxidized to HCHO. Additionally, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations to assess the reaction energies of FEP with H2O, O2, and CH4 under these conditions. The implications of this methodology, with its potential applicability to a wider array of gas&#8208;phase catalytic reactions, underscore a significant advance in catalysis.

     alt="Contact-Electro-Catalysis for Direct Oxidation of Methane under Ambient Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study pioneers a contact-electro-catalysis technique for converting methane to formaldehyde and methanol under ambient conditions, using electrified fluorinated ethylene propylene with water. Achieving high yield of HCHO, this method significantly advances the field of catalysis by efficiently activating methane with reactive oxygen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of methane under ambient conditions has attracted significant attention. Although advancements have been made using active oxygen species from photo- and electro- chemical processes, challenges such as complex catalyst design, costly oxidants, and unwanted byproducts remain. This study exploits the concept of contact-electro-catalysis, initiating chemical reactions through charge exchange at a solid&#8211;liquid interface, to report a novel process for directly converting methane under ambient conditions. Utilizing the electrification of commercially available Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) with water under ultrasound, we demonstrate how this interaction promote the activation of methane and oxygen molecules. Our results show that the yield of HCHO and CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH can reach 467.5 and 151.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to confirm the evolution of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;OOH). Isotope mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to analyze the elemental origin of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, which can be further oxidized to HCHO. Additionally, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations to assess the reaction energies of FEP with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under these conditions. The implications of this methodology, with its potential applicability to a wider array of gas-phase catalytic reactions, underscore a significant advance in catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RNA&#8208;Templated Peptide Bond Formation Promotes L&#8208;Homochirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the RNA&#8208;peptide world, non&#8208;canonical nucleotides on complementary RNA strands can be used for RNA&#8208;templated peptide bond formation reactions. Both L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids can be loaded onto a donor RNA strand to give an equimolar mixture of products. The isomeric mixture of donor RNA strands can be coupled with an acceptor RNA strand to form the L,L&#8208;homochiral product in good yield and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The world in which we live is homochiral. The ribose units that form the backbone of DNA and RNA are all D&#8208;configured and the encoded amino acids that comprise the proteins of all living species feature an all&#8208;L&#8208;configuration at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. The homochirality of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is essential for folding of the peptides into well&#8208;defined and functional 3D structures and the homochirality of D&#8208;ribose is crucial for helix formation and base&#8208;pairing. The question of why nature uses only encoded L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids is not understood. Herein, we show that an RNA&#8208;peptide world, in which peptides grow on RNAs constructed from D&#8208;ribose, leads to the self&#8208;selection of homo&#8208;L&#8208;peptides, which provides a possible explanation for the homo&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and homo&#8208;L&#8208;amino acid combination seen in nature.

         <title>Charge Transfer Dynamics in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Heterostructures&#8212;Insights by Vibrational&#8208;Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intricate structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid heterostructures used in organic photovoltaics, DSSCs, and organic optoelectronics demand an in&#8208;depth investigation of their functional interface. This minireview offers a perspective on the application of time&#8208;resolved vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy for exploring the charge dynamics and their influence on the interfacial structure of these devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures play a pivotal role in modern electronic and optoelectronic applications including photodetectors and field effect transistors, as well as in solar energy conversion such as photoelectrodes of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and in organic photovoltaics. To a large extent, performance of such devices is controlled by charge transfer dynamics at and across (inner) interfaces, e.g., between a wide band gap semiconductor and molecular sensitizers and/or catalysts. Hence, a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;dynamics&#8208;function relationship of such functional interfaces is necessary to rationalize possible performance limitations of these materials and devices on a molecular level. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, as an interface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic technique, allows to obtain chemically specific information from interfaces and combines such chemical insights with ultrafast time resolution, when integrated as a spectroscopic probe into a pump&#8208;probe scheme. Thus, this minireview discusses the advantages and potential of VSFG spectroscopy for investigating interfacial charge transfer dynamics and structural changes at inner interfaces. A critical perspective of the unique spectroscopic view of otherwise inaccessible interfaces is presented, which we hope opens new opportunities for an improved understanding of function&#8208;determining processes in complex materials, and brings together communities who are devoted to designing materials and devices with spectroscopists.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Direct Air Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a high&#8208;entropy mechanism, this study uncovers an abnormal phenomenon where oxygen adsorption elongates the N&#8801;N bond, boosting the activation of N2 molecules. The high entropy also significantly reduces the competitive oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in an unprecedented ammonia yield rate. This discovery opens an avenue for high&#8208;entropy research toward practical applications.







Abstract
According to the principles of chemical thermodynamics, the catalytic activation of small molecules (like N2 in air and CO2 in flue gas) generally exhibits a negative activity dependence on O2 owning to the competitive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, some catalysts can show positive activity dependence for N2 electrofixation, an important route to produce ammonia under ambient condition. Here we report that the positive activity dependence on O2 of (Ni0.20Co0.20Fe0.20Mn0.19Mo0.21)3S4 catalyst arises from high&#8208;entropy mechanism. Through experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate that under the reaction condition in the mixed N2/O2, the adsorption of O2 on high&#8208;entropy catalyst contributes to activating N2 molecules characteristic of elongated N&#8801;N bond lengths. As comparison to the low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy counterparts, high entropy can play the second role of attenuating competitive ORR by displaying a negative exponential entropy&#8208;ORR activity relationship. Accordingly, benefiting from the O2, the system for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an ammonia yield rate of 47.70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is even 1.5&#8197;times of pure N2 feedstock (31.92&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2), overtaking all previous reports for this reaction. We expect the present finding providing an additional dimension to high entropy that leverages systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COF) exhibits ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps). A favorable H2O2 generation mechanism via Yeager&#8208;type *O2&#8226;&#8208; intermediates in the cyanide active site can be demonstrated. These features contribute to an excellent hydrogen peroxide yield rate of 11&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising route to providing oxidants for various industrial applications. However, the lack of well&#8208;designed photocatalysts for efficient overall H2O2 production in pure water has impeded ongoing research and practical thrusts. Here we present a cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COFs) combining 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TBTN) and benzotrithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (BTT) building blocks with water&#8208;affinity and charge&#8208;separation. The ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps) can be realized by TBTN&#8208;COF, resulting in a hole accumulated BTT and electron&#8208;rich TBTN building block. Under one sun, the 11013&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 yield rate of H2O2 can be achieved without any sacrificial agent, outperforming most previous reports. Furthermore, the DFT calculation and in situ DRIFTS spectrums suggesting a Yeager&#8208;type absorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in the cyanide active site, which prohibits the formation of superoxide radical and revealing a favored H2O2 production pathway.

Here we present a cyanide-based covalent organic framework (TBTN-COFs) combining 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-tricarbonitrile (TBTN) and benzotrithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde (BTT) building blocks with water-affinity and charge-separation. The ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&amp;lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps) can be realized by TBTN-COF, resulting in a hole accumulated BTT and electron-rich TBTN building block. Under one sun, the 11013&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; yield rate of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved without any sacrificial agent, outperforming most previous reports. Furthermore, the DFT calculation and in situ DRIFTS spectrums suggesting a Yeager-type absorption of *O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate in the cyanide active site, which prohibits the formation of superoxide radical and revealing a favored H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Highly Oxygenated (Furano)germacranolides Derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective synthesis of six (furano)germacranolides derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus was achieved. The assembly of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered ring of molephantin and tomenphantopin F was enabled by diastereoselective Barbier allylation coupled with Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi macrocyclization. The photoinduced cycloisomerization of molephantin enabled access to four furanogermacranolides, such as tomenphantopin C.







Abstract
Germacranolides, secondary metabolites produced by plants, have garnered academic and industrial interest due to their diverse and complex topology as well as a wide array of pharmacological activities. Molephantin, a highly oxygenated germacranolide isolated from medicinal plants, Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus, has exhibited antitumor, inflammatory, and leishmanicidal activities. Its chemical structure is based on a highly strained ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone with an (E,Z)&#8208;dienone moiety, which is fused with an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and adorned with four successive stereogenic centers. Herein, we report the first synthesis of molephantin in 12 steps starting from readily available building blocks. The synthesis features the highly diastereoselective intermolecular Barbier allylation of the &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde with optically active 3&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;furan&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate and ensuing Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) macrocyclization for the construction of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic framework. This synthetic route enabled access to another germacranolide congener, tomenphantopin F. Furthermore, cycloisomerization of molephantin into 2&#8208;deethoxy&#8208;2&#946;&#8208;hydroxyphantomolin could be facilitated by irradiation with ultraviolet A light (&#955;max=370&#8197;nm), which opened a versatile and concise access to the related furanogermacranolides such as EM&#8208;2, phantomolin, 2&#8208;O&#8208;demethyltomephantopin C, and tomenphantopin C.

         <title>An Ultralow&#8208;concentration and Moisture&#8208;resistant Electrolyte of Lithium Difluoro(oxalato)borate in Carbonate Solvents for Stable Cycling in Practical Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an ultra&#8208;low concentration, moisture&#8208;resistant, and environmentally friendly electrolyte of 0.16&#8197;M LiDFOB/EC&#8208;DMC, which is fully compatible with commercial battery materials, leading to long cycling performance.







Abstract
The electrolyte concentration not only impacts the battery performance but also affects the battery cost and manufacturing. Currently, most studies focus on high&#8208;concentration (&gt;3&#8197;M) or localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (~1&#8197;M); however, the expensive lithium salt imposes a major concern. Most recently, ultralow concentration electrolytes (&lt;0.3&#8197;M) have emerged as intriguing alternatives for battery applications, which feature low cost, low viscosity, and extreme&#8208;temperature operation. However, at such an early development stage, many works are urgently needed to further understand the electrolyte properties. Herein, we introduce an ultralow concentration electrolyte of 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% (0.16&#8197;M) lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) in standard carbonate solvents. This electrolyte exhibits a record&#8208;low salt/solvent mass ratio reported to date, thus pointing to a superior low cost. Furthermore, this electrolyte is highly compatible with commercial Li&#8208;ion materials, forming stable and inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode and graphite anode. Consequently, the LiCoO2&#8208;graphite full cell demonstrates excellent cycling performance. Besides, this electrolyte is moisture&#8208;resistant and effectively suppresses the generation of hydrogen fluoride, which will markedly facilitate the battery assembly and recycling process under ambient conditions.

         <title>Selective Stereoretention of Carbohydrates upon C&#8722;C Cleavage Enabling D&#8208;Glyceric Acid Production with High Optical Purity over a Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative stereostructure&#8208;retention strategy enabled the preservation of a stereogenic center and precise C2&#8722;C3 cleavage in sugars. D&#8208;Glyceric acid production with the highest yield reported to date (86.8&#8201;%) and &gt;99&#8201;% ee was achieved without the use of an asymmetric catalyst. This approach overcomes the current limitation of poor enantioselectivity and suggests new possibilities for chiral chemical production from renewable biomass.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acid production from renewable biomass by chemocatalysis is vitally important for reducing our carbon footprint, but remains underdeveloped. We herein establish a strategy that make use of a stereogenic center of biomass to achieve a rare example of D&#8208;glyceric acid production with the highest yield (86.8&#8201;%) reported to date as well as an excellent ee value (&gt;99&#8201;%). Unlike traditional asymmetric catalysis, chiral catalysts/additives are not required. Ample experiments combined with quantum chemical calculations established the origins of the stereogenic center and catalyst performance. The chirality at C4 in D&#8208;xylose was proved to be retained and successfully delivered to C2 in D&#8208;glyceric acid during C&#8722;C cleavage. The remarkable cooperative&#8208;roles of Ag+ and Ag0 in the constructed Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst are disclosed as the crucial contributors. Ag+ was responsible for low&#8208;temperature activation of D&#8208;xylose, while Ag0 facilitated the generation of active O* from O2. Ag+ and active O* cooperatively promoted the precise cleavage of the C2&#8722;C3 bond, and more importantly O* allowed the immediate fast oxidization of the D&#8208;glyceraldehyde intermediate to stabilize D&#8208;glyceric acid, thereby inhibiting the side reaction that induced racemization. This strategy makes a significant breakthrough in overcoming the limitation of poor enantioselectivity in current chemocatalytic conversion of biomass.

         <title>Upcycling of Carbon Fiber/Thermoset Composites into High&#8208;Performance Elastomers and Repurposed Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane thermosets with CF cloths. Upon heating CFRCs in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, polyurethane thermosets are cleaved into linear polymers, which generates non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and value&#8208;added healable and reprocessable elastomers with high mechanical strength and damage resistance.







Abstract
Recycling of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) based on thermosetting plastics is difficult. In the present study, high&#8208;performance CFRCs are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polyurethane (PU&#8722;AP) thermosets with carbon fiber (CF) cloths. PU&#8722;AP thermosets exhibit a breaking strength of 95.5&#8197;MPa and toughness of 473.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 and contain abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups, which can have strong adhesion with CFs. Because of the high interfacial adhesion between CF cloths and PU&#8722;AP thermosets and high toughness of PU&#8722;AP thermosets, CF/PU&#8722;AP composites possess a high tensile strength of &gt;870&#8197;MPa. Upon heating in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at 100&#8201;&#176;C, the aromatic pinacols in the CF/PU&#8722;AP composites can be cleaved, generating non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and linear polymers that can be converted to high&#8208;performance elastomers. The elastomers are mechanically robust, healable, reprocessable, and damage&#8208;resistant with an extremely high tensile strength of 74.2&#8197;MPa and fracture energy of 149.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2. As a result, dissociation of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites enables the recovery of reusable CF cloths and high&#8208;performance elastomers, thus realizing the upcycling of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites.

Upon heating in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at 100&#8201;&#176;C, the aromatic pinacols in the CF/PU&#8722;AP composites can be cleaved, generating non-destructive CF cloths and linear polymers that can be converted to high-performance elastomers. The elastomers are mechanically robust, healable, reprocessable, and damage-resistant with an extremely high tensile strength of 74.2&#8197;MPa and fracture energy of 149.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, dissociation of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites enables the recovery of reusable CF cloths and high-performance elastomers, thus realizing the upcycling of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reticular Modulation of Piezofluorochromic Behaviors in Organic Molecular Cages by Replacing Non&#8208;Luminous Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent organic molecular cage (OMC) that displays piezochromic behavior has been synthesized by incorporating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores into its structure. Changing the rigidity of the cage by replacing the non&#8208;luminous components enabled further modulation of the flexibility and versatility of the OMCs, with a remarkable luminescence peak shift observed upon hydrostatic compression.







Abstract
Organic piezochromic materials that manifest pressure&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responses are important in various fields such as data storage and anticounterfeiting. The manipulation of piezofluorochromic behaviors for these materials is promising but remains a great challenge. Herein, a non&#8208;luminous components regulated strategy is developed and organic molecular cages (OMCs), a burgeoning class of crystalline organic materials with structural dynamics, are first explored for the design of piezofluorochromic materials with tunable luminescence. A series of OMCs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores, termed Cage&#8197;1&#8211;3, are synthesized and their piezofluorochromic behaviors are investigated by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the sufficient voids between its flexible chromophores offered by the OMC structure, Cage&#8197;1 exhibits thermofluorochromic and piezofluorochromic properties. Moreover, the piezofluorochromic performance of this OMC could be further promoted by replacing its non&#8208;luminous components with improved flexibilities, and a remarkable luminescence peak shift by 150&#8197;nm together with a response sensitivity of 13.8&#8197;nm&#8201;GPa&#8722;1 was achieved upon hydrostatic compression. The cage structure plays a vital role in facilitating efficient and reversible piezofluorochromic behaviors. This study has shed light on the rational design and exploitation of OMCs as an exceptional platform to accomplish customizable piezofluorochromic behaviors and enlarge their potential applications in pressure&#8208;based luminescence.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered J&#8208;Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Therapy Conversion: from Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy to Long&#8208;Lasting Chemodynamic Therapy for Effective Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have become an effective tool for tumor treatment. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) takes advantage of various ROS and enhances therapeutic effects. However, the activation of CDT usually occurs before PDT, which hinders the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and reduces the treatment efficiency.&#160; Herein, we present a light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;system based on molecular aggregation regulation for converting cancer therapy from PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) to a long&#8208;lasting CDT. The ordered J&#8208;aggregation enhances the photodynamic properties of the cyanine moiety while simultaneously suppressing the chemodynamic capabilities of the copper&#8208;porphyrin moiety. Upon light irradiation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs demonstrate strong photodynamic and photothermal effects. Meanwhile, light triggers a rapid degradation of the cyanine backbone, leading to the destruction of the J&#8208;aggregation. As a result, a long&#8208;lasting CDT is sequentially activated, and the sustained generation of &#8226;OH is observed for up to 48 hours, causing potent cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Due to their excellent tumor accumulation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs exhibit effective in vivo tumor ablation through the converting therapy. This work provides a new approach for effectively prolonging the chemodynamic activity in ROS&#8208;based cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Carboxylation of Ketones by Gaseous CO2 at the Air&#8208;water Interface of Aqueous Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a catalyst&#8208;free route for the reduction of carbon dioxide integrated with the formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond at the air/water interface of negatively charged aqueous microdroplets, at ambient temperature. The reactions proceed through carbanion generation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of a ketone followed by nucleophilic addition to CO2. Online mass spectrometry reveals that the product is an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid. Several factors, such as the concentration of the reagents, pressure of CO2 gas, and distance traveled by the droplets, control the kinetics of the reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that water in the microdroplets facilitates this unusual chemistry. Furthermore, such a microdroplet strategy has been extended to seven different ketones. This work demonstrates a green pathway for the reduction of CO2 to useful carboxylated organic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Networks Capable of Retaining Crystalline Periodicity after Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular conformation, crystalline morphology, and properties of photochromic organic crystals can be controlled through photoirradiation, making them promising candidates for functional organic materials. However, photochromic porous molecular crystals with a networked framework structure are rare due to the difficulty in maintaining space that allows for photo&#8208;induced molecular motion in the crystalline state. This study describes a photo&#8208;responsive single crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) network of dihydrodimethylbenzo[e]pyrene derivative 4BDHP. A crystal composed of H&#8208;bonded undulate layers, 4BDHP&#8208;2, underwent photoisomerization in the crystalline state due to loose stacking of the layers, resulting loss of crystallinity. Enantio&#8208;pure crystal (S,S)&#8208;4BDHP&#8208;2, on the other hand, allowed to reveal the structure of the photoisomerized crystal, in which the closed form (4BDHP) and open form (4CPD) were arranged alternately with keeping crystalline periodicity, although side reactions were also implied. The present proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system of a photochromic framework that retains crystalline periodicity after photoisomerization may provide new light&#8208;driven porous functional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A dinuclear metal&#8208;organic cage with four acrylate side chains was prepared by self&#8208;assembly. Precipitation polymerization of the cage with N&#8209;isopropylacrylamide yielded a thermoresponsive nanogel. The host properties of the cage were retained within the gel matrix, endowing the nanogel with the capability to serve as a sorbent for chloride ions in water. Moreover, a heteroleptic cage with the drug abiraterone as co&#8208;ligand was integrated into a nanogel. The addition of chloride ions induced a structural rearrangement of the metal&#8208;ligand assembly, resulting in the gradual release of abiraterone.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Zincation and Alumination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8722;H metalation is the most efficient method to prepare aryl&#8211;zinc and &#8211;aluminium complexes that are ubiquitous nucleophiles. Virtually all C&#8211;H metalation routes to form Al/Zn organometallics require stoichiometric, strong Br&#248;nsted bases with no base&#8208;catalyzed reactions reported. Herein we present a catalytic in amine/ammonium salt (Et3N/[(Et3N)H]+) C&#8211;H metalation process to form aryl&#8208;zinc and aryl&#8208;aluminium complexes. Key to this approach is coupling an endergonic C&#8211;H metalation step with a sufficiently exergonic dehydrocoupling step between the ammonium salt by&#8208;product of C&#8211;H metalation ([(Et3N)H]+) and a Zn&#8211;H or Al&#8211;Me containing complex. This step, forming H2/MeH, makes the overall cycle exergonic while generating more of the reactive metal electrophile. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations revealed metal&#8208;specific dehydrocoupling pathways, with the divergent reactivity due to the different metal valency (which impacts the accessibility of amine&#8208;free cationic metal complexes) and steric environment. Notably, dehydrocoupling in the zinc system proceeds through a ligand&#8208;mediated pathway involving protonation of the b&#8208;diketiminate Cg position. Given this process is applicable to two disparate metals (Zn and Al), other main group metals and ligand sets are expected to be amenable to this transition metal&#8208;free, catalytic C&#8722;H metalation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bayesian Inference for Model Analyses of Supramolecular Complexes: A Case Study with&#160;Nanocarbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 126&#960;&#8208;electron nanobowl molecule, phenine tridehydrosumanene, was synthesized in 12 steps through the development of a polygon cyclization strategy that assembled the polygonal precursors via Ni&#8208;mediated macrocyclization. The bowl&#8208;shaped structure accommodated C70&#160;as a guest at the concave site, and the ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The host&#8208;guest equilibrium in solution was studied with titration experiments using isothermal calorimetry, which provided an interesting test case for studying the host&#8208;guest stoichiometry. Bayesian inference was introduced for stoichiometric analyses of the equilibrium, and a protocol to estimate the volume of prior probability in the parameter space was developed. The Bayesian protocol functioned as Occam's razor and provided quantitative support for a specific stoichiometry. The method was examined with five host&#8208;guest examples comprising nanocarbon hosts, which suggested the versatility of Bayesian inference for studies of supramolecular complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Germaaluminocenes &#8211; Masked Heterofulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germaaluminocenes are formed by salt metathesis reactions of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediides with cyclopentadienylaluminum dichloride. The reactivity pattern of these sandwich complexes is determined by the electrophilic central aluminum atom and by the nucleophilic dicoordinated germanium center. Surprisingly, the products formed by reactions with Lewis acids, Lewis bases, amphiphiles and compounds with polar double bonds are those expected from the reaction of a hypothetical aluminagermapentafulvene with these types of reagents. This suggests that germaaluminocenes are synthetic equivalents to these pentafulvenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Activable Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Assembled from &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthalenediimide for Precision Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nano&#8208;immunomodulator (R&#8208;NPT NP) comprising a tumor microenvironment (TME) activable resiquimod (R848) and a &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing naphthophenanthrolinetetraone (NPT) has been engineered for spatiotemporal controlled photothermal immunotherapy. R&#8208;NPT NP demonstrated excellent photostability, while R848 promoted synergistic immunity as a toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, R&#8208;NPT NP released R848 in response to redox metabolite glutathione (GSH), triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation. The photothermal effect endowed by R&#8208;NPT NP can ablate tumors directly and trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunity after photoirradiation. The synergistic effect of GSH&#8208;liable TLR7/8 agonist and released immunogenic factors leads to a robust evocation of systematic immunity through promoted DC maturation and T cell infiltration. Thus, R&#8208;NPT NP with photoirradiation achieved 99.3% and 98.2% growth inhibition against primary and distal tumors, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Peptide Cysteine Manipulation on Demand and Difficult Protein Chemical Synthesis Enabled by Controllable Acidolysis of N,S&#8208;Benzylidene Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;containing substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals exhibit controllable acidolysis kinetics, which can be applied to selective peptide modification and protein chemical synthesis. Detailed kinetic studies, various examples of peptide modification and the first chemical synthesis of the native PD&#8208;L1 IgV domain were included in this study.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis combining with chemical ligation provides a way to build up customized polypeptides in general, many targets are still presenting challenges for the conventional synthetic process, such as hydrophobic proteins. New methods and strategies are still required to overcome these obstacles. In this study, kinetic studies of Cys/Pen ligation and its acidolysis were performed, from which the fast acidolysis of substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals (NBTs) was discovered. The study demonstrates the potential of NBTs as a promising Cys switchable protection, facilitating the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins by efficiently disrupting peptide aggregation. The compatibility of NBTs with other commonly adopted Cys protecting groups and their applications in sequential disulfide bond formation were also investigated. The first chemical synthesis of the native human programmed death ligand 1 immunoglobulin V&#8208;like (PD&#8208;L1 IgV) domain was achieved using the NBT strategy, showcasing its potential in difficult protein synthesis.

         <title>Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Efficient Electrochemical Water Dissociation and Dechlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immobilization of Co single atoms on the surface oxide layer of titanium foam favors the rapid diffusion of generated atomic hydrogen to adjacent Co single atoms through the reverse hydrogen spillover effect for more efficient electrochemical dechlorination of chloramphenicol, offering a promising atomic hydrogen utilization strategy for environmental and energy applications.







Abstract
Efficient water dissociation to atomic hydrogen (H*) with restrained recombination of H* is crucial for improving the H* utilization for electrochemical dechlorination, but is currently limited by the lack of feasible electrodes. Herein, we developed a monolithic single&#8208;atom electrode with Co single atoms anchored on the inherent oxide layer of titanium foam (Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti), which can efficiently dissociate water into H* and simultaneously inhibit the recombination of H*, by taking advantage of the single&#8208;atom reverse hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that H* could be rapidly generated on the oxide layer of titanium foam, and then overflowed to the adjacent Co single atom for the reductive dechlorination. Using chloramphenicol as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept verification, the resulting Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti monolithic electrode exhibited an unprecedented performance with almost 100&#8201;% dechlorination at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V, far superior to that of traditional indirect reduction&#8208;driven commercial Pd/C (52&#8201;%) and direct reduction&#8208;driven Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (44&#8201;%). Moreover, its dechlorination rate constant of 1.64&#8197;h&#8722;1 was 4.3 and 8.6 times more active than those of Pd/C (0.38&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (0.19&#8197;h&#8722;1), respectively. Our research sheds light on the rational design of hydrogen spillover&#8208;related electrocatalysts to simultaneously improve the H* generation, transfer, and utilization for environmental and energy applications.

     alt="Cobalt Single-Atom Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Efficient Electrochemical Water Dissociation and Dechlorination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immobilization of Co single atoms on the surface oxide layer of titanium foam favors the rapid diffusion of generated atomic hydrogen to adjacent Co single atoms through the reverse hydrogen spillover effect for more efficient electrochemical dechlorination of chloramphenicol, offering a promising atomic hydrogen utilization strategy for environmental and energy applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient water dissociation to atomic hydrogen (H*) with restrained recombination of H* is crucial for improving the H* utilization for electrochemical dechlorination, but is currently limited by the lack of feasible electrodes. Herein, we developed a monolithic single-atom electrode with Co single atoms anchored on the inherent oxide layer of titanium foam (Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti), which can efficiently dissociate water into H* and simultaneously inhibit the recombination of H*, by taking advantage of the single-atom reverse hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that H* could be rapidly generated on the oxide layer of titanium foam, and then overflowed to the adjacent Co single atom for the reductive dechlorination. Using chloramphenicol as a proof-of-concept verification, the resulting Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti monolithic electrode exhibited an unprecedented performance with almost 100&#8201;% dechlorination at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V, far superior to that of traditional indirect reduction-driven commercial Pd/C (52&#8201;%) and direct reduction-driven Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&#8722;C (44&#8201;%). Moreover, its dechlorination rate constant of 1.64&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was 4.3 and 8.6 times more active than those of Pd/C (0.38&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&#8722;C (0.19&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

         <title>The Stability of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ion&#8208;Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The general trend of a decrease in the stability of the Hydrogen(H)&#8208;bonded complexes with an increase in solvent polarity is being challenged in this work for the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complexes. Our investigations of the binding free energy show an increase in the stability of the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complex with an increase in solvent polarity. The findings are confirmed by experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation, slow&#8208;growth molecular dynamics methods.







Abstract
The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion&#8208;pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent&#8208;accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase. In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex between 2&#8208;fluoropropionic acid and n&#8208;butylamine (CH3CHFCOO&#8722;&#8230;NH3But+) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems.

         <title>Synchronous Regulation of D&#8211;Band Centers in Zn Substrates and Weakening Pauli Repulsion of Zn Ions Using the Ascorbic Acid Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vitamin C molecule tends to regulate the d band center of the Zn substrate as well as adjust the solvation structure. Under this circumstance, active H+ was fixed to the Zn substrate so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was restrained, and the Zn deposition was uniform.







Abstract
The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300&#8197;cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.

         <title>Elastic Relaxor Ferroelectric by Thiol&#8208;ene Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor ferroelectrics possess unique advantages, such as high electric&#8208;mechanical responsiveness and high sensitivity to changes in electric fields, which can be potentially employed as the energy storage and actuation in wearable electronics. Herein, we propose a novel approach utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click reaction to develop elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, which is under a mild condition and a compatible procedure with photolithography.







Abstract
As ferroelectrics hold significance and application prospects in wearable devices, the elastification of ferroelectrics becomes more and more important. Nevertheless, achieving elastic ferroelectrics requires stringent synthesis conditions, while the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric materials remains unexplored, presenting an untapped potential for utilization in energy storage and actuation for wearable electronics. The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction offers a mild and rapid reaction platform to prepare functional polymers. Therefore, we employed this approach to obtain an elastic relaxor ferroelectric by crosslinking an intramolecular carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (CF=CH) polymer matrix with multiple thiol groups via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The resulting elastic relaxor ferroelectric demonstrates pronounced relaxor&#8208;type ferroelectric behaviour. This material exhibits low modulus, excellent resilience, and fatigue resistance, maintaining a stable ferroelectric response even under strains up to 70&#8201;%. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient approach for the construction of elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, thereby expanding the application possibilities in wearable electronics.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Diorganyl Bis(pyridylimino) Isoindolide Aluminum(III) Complexes and Their Organometallic Radical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the synthesis of varied bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide aluminum complexes and a detailed study of its charge&#8208;transfer induced metal&#8208;carbon bond homolysis in a transition&#8208;metal mimicking fashion as well as following reactivity studies.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8722;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA) of solvents dominate their reductive stability and delineate the SEI formed on Li or silicon (Si) anodes. Electrolyte with a high reductive stability achieves a high retention rate of 82&#8201;% after 100 cycles in anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells.







Abstract
Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81&#8201;% (1910&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82&#8201;% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

         <title>Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) metalloradical has been isolated and fully characterized. Upon coordination of CO, it confers a significant amount of spin density from the metal to the carbon atom. The carbon centered radical reactivity was investigated towards the homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage of a bulky disulfide.







Abstract
A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8722;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(tert&#8208;butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage and C&#8722;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester.

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based compounds that can self&#8208;assemble in a lipid bilayer and show ion transport aided by halogen bonding in addition to hydrogen bonding have been reported. Ion transport studies show that the hexyl&#8208;substituted derivative exhibits the highest level of activity compared to the other derivatives.







Abstract
Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.

         <title>Porous Ceramic Metal&#8208;Based Flow Battery Composite Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid hierarchical porous ceramic MF membrane coated with small amounts of a polyelectrolyte was used in a zinc&#8208;iron flow battery. The rigid porous structure of the ceramic membrane not only provided fast ion transport channels but also prevented dendrite formation and enhanced zinc deposition within the ceramic cavities, significantly increasing the areal capacity up to 260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintained an average EE of &gt;80&#8201;% for more than 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
In metal&#8208;based flow battery, membranes significantly impact energy conversion efficiency and security. Unfortunately, damages to the membrane occur due to gradual accumulation of metal dendrites, causing short circuits and shortening cycle life. Herein, we developed a rigid hierarchical porous ceramic flow battery composite membrane with a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polyelectrolyte coating to achieve high ion selectivity and conductivity, to restrain dendrite, and to realize long cycle life and high areal capacity. An aqueous zinc&#8208;iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability (over 1000&#8197;h) and extremely high areal capacity (260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, and nano&#8208;computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.

         <title>Rational Lithium Salt Molecule Tuning for Fast Charging/Discharging Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By attaching an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group near N atom, the distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI, which enhances ionic separation degree and achieves a more balanced donor number and tuned self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of lithium metal batteries with this self&#8208;folded lithium salt is progressively improved.







Abstract
The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self&#8208;folded lithium salt, lithium 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N&#8208;[2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self&#8208;folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self&#8208;cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra&#8208;thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.

The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self-cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic self&#8208;stratifying batteries provided a new direction in batter philosophy due to their excellent features (revolutionary membrane&#8208;free architecture, flexibility, cost&#8208;effectiveness, etc.). This minireview provides a timely review of emerging BSBs in next&#8208;generation energy storage, deciphering their underlying principles, research paradigms, outcomes, and challenges.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale energy storage devices play pivotal roles in effectively harvesting and utilizing green renewable energies (such as solar and wind energy) with capricious nature. Biphasic self&#8208;stratifying batteries (BSBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for grid energy storage owing to their membraneless architecture and innovative battery design philosophy, which holds promise for enhancing the overall performance of the energy storage system and reducing operation and maintenance costs. This minireview aims to provide a timely review of such emerging energy storage technology, including its fundamental design principles, existing categories, and prototype architectures. The challenges and opportunities of this undergoing research topic will also be systematically highlighted and discussed to provide guidance for the subsequent R&amp;D of superior BSBs while conducive to bridging the gap for their future practical application.

         <title>Mechanochemical Birch Reduction with Low Reactive Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation boosts reducing power of magnesium and calcium, allowing to utilize these metals as expedient reductants in ammonia&#8208;free Birch reaction in a ball mill at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Birch reduction and similar dissolved metal&#8208;type transformations hold significant importance in the organic synthesis toolbox. Historically, the field has been dominated by alkali metal reductants. In this study, we report that largely neglected, low&#8208;reactive alkaline earth metals can become powerful and affordable reductants when used in a ball mill under essentially solvent&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of ethylenediamine and THF as liquid additives. Calcium can reduce both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich arenes, with yields of products similar to those obtained with lithium metal. Magnesium reveals enhanced reducing power, enabling the reduction of benzoic acids while keeping electron&#8208;rich aromatic moieties intact and allows for chemoselective transformations. The developed mechanochemical approach uses readily available and safer&#8208;to&#8208;handle metals, operates under air and ambient temperature conditions, and can be used for gram&#8208;scale preparations. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed conditions can be used for other dissolved metal&#8208;type reductive transformations, including reductive amination, deoxygenation, dehalogenation, alkene and alkyne reductions.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of four stereoisomers of DAT2, an important antigen of M. tuberculosis, showed that the commonly accepted structure of DAT2 and its acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid had to be corrected. DAT2 is an effective ligand activating Mincle, an important pattern recognition receptor of the immune system.







Abstract
DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereoisomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. A rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC, and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four stereoisomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>Metalloradical Catalysis: General Approach for Controlling Reactivity and Selectivity of Homolytic Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC) represents a versatile approach for controlling reactivity and selectivity in radical chemistry. By harnessing metalloradicals as one&#8208;electron catalysts, MRC facilitates the homolytic activation of substrates, leading to the generation of metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as pivotal intermediates. The distinctive stepwise radical mechanism in MRC paves the way for innovative advancements in the field of organic synthesis.







Abstract
Since Friedrich W&#246;hler's groundbreaking synthesis of urea in 1828, organic synthesis over the past two centuries has predominantly relied on the exploration and utilization of chemical reactions rooted in two&#8208;electron heterolytic ionic chemistry. While one&#8208;electron homolytic radical chemistry is both rich in fundamental reactivities and attractive with practical advantages, the synthetic application of radical reactions has been long hampered by the formidable challenges associated with the control over reactivity and selectivity of high&#8208;energy radical intermediates. To fully harness the untapped potential of radical chemistry for organic synthesis, there is a pressing need to formulate radically different concepts and broadly applicable strategies to address these outstanding issues. In pursuit of this objective, researchers have been actively developing metalloradical catalysis (MRC) as a comprehensive framework to guide the design of general approaches for controlling over reactivity and stereoselectivity of homolytic radical reactions. Essentially, MRC exploits the metal&#8208;centered radicals present in open&#8208;shell metal complexes as one&#8208;electron catalysts for homolytic activation of substrates to generate metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as the key intermediates to govern the reaction pathway and stereochemical course of subsequent catalytic radical processes. Different from the conventional two&#8208;electron catalysis by transition metal complexes, MRC operates through one&#8208;electron chemistry utilizing stepwise radical mechanisms.

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product chlorotonil was modified by late&#8208;stage functionalization and novel reactions. After modifying new positions, activity and selectivity were shown against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Lacking chlorine groups critical for toxicity, the new substance, dehalogenil, was tested in vivo showing strongly improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy in different mouse models of S. aureus infection.







Abstract
The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability, but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S. aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.

         <title>Highly Selective Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction Over Cd&#8208;Decorated Cu Catalyst with Efficiently Inhibited Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;decoration breaks the inherent property of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling over Cu&#8208;based catalysts for acetylene electroreduction reaction, achieving a significantly inhibited C4H6 Faradaic efficiency of 0.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene feed gas and an ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% in a simulated crude ethylene feedstock.







Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) employing Cu catalysts represents an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective method for ethylene production and purification. However, Cu&#8208;based catalysts encounter product selectivity issues stemming from carbon&#8208;carbon coupling and other side reactions. We explored the use of secondary metals to modify Cu&#8208;based catalysts and identified Cd decoration as particular effective. Cd decoration demonstrated a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.38&#8201;% with well&#8208;inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions (0.06&#8201;% for butadiene FE at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene gas feed. Notably, ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% was achieved in the crude ethylene feed during prolonged stability tests. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cd metal accelerates the water dissociation on neighboring Cu surfaces allowing more H* to participate in the acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, while increasing the energy barrier for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling, thereby contributing to a high ethylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation efficiency and significant inhibition of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. This study provides a paradigm for a deeper understanding of secondary metals in regulating the product selectivity of EAR electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Future of Chemical Sciences is Sustainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content:Utilizing Taylor&#8211;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion was utilized for avoiding serious interferences occurring during the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of intact proteins without resorting to any pre&#8208;separation or sample purification techniques. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of large components since their diffusion constants are very small compared to those of the other components in the sample.







Abstract
This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8211;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5&#8197;&#956;L sample is injected into a 65&#8197;cm long 50&#8197;&#956;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1&#8197;bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry is put forward based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. The reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high&#8208;yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on-plate nanomole-scale parallel synthesis, DNA-encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium-nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high-yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole-scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo-Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole-scale synthesis of Se-containing natural product library and DNA-encoded library (DEL), late-stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced dehydrogenation of indigo on silver transforms its central double bond into a single bond, providing an unprecedented pathway for the previously restricted rotation of the indole moieties. On Ag(111), we realized 1D coordination polymers of (trans&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) which were thermally switched to (cis&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) polymers.







Abstract
Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the trans configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the trans to the cis configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.

         <title>The Photosalient Effect and Thermochromic Luminescence Based on o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Assisted &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Crystalline State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing the two fates of the formed excimer in the excited state, two distinctive stimuli responsiveness were obtained from the &#960;&#8208;stacking crystal structure of anthracene appended o&#8208;carborane derivatives. One is the dynamic motion initiated by UV light irradiation, called as photosalient effect. The other one is the thermochromic luminescence originated form the change of luminescent species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the unique multiple&#8208;stimuli responsiveness of anthracene&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We designed and synthesized anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions and numbers of the o&#8208;carborane units. Two compounds had characteristic crystal structures involving the columnar &#960;&#8208;stacking structures of the anthracene units. From the analysis of crystalline&#8208;state structure&#8211;property relationships, it was revealed that the crystals exhibited the photosalient effect accompanied by photochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reactions and temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical dual&#8208;emission properties including excimer emission of anthracene. Those properties were considered as non&#8208;radiative and radiative deactivation pathways through the excimer formation in the excited state and the formation of excimer species was facilitated by the &#960;&#8208;stacking structure of anthracene units. Moreover, we found unusual temperature dependency on the occurrence of the photosalient effect. According to the data from variable temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography, a strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and strain accumulation is suggested.

         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives was developed. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride that can be further diversified to a diversity of N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds including amides, carbamates, ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates with rich functionality.







Abstract
Fluorinated small molecules are commonly used in functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are particularly intriguing due to their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Here, guided by computation, we present a simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol involves a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides through desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a variety of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Additionally, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their potential application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrosynthesis of High Value&#8208;Added Active Chlorine Coupled with H2 Generation from Direct Seawater Electrolysis through Decoupling Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system is developed for energy&#8208;saving electrosynthesis of HClO and H2. This system requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared with direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V).







Abstract
Direct saline (seawater) electrolysis is a well&#8208;recognized system to generate active chlorine species for the chloride&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, environmental remediation and sterilization over the past few decades. However, the large energy consumption originated from the high cell voltage of traditional direct saline electrolysis system, greatly restricts its practical application. Here, we report an acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system for energy&#8208;saving co&#8208;electrosynthesis of active chlorine and H2. We demonstrate that this system just requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared to direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V). We further demonstrate that such acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system could be extended to realize energy&#8208;saving and sustainable seawater electrolysis. The acidified seawater in this system can absolutely avoid the formation of Ca/Mg&#8208;based sediments that always form in the seawater electrolysis system. We also prove that this system in the half&#8208;flow mode can realize real&#8208;time preparation of active chlorine used for sterilization and pea sprout production.

         <title>Reductive Retrocyclization of a Mangana(II)cyclopentasilane to Form Manganese(0) Bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mangana(II)cyclopentasilanes were transformed into manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization induced by ligand exchange. An XPS analysis revealed the formation of a zero&#8208;valent manganese complex. The thermolysis of the bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via a formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;exchange reactions on a mangana(II)cyclopentasilane complex that contains two THF ligands with aryl isocyanides led to the formation of manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization. In stark contrast, ligand&#8208;exchange reactions with CNtBu, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, or pyridine&#8208;based ligands furnished manganese(II) complexes wherein the manganacyclopentasilane framework remained intact. The thermolysis of the obtained bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via the formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties. The insertion of a mesityl isocyanide into the Mn&#8722;Si&#946; bond results in the formation of a manganese(II) complex supported by a [SiCSi]&#8208;type tridentate ligand scaffold.

         <title>A Boron Scan of Ethyl Acetoacetate Leads to Versatile Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.







Abstract
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either 
&#8208; or 
&#8208;position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl 
&#8208;ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative rhodium(III)/chiral carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes, is described. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.







Abstract
The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8722;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Polar Aromatic Two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson Halide Perovskites for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with distinct spontaneous polarization (Ps) intensities were synthesized by incorporating isostructural aromatic diammoniums as spacers. Remarkably, due to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of the photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI.







Abstract
Polar materials with spontaneous polarization (Ps) have emerged as highly promising photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution owing to the Ps&#8208;enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. However, traditional inorganic polar materials often suffer from limitations such as wide band gaps and poor carrier transport, which hinders their photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency. Here, we rationally synthesized a series of isostructural two&#8208;dimensional (2D) aromatic Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites, namely (2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (2&#8208;APDPI), (3&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (3&#8208;APDPI), and (4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (4&#8208;APDPI), where 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI crystalize in polar space groups with piezoelectric constants (d33) of approximately 40&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1 and 3&#8208;APDPI adopts a centrosymmetric structure. Strikingly, owing to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI. As a pioneering study, this work provides an efficient approach for exploring new polar photocatalysts and highlights their potential in promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution.

         <title>Designing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membranes for Isomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To well separate pairs of hydrocarbon isomers, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed. Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 membranes are fabricated for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes with middle pore size are constructed for n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation. Additionally, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smallest pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based separation has the merit of low carbon footprint. In this study, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed for discriminating various pairs of hydrocarbon isomers. Specifically, Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo) membranes are developed for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. For n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation, the functional groups and proportion of the ligands in UiO&#8208;66 are gradually adjusted to effectively regulate the pore size, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes are constructed. In addition, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smaller pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>De Novo Designed Ru(II) Metallacycle as a Microenvironment&#8208;Adaptive Sonosensitizer and Sonocatalyst for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Biofilms Eradication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is proposed to boost the reactive oxygen species&#8208;generation capability, resulting in the development of the first example of a supramolecular sonosensitizer (Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD). Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD effectively overcame challenges posed by the complex biofilm microenvironment, including hypoxia, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and hypopermeability for amplifying sonotherapeutic efficacy in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant biofilms.







Abstract
Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle&#8208;based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD&#8217;s production of ultrasonic&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;&#8208;expansion approach. Within the BME, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple&#8208;modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD sono&#8208;catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>

Nonpolar pore environments with N/O active sites in a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) are generated for ethylene purification and propylene recovery. The material exhibits the good balance between excellent separation performance, facile scale synthesis, economic feasibility and high stability for applications.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3&#8197;hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.

         <title>Confinement of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore Zeolite for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) was used as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting photocatalytic HI splitting. The superior activity of the composite was the result of exposed active sites, excellent I3&#8722; adsorption and facile molecular/ionic transfer and diffusion, suitable band gap, as well as good stability.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs), renowned for their outstanding optoelectronic properties, hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of catalytically active sites of bulky MHPs seriously impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (3.4&#8197;nm) for boosting hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting. The as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability in acidic media, along with intrinsic extra&#8208;large pores of ZEO&#8208;1 that were favorable for molecule/ion adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO&#8208;1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3) under visible light irradiation compared with bulk CsPbBr3 (11&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), and the long&#8208;term durability (36&#8197;h) can be achieved. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well&#8208;dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO&#8208;1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity (4826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), surpassing most of the Pt&#8208;integrated perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics investigation revealed that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite&#8208;confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;Step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of C5/C6 alkane isomers for octane upgrading of gasoline was achieved for the first time by one single material, an unprecedented scalable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Fe trimers and pyrazole&#8208;carboxylate ligands with a multi&#8208;cage structure with flu&#8208;e topology.







Abstract
The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane&#8811;n&#8208;pentane&#8776;2&#8208;methylpentane&gt;3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&#8811;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane&#8776;i&#8208;pentane&#8776;2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic molecular catalysts with different coordination environments were synthesized to enhance electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) for efficient ammonia (NH3) production. The best catalyst with N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration exhibited superior activity, achieving over 94&#8201;% NH3 Faradaic efficiency. The research highlights the impact of coordinating subunits on the electronic structures and activity towards eNO3RR and establishes a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90&#8201;% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94&#8201;% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of 11.28&#8197;mg&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28&#8197;s&#8722;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing non&#8208;planar monomers to regulate the interlayer stacking of covalent triazine framework (CTF) membranes formed by planar monomers, we can exert effective control over the pore size in the staggered stacking structure of CTF membrane. Through the coordinated adjustment of stacking space and pore surface properties, the effective separation of aromatic/aliphatic organic mixtures in all&#8208;liquid phase has been successfully realized.







Abstract
Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200&#8197;Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.

However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix-monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200&#8197;Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all-liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Organic Chiral Crystals with Thermal and Excitation Modulation of the Emission for Information Transmission, Writing, and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible crystals of chiral enantiomers have been found to be capable of a fast, reversible, highly robust, and fatigueless photoresponse that can be modulated by both the intensity of excitation light and temperature. Combining the advantages of chiral signals, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, they hold potential for a wide range of applications, such as on&#8208;demand information transfer, storage, and cryptographic displays.







Abstract
Organic single crystals quickly emerge as dense yet light and nearly defect&#8208;free media for emissive elements. Integration of functionalities and control over the emissive properties is currently being explored for a wide range of these materials to benchmark their performance against organic emissive materials diluted in powders or films. Here, we report mechanically flexible emissive chiral organic crystals capable of an unprecedented combination of fast, reversible, and low&#8208;fatigue responses. UV&#8208;excited single crystals of both enantiomers of the material, 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;phenylidene)imino)methyl)phenol, exhibit a drastic yet reversible change in the emission color from green to orange&#8208;yellow within a second and can be cycled at least 2000&#8197;times. The photoresponse was found to depend strongly on the excitation intensity and temperature. Combining chirality, mechanical compliance, rapid emission switching, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, this material provides a unique and versatile platform for developing organic crystal&#8208;based materials for on&#8208;demand signal transfer, information storage, and cryptography.

         <title>Custom&#8208;Design of Strong Electron/Proton Extractor on COFs for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We custom&#8208;designed a strong electron/proton extractor on COFs by introducing oxygen functional groups (&#8722;COOH and &#8722;SO3H) in high&#8208;crystalline triazine&#8208;containing COFs, which induces well&#8208;oriented build&#8208;in electron field and enhances the hydrophilicity, leading to fast proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process and enhanced O2 adsorption, and therefore boosted photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of photocatalysts with continuous electron extraction and rapid proton transfer could kinetically accelerate the artificial photosynthesis, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report the topology&#8208;guided synthesis of a high&#8208;crystalline triazine covalent organic framework (COF) decorated by uniformly distributed polar oxygen functional groups (sulfonic group or carboxyl) as the strong electron/proton extractor for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. It was found that the polarity&#8208;based proton transfer as well as electron enrichment in as&#8208;obtained COFs played a crucial role in improving the H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency (i.e., with an activity order of sulfonic acid&#8208; (SO3H&#8208;COF)&gt;carboxyl&#8208; (COOH&#8208;COF)&gt;hydrogen&#8208; (H&#8208;COF) functionalized COFs). The strong polar sulfonic acid group in the high&#8208;crystalline SO3H&#8208;COF triggered a well&#8208;oriented built&#8208;in electric field and more hydrophilic surface, which serves as an efficient carrier extractor enabling a continuous transportation of the photogenerated electrons and interfacial proton to the active sites (i.e., C atoms linked to &#8722;SO3H group). As&#8208;accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, a quantum yield of 15&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm is obtained, superior to most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Organic Polymer as Multifunctional Interfacial Layers for Ultra&#8208;Long Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial layer with external micromagnetic field, Co&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (denoted as Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP), is demonstrated to regulate the Li+ relative local environment and induce uniform Li deposition. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and the Co sites and their underlying working mechanism are revealed.







Abstract
Fatal issues in lithium metal anodes (LMA), such as detrimental lithium dendrites growth and fragile solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the Li plating/stripping process, often hinder the practical application of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, cobalt&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP) is constructed as the protective layer for regulating the interface stability of LMA. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and Co sites not only regulate the Li+ coordination environment and rearrange Li+ concentration to facilitate its transport by optimizing the electronic density, enhancing the compatibility with electrolyte interface and supplying &#8220;external magnetic driving strategy&#8221;, but also strengthens the interfacial stiffness with high Young's modulus to better withstand the mechanical stress. These beneficial effects and relative underlying working mode and mechanism of uniform Li plating and rapid Li+ migration on the Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP are also revealed by various in situ/ex situ experimental technologies and theory calculation. The Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP&#8208;based cell delivers an extraordinary lifespan of 6600&#8197;h and ultrahigh capacity retention of 78.3&#8201;% (111.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This demonstrated synergistic strategy in Co&#8208;coordinated organic polymer may gain new insights to regulate the uniform and non&#8208;dendritic deposition/dissolution behaviors for highly stable LMBs.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Hollow Nanoporous Carbon Architectures by Controlling MOF Crystalline Inhomogeneity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is for the first time found that single&#8208;component MOFs (STU&#8208;1) crystals with inner crystalline inhomogeneity could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) through an unexplored spontaneous hollowing mechanism. The obtain HNCs can act as a high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) present significant utilitarian value for a wide variety of applications. Facile and efficient preparation of HNCs has long been pursued but still remains challenging. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals, rather than the widely reported hybrid ones which necessitate tedious operations for preparation, could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of functional HNCs. By controlling the growth kinetics, the MOFs crystals (STU&#8208;1) are readily engineered into different shapes with designated styles of crystalline inhomogeneity. A subsequent one&#8208;step pyrolysis of these MOFs with intraparticle difference can induce a simultaneous self&#8208;hollowing and carbonization process, thereby producing various functional HNCs including yolk&#8208;shell polyhedrons, hollow microspheres, mesoporous architectures, and superstructures. Superior to the existing methods, this synthetic strategy relies only on the complex nature of single&#8208;component MOFs crystals without involving tedious operations like coating, etching, or ligand exchange, making it convenient, efficient, and easy to scale up. An ultra&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion battery anode is demonstrated by the HNCs with extraordinary cyclability (93&#8201;% capacity retention over 8000 cycles), highlighting a high level of functionality of the HNCs.

Superior to the existing methods, this synthetic strategy relies only on the complex nature of single-component MOFs crystals without involving tedious operations like coating, etching, or ligand exchange, making it convenient, efficient, and easy to scale up. An ultra-stable Na-ion battery anode is demonstrated by the HNCs with extraordinary cyclability (93&#8201;% capacity retention over 8000 cycles), highlighting a high level of functionality of the HNCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Manipulating the Intermolecular Interactions through Side Chain Fluorine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of precisely controlled fluorine atoms into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptors substantially increased the overall average electrostatic potential and charge balance factor. This enhancement improved intermolecular interaction, allowing for precise tuning of molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Fluorine side chain functionalization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) represents an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, a knowledge gap persists regarding the relationship between structural changes induced by fluorine functionalization and the resultant impact on device performance. In this work, varying amounts of fluorine atoms were introduced into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs to construct two acceptors named BTP&#8208;F0 and BTP&#8208;F5. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that side&#8208;chain fluorination significantly increase the overall average electrostatic potential (ESP) and charge balance factor, thereby effectively improving the ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular electrostatic interaction, and thus precisely tuning the molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Therefore, the BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based OSC exhibited enhanced crystallinity, domain purity, reduced domain spacing, and optimized phase distribution in the vertical direction. This facilitates exciton diffusion, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. Consequently, the promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;% were achieved in BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices, respectively, surpassing the PCE of 16.1&#8201;% for BTP&#8208;F0&#8208;based OSCs. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and demonstrates that fluorine functionalization of the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs is a compelling strategy for achieving ideal phase separation for highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new b&#8208;type phenyl diselenide cathode with self&#8208;healing diselenide bond active site is developed, showing evident superiority to conventional b&#8208;type organic cathodes with organic active groups in terms of redox potential and reversible capacity. During charge/discharge processes, the diselenide bond is periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with cation/anion charge carriers, enabling a high&#8208;energy and durable aqueous Zn battery.







Abstract
Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8722; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8722;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3&#8201;||&#8201;Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDSe&#8722;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4&#8197;V), high energy density (578.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgPDSe&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (12&#8201;000 cycles) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.

         <title>Negatively Curved Octagon&#8208;Incorporated Aza&#8208;nanographene and its Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure has led to the synthesis of a negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene containing two octagons, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron&#8208;rich nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of the saddle&#8208;shaped structure lead to intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as tight association with fullerenes (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60 and Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70).







Abstract
A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized by a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, in which a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate. Their saddle&#8208;shaped structures with negative curvature were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, thereby enabling the exploration of the structure&#8211;property relationship by photophysical, electrochemical and conformational studies. Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, with record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60, Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70) found among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds. The tight association of aza&#8208;NG with C60 was further elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of their co&#8208;crystal, which showed the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with substantial concave&#8208;convex interactions.

         <title>Controlling the Phase Transformation of Alumina for Enhanced Stability and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

Optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.







Abstract
Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#8201;&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low&#8208;surface&#8208;area &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter. These specific surface sites provide favorable interactions with supported metal catalysts, leading to improved metal dispersion and greatly enhanced catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The results presented herein not only provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &#945;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the specific surface sites on the latter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#8201;&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low-surface-area &#945;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &#945;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the specific surface sites on the latter. These specific surface sites provide favorable interactions with supported metal catalysts, leading to improved metal dispersion and greatly enhanced catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The results presented herein not only provide molecular-level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ir&#8208;Doped CuPd Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Nanotetrahedrons for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Electrocatalysis: Enhanced Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) were facilely prepared through an aqueous surfactant&#8208;templating epitaxial growth strategy. With mesoporous channels and multi&#8208;compositions, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs delivered remarkable C&#8722;C bond cleavage of electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) to C1 products. The Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed perfectly in coupled electrocatalysis of EGOR and nitrate reduction.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells is of decisive importance to hold higher energy efficiency. Despite some achievements, their progress, especially electrocatalytic selectivity to complete oxidated C1 products, is remarkably slower than expected. In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The synthesis relied on precise reduction/co&#8208;nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra Br&#8722; as the facet&#8208;selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well&#8208;defined (111) facets, single&#8208;crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8722;C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of C&#8722;SCF3 Stereocenters via Nickel Catalyzed Asymmetric Negishi Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of chiral SRf (SCF3, SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9 and SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon centers with high enantioselectivities was developed by a nickel catalyzed asymmetric Negishi coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this strategy was demonstrated in a gram scale reaction and the syntheses of optical analogues of bioactive compounds by introducing SCF3 groups without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of the SCF3&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon stereocenters with high enantioselectivities is reported via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling strategy. This method demonstrates simple operations, mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, with newly designed SCF3&#8208;containing synthon, which can be easily obtained from commercially available benzyl bromide and trifluoromethylthio anion in a two&#8208;step manner. Further substrate exploration indicated that the reaction system could be extended to diverse perfluoroalkyl sulfide (SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9, SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this transformation was further demonstrated by convenient derivatization to optical SCF3&#8208;containing analogues of bioactive compounds without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Diboraperylene Diborinic Acid Self&#8208;Assembly on Ag(111)&#8212;Kagome Flat Band Localized States Imaged by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>

A planar diboraperylene diborinic acid B2&#8722;Per self&#8208;assembles into a chiral kagome supramolecular network on an Ag(111) substrate and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between BOH subunits of adjacent molecules. The kagome supramolecular network exhibits a dispersionless flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level, which is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and further proved by tight&#8208;binding model calculations.







Abstract
Replacement of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by boron affords electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;scaffolds due to the vacant pz&#8208;orbital of three&#8208;coordinate boron with the potential for pronounced electronic interactions with electron&#8208;rich metal surfaces. Using a diboraperylene diborinic acid derivative as precursor and a controlled on&#8208;surface non&#8208;covalent synthesis approach, we report on a self&#8208;assembled chiral supramolecular kagome network on an Ag(111) surface stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at low temperature. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal a flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level which is localized at the molecule center, in good agreement with tight&#8208;binding model calculations of flat bands characteristic for kagome lattices.

         <title>The Construction of Anion&#8208;Induced Solvation Structures in Low&#8208;concentration Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte was designed, where the CIPs and SSHIPs were achieved at low concentration by the coordination of PCA&#8722; with Zn2+ and bonding with solvated H2O molecules. This electrolyte effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions on Zn anodes even at low concentration.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices because of their low cost and high safety. However, owing to the high activity of H2O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion&#8208;pairs and solvent&#8208;shared ion&#8208;pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&#8722; anions coordinate with Zn2+ and bond with solvated H2O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&#8722; anions also induce the construction of H&#8208;bonds between free H2O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&#8722; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H2O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water&#8208;triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43&#8201;% in PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

However, owing to the high activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive-free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion-pairs and solvent-shared ion-pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions coordinate with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and bond with solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions also induce the construction of H-bonds between free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water-triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43&#8201;% in PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transient Metallo&#8208;Lipidoid Assemblies Amplify Covalent Catalysis of Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient metallo&#8208;lipidoid supramolecular assembly is constructed utilizing a ligand L1 and a tetracoordinate chelating agent NTA&#8208;R. The self&#8208;assembled vesicular structures upregulate the catalysis of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous chemical reactions. The metal ions facilitate transient activation of the assembly, thereby enabling temporal control of the catalytic chemical reactions.







Abstract
Dissipative supramolecular assemblies are hallmarks of living systems, contributing to their complex, dynamic structures and emerging functions. Living cells can spatiotemporally control diverse biochemical reactions in membrane compartments and condensates, regulating metabolite levels, signal transduction or remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Herein, we constructed membranous compartments using self&#8208;assembly of lipid&#8208;like amphiphiles (lipidoid) in aqueous medium. The new double&#8208;tailed lipidoid features Cu(II) coordinated with a tetravalent chelator that dictates the binding of two amphiphilic ligands in cis&#8208;orientation. Hydrophobic interactions between the lipidoids coupled with intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to a well&#8208;defined bilayer vesicle structure. Oil&#8208;soluble SNAr reaction is efficiently upregulated in the hydrophobic cavity, acting as a catalytic crucible. The modular system allows easy incorporation of exposed primary amine groups, which augments the catalysis of retro aldol and C&#8722;N bond formation reactions. Moreover, a higher&#8208;affinity chelator enables consumption of the Cu(II) template leveraging the differential thermodynamic stability, which allows a controllable lifetime of the vesicular assemblies. Concomitant temporal upregulation of the catalytic reactions could be tuned by the metal ion concentration. This work offers new possibilities for metal ion&#8208;mediated dynamic supramolecular systems, opening up a massive repertoire of functionally active dynamic &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; materials.

         <title>Backbone Engineering of Polymeric Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Reduction in Bipolar Membrane Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) can mitigate CO2 losses and salt precipitation during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the performance is poor due to the local acidic environment. We report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, achieving a high selectivity of 82.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA/cm2, a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%, and the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating CO2 losses, salt precipitation and high maintenance costs associated with the commonly used anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrode assembly for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the industrial implementation of BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer is hampered by the poor CO2RR performance, largely attributed to the local acidic environment. Here, we report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the CO2RR performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers by covalently grafting cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine onto a positively charged polyfluorene backbone (PF&#8208;CoTAPc). PF&#8208;CoTAPc shows a high acid tolerance in BPM electrode assembly (BPMEA), achieving a high FE of 82.6&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 and a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%. Notably, the CO2RR selectivity, carbon utilization efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of PF&#8208;CoTAPc in BPMEA outperform reported BPM systems. We attribute the enhancement to the stable cationic shield in the double layer and suppression of proton migration, ultimately inhibiting the undesired hydrogen evolution and improving the CO2RR selectivity. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol) for the PF&#8208;CoTAPc catalyst in BPMEA. Our findings provide a viable strategy for designing efficient CO2RR catalysts in acidic environments.

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

We developed a strategy for Ni2+ substitution of Co2+ to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), where Ni plays a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.







Abstract
Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8722; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8722;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8722;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.

A catalyst with three distinct catalytic sites was prepared by doping Pd atoms onto a Cu catalyst, which exhibited high activity for C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The introduced Pd atom is an active site, which can promote the H2O dissociation. The Cu atoms near the Pd atom are another catalytic site, which can enhance the CO conversion. In contrast, the Cu atoms far from the Pd atom are active sites for the CO2 activation.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8722;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8722;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8&#8201;%, even at a high current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 20&#8197;hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70&#8201;% at 1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.

         <title>Coherent Modulation of the Aggregation Behavior and Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Small Molecule Probes for Sensitive and Long&#8208;term Nerve Agent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fully modulating the ICT degree and the AIE property of the solid&#8208;state probes, a colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection strategy is built with boosted response contrast for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP. The proposed probe design strategy would help to open a door for exploring novel probe design methodologies from the aspect of synergistically modulating the molecular structure and the emission behavior.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shows promising performance in chemical sensing relying on the change of the emission behavior of the probe molecule monomers to the aggregated product. However, whether the response contrast could be further boosted by utilizing the emission property of the aggregated probe and the aggregated product remains a big challenge. Here, an exciting AIE probe regulation strategy was proposed by coherently modulating the aggregation behavior and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property of the probes and thus an aggregated&#8208;to&#8208;aggregated colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection was achieved. The blue emissive film obtained with the optimal AIE probe has been proven to be effective to recognize the vapor of nerve agent analog DCP in air by emitting a sharp green fluorescence. In addition, a porous polymer&#8208;based wet sensing chip loaded with the probe enables the immediate response to DCP vapor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7&#8197;ppb, and it was further integrated into a wearable watch device for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP vapor up to two weeks. We expect the present probe design strategy would greatly deepen the AIE&#8208;based science and provide new insights for long&#8208;term monitoring sensors toward trace hazardous substances.

         <title>Enantioselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homochiral Tetrahedral Cage Comprising Only Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, we introduced a chiral amine during the imine formation process. Addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde formed a trisimino intermediate. The chiral intermediate was then combined with achiral trisamino precursor. Imine exchange reaction led to release of the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75&#8201;%, which is composed of achiral building precursors exclusively.







Abstract
How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. In this study, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds&#8211;a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions among the phenyl building blocks within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to the tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 75&#8201;%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. This experimental observation aligns with theoretical calculations based on the free energies of related cage structures. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) with a chiral helical network were constructed from a square&#8208;planar sulfonic acid and p&#8208;position&#8208;modified triphenylmethylamine, both achiral components. The chirality of the POSs could be controlled by chiral induction, and the obtained porous materials composed of hydrogen bonds exhibited solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study highlights applications for POSs as chiral materials.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).

The POS consisting of &lt;b&gt;spiroBPS&lt;/b&gt; and triphenylmethylamine (&lt;b&gt;TPMA&lt;/b&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;spiroBPS/TPMA&lt;/b&gt;) was constructed from the two-fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with &lt;i&gt;pts&lt;/i&gt; topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4-chlorophenyl)methylamine (&lt;b&gt;TPMA-Cl&lt;/b&gt;) and tris(4-bromophenyl)methylamine (&lt;b&gt;TPMA-Br&lt;/b&gt;), which are bulkier than &lt;b&gt;TPMA&lt;/b&gt; owing to the introduction of halogens at the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-position of the phenyl groups with &lt;b&gt;spiroBPS&lt;/b&gt; allows us to construct novel POSs (&lt;b&gt;spiroBPS/TPMA-Cl&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;spiroBPS/TPMA-Br&lt;/b&gt;). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with &lt;i&gt;pth&lt;/i&gt; topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;spiroBPS/TPMA-Cl&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;pth&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;Oxy Motif: Method Development and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Method development and total synthesis have resulted in the enantioselective synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif, and thus expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids), completed within 4&#8211;7 steps.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif is widely found in various types of bioactive natural products. However, present synthesis is mainly non&#8208;asymmetric which relied upon different olefination or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions using enantioenriched precursors. Herein, based upon a newly developed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of conjugated polyenoic acids, a variety of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif (with E&#8208;configured internal olefin) was generated as the corresponding &#945;&#8208;adducts in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective manner. Utilizing 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif as key intermediates, we further demonstrated their synthetic potential by expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids) within 4&#8211;7 steps.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation over Bicomponent Catalysts through Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium, which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with copper, which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on palladium at low overpotentials and facilitate palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen transfer and timely desorptive hydrogenation on copper. As a result, a record high alkene production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved over this system at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8&#8201;% at a low energy consumption of 1.26&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60&#8197;h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Induced Living Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Supramolecular Polymerization in Water: Implications on Protein Adsorption and Enzyme Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

This work unravels intricate pathway complexity&#8208;driven, controlled two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization in water and its impact on temporally controlled protein&#8208;surface interaction and enzymatic activity.







Abstract
In biological systems, programmable supramolecular frameworks characterized by coordinated directional non&#8208;covalent interactions are widespread. However, only a small number of reports involve pure water&#8208;based dynamic supramolecular assembly of artificial &#960;&#8208;amphiphiles, primarily due to the formidable challenge of counteracting the strong hydrophobic dominance of the &#960;&#8208;surface in water, leading to undesired kinetic traps. This study reveals the pathway complexity in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated supramolecular polymerization of an amide&#8208;functionalized naphthalene monoimide (NMI) building block with a hydrophilic oligo&#8208;oxyethylene (OE) wedge. O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 initially produced entropically driven, collapsed spherical particles in water (Agg&#8208;1); however, over a span of 72&#8197;h, these metastable Agg&#8208;1 gradually transformed into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (Agg&#8208;2), favoured by both entropy and enthalpy contributions. The intricate self&#8208;assembly pathways in O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 enable us to explore seed&#8208;induced living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) in water for controlled synthesis of monolayered 2D assemblies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nonspecific surface adsorption of a model enzyme, serine protease &#945;&#8208;Chymotrypsin (&#945;&#8208;ChT), and consequently the enzyme activity, which could be regulated by controlling the morphological transformation of O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 from Agg&#8208;1 to Agg&#8208;2. We delve into the thermodynamic aspects of such shape&#8208;dependent protein&#8208;surface interactions and unravel the impact of seed&#8208;induced LSP on temporally controlling the catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;ChT.

         <title>Regulating Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Weakly Solvating Electrolyte towards Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weakly solvating electrolyte is formulated with 2 &#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran to decrease the ion&#8208;dipole interactions. Its anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures facilitate stable sodium storage in hard carbon anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The full cell paired with NVP cathode operates over 250 stable cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra&#8208;low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion&#8208;dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+&#8208;dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic&#8208;rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of &#8722;83.3&#8201;&#176;C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40 and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work sheds new lights on the ion&#8208;dipole regulation for ultra&#8208;low temperature SIBs.

Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion-dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra-low temperatures. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and solvents. The reduced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion-enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic-rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of &#8722;83.3&#8201;&#176;C and faster Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;40 and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work sheds new lights on the ion-dipole regulation for ultra-low temperature SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor, GS70, is synthesized by incorporating 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as a &#960;&#8208;bridge, aiming to reduce material costs and enhance stability. The obtained active layers exhibit favorable morphology and effectively suppress charge recombination. Encouragingly, this design leads to the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and stable single&#8208;junction and parallel tandem OSCs.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenges, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4&#8201;%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9&#8201;% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr Cross&#8208;Interfacial Electron Bridges to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off for Superdurable Bifunctional Single Atom Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>

A cross&#8208;interfacial electronic bridges (CIEBs) is constructed via interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#9653;E=0.70&#8197;V) and breakthrough durability including 100&#8201;% current retention after 10&#8197;h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of grafting PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; onto ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys achieved the effects of three birds with one stone: improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface, increased the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, and mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic environments.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.

In this study, aromatic&#8208;core engineering was conducted on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core to precisely regulate the geometry of tethered dimeric acceptors, revealing a more advantageous molecular packing for the meta&#8208;positioned dimers. This finding led to the design of a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned trimer, demonstrating enhanced device stability and performance.







Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA&#8208;subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core and find that meta&#8208;positioned dimeric BDY&#8208;&#946; exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para&#8208;positioned counterpart, BDY&#8208;&#945;. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;, maintaining a meta&#8208;position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24&#8201;%, coupled with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1200&#8197;h thermal degradation. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of tethered trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value in PSCs, simultaneously improving in device efficiency and thermal stability.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spidroin&#8208;derived modular proteins have been designed and the fabricated fibers demonstrate a toughness of up to 200&#8197;MJ/m3, achieving the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. By co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch stability have been improved significantly.







Abstract
Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.

         <title>Highly Stable Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries via Regulated Photo&#8208;Induced Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light can significantly improve the performance of batteries. However, zinc ion battery often exhibits poor cycling life under illumination, which limits its application and the mechanism is still ambiguous. This work demonstrates integrated photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high cyclic stability of 4000 cycles, extending the previous record by one order of magnitude through the discovery and optimization of a photo&#8208;induced proton transfer.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries utilize light to boost capacity but face cycling instability due to complex charge/ion transfer under illumination. This study identified photo&#8208;induced proton transfer (photo&#8208;induced PT) as a significant process in photo&#8208;(dis)charging of widely&#8208;used V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries, contributing to enhanced capacity under illumination but jeopardizing photo&#8208;stability. Photo&#8208;induced PT occurs at 100&#8197;ps after photo&#8208;excitation, inducing rapid proton extraction into V2O5 photoelectrode. This process creates a proton&#8208;deficient microenvironment on surface, leading to repetitive cathode dissolution and anode corrosion in each cycle. Enabling the intercalated protons from photo&#8208;induced PT to be reversibly employed in charge&#8208;discharge processes via the anode&#8208;alloying strategy achieves high photo&#8208;stability for the battery. Consequently, a ~54&#8201;% capacity enhancement was achieved in a V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion battery under illumination, with ~90&#8201;% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This extends the photo&#8208;stability record by 10&#8197;times. This study offers promising advancements in energy storage by addressing instability issues in photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries.

         <title>Bridging of Cove Regions: A Strategy for Realizing Persistently Chiral Double Heterohelicenes with Attractive Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through bridging the cove regions of a double helicene, chiral compounds featuring a small 3D cavity have been synthesized. The structural features endow these compounds with persistent chirality. Moreover, the introduced bridging groups result in attractive luminescent properties, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The racemization of chiral organic compounds is a common chemical phenomenon. However, it often poses configurational&#8208;stability issues to the application of this class of compounds. Achieving chiral organic compounds without the risk of racemization is fascinating, but it is challenging due to a lack of strategies. Here, we reveal the cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy for achieving persistently chiral multi&#8208;helicenes (incapable of racemization), based on the synthesized proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept double hetero[4]helicenes featuring macrocycle structures with a small 3D cavity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the strategy is also effective in tuning the electronic structures of multi&#8208;helicenes, resulting in a conversion from luminescence silence into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for the present system. Furthermore, red circularly polarized TADF based on small double [4]helicene systems is achieved for the first time using this strategy. The disclosed cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy provides an opportunity to modulate the electronic structures and luminescent properties of multi&#8208;helicenes without concern for racemization, thus significantly enhancing the structural and property diversity of multi&#8208;helicenes for various applications.

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Dependent Labeling of Organelles with a Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Phosphorus&#8208;Bridged Rhodamine Dye in Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes bearing a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group were developed for labeling organelles of interest. The stereoisomers, arising from restricted rotation between the xanthene skeleton and the thiophene ring, showed distinct staining performance. One isomer selectively labeled HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins in cells, while the other isomer exhibited non&#8208;specific accumulation on organelle membranes, where dyes aggregated within the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting cis and trans isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the cis isomer showed non&#8208;specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the trans isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins, enabling the long&#8208;term imaging of cell division and the 5&#8208;color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the cis isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the trans isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the trans isomer and its NIR&#8208;emissive properties, multi&#8208;color time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution 3D imaging, namely super&#8208;resolution 5D&#8208;imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.

&lt;p&gt;Phospha-rhodamine (POR) dyes bearing a 2-carboxy-3-benzothiophenyl group were developed for labeling organelles of interest. The stereoisomers, arising from restricted rotation between the xanthene skeleton and the thiophene ring, showed distinct staining performance. One isomer selectively labeled HaloTag-fused proteins in cells, while the other isomer exhibited non-specific accumulation on organelle membranes, where dyes aggregated within the lipid bilayer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha-rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2-carboxy-3-benzothiophenyl group at the 9-position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X-ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer showed non-specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag-fused proteins, enabling the long-term imaging of cell division and the 5-color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer and its NIR-emissive properties, multi-color time-lapse super-resolution 3D imaging, namely super-resolution 5D-imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multisite Fine&#8208;Tuning in Hybrid Cadmium Halides Enables Wide Range Emissions for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale spectral regulation was demonstrated in a single matrix of [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) via multisite fine&#8208;tuning strategy, and the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions were established for multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiple information storage through simply excitation changing.







Abstract
Achieving tunable emissions spanning the spectrum, from blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, within a single component is a formidable challenge with significant implication, particularly in tailoring multicolor luminescence for anti&#8208;counterfeiting purposes. In this study, we demonstrate a broad spectrum of emissions, covering blue to red and extending into NIR light in [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) through precise multisite structural fine&#8208;tuning. Notably, the multicolor emissions from [BPy]2CdBr4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ manifest a distinctive pattern, transitioning from blue to yellow in tandem with the host [BPy]2CdBr4 and further extending from yellow to NIR with its homologous [BPy]2CdCl4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+, resulting in the simultaneous presence of intersecting and independent emission colors. Detailed modulation of chemical composition enables partial luminescence switching, facilitating the creation of diverse patterns with multicolor luminescence by employing [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ as phosphors. This study for the first time successfully implements several groups of tunable emission colors in a single matrix via multisite fine&#8208;tuning. Such an effective strategy not only develops the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions, but also introduces a cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approach to achieving unique, high&#8208;level, plentiful&#8208;color and multiple&#8208;information&#8208;storage labels for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles, and Fe&#8722;CeO2 nanoparticles in an active multicomponent ensemble has been unraveled with the capacity to simultaneously enhance ORR activity (a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.948&#8197;V vs. RHE) and durability (negligible loss after 50k&#8197;cycles) in alkaline. Density functional theory and machine learning reveal the necessary electronic interactions (&#1013;d, Wf, &#956;B, Q) and geometric interactions (d and dFe&#8722;N) in a collective effect.







Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851&#8197;VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.

         <title>A Ferroptosis&#8208;Inducing Arsenene&#8208;Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an innovative arsenene&#8208;iridium nanoplatform AsIr@PDA by loading ferroptosis&#8208;inducing metal complex IrFN on arsenene nanosheets. The effective release of IrFN from AsIr@PDA induced pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis, and the ferroptotic cell death together with the immunomodulatory arsenene endows AsIr@PDA with a superior therapeutic effect by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy.







Abstract
Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (AsIr@PDA) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (IrFN) onto two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets. This nanoplatform exhibits superior ferroptosis&#8208;inducing effects with high drug loading capacity and, importantly, excellent anti&#8208;cancer immune activation function, leading to efficient elimination of pancreatic tumors with no observable side effects. Interestingly, AsIr@PDA significantly prevents the recurrence of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with a cisplatin&#8208;loaded nanoplatform. This designed nanoplatform demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy with immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, providing new insights for future pancreatic cancer therapy.

Inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) were synthesized as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS production even than the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.

         <title>Spaced Double Hydrogen Bonding in an Imidazole Poly Ionic Liquid Composite for Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Air Reductive H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spaced double hydrogen bonds in an imidazole poly ionic liquid surface can change the active site from being a covered state to a fully exposed one. This results in a more positive potential and more efficient orbital binding patterns giving better active sites for the selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23&#8197;times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) was designed and synthesized using the &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy. Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a large SHG (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap of 2.45&#8197;eV, a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm), a broad IR transparent region (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m) as well as the congruent&#8208;melting behavior, which indicate that it is a promising IR NLO material.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45&#8197;eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <title>A Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst [Co2O2] Metallacycle Enables Regioselective Allene C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy chemistry fuels the development of synthetic chemistry. Structurally well&#8208;defined [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes are developed as robust hydrogen evolution catalysts, unlocking the regioselective allene C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization. A broad range of simple allenes are readily upgraded to synthetically useful allenols with unconventional chemoselectivity, high regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance, and mild conditions.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H is an ideal approach to upgrading simple allenes to synthetically useful allenes, albeit suffering from challenges associated with inert reactivity and inferior selectivity. Inspired by energy chemistry, a catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy was leveraged to selectively activate weakly acidic allene C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds in a reductive mode. An array of [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes were readily devised starting from amino acids, and they were demonstrated as robust HER catalysts, which would selectively break allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds to release hydrogen. With the newly developed HER catalyst, regioselective electrochemical functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H with alcoholic &#945; C(sp3)&#8208;H was unprecedentedly achieved. This strategy features excellent regioselectivity, unconventional chemoselectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance (62 examples), and mild conditions. Mechanism experiments revealed a reactive hydroxy&#8208;coordinated cobalt(II) species in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to rationalize the regioselectivity observed in the reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective functionalization of allenic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H is an ideal approach to upgrading simple allenes to synthetically useful allenes, albeit suffering from challenges associated with inert reactivity and inferior selectivity. Inspired by energy chemistry, a catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy was leveraged to selectively activate weakly acidic allene C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bonds in a reductive mode. An array of [Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] metallacycle complexes were readily devised starting from amino acids, and they were demonstrated as robust HER catalysts, which would selectively break allenic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bonds to release hydrogen. With the newly developed HER catalyst, regioselective electrochemical functionalization of allenic C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H with alcoholic &#945; C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H was unprecedentedly achieved. This strategy features excellent regioselectivity, unconventional chemoselectivity, good functional-group tolerance (62 examples), and mild conditions. Mechanism experiments revealed a reactive hydroxy-coordinated cobalt(II) species in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to rationalize the regioselectivity observed in the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral self&#8208;assembled cage constructed from the truxene framework dimerizes in solution thanks to favourable geometric and electronic parameters. The interlocked dimer can be dissociated upon forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex in the presence of a guest. The chiral cavity induces chirality in the achiral guest molecule, as characterized by circular dichroism measurements.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8211;guest systems currently attracts much attention because of the major impact such structures may have in a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4&#8197;&#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by the addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the planar achiral molecule exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, thus demonstrating the ability of the cage to induce supramolecular chirogenesis.

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the property and amorphous structural was studied. Distorted metal nodes in amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks affect the electronic structure with downshifted conduction band (CB) potential, which facilitates the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process and O2 activation. Amorphous material displays a better photocatalytic activity of toluene oxidation than crystalline one (2.45&#8197;times).







Abstract
Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Increasing the Accessibility of Internal Catalytic Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks by Introducing a Bicontinuous Mesostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure were synthesized through a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided nanocasting method. The bicontinuous architecture enables efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal regions of the COFs, leading to high accessibility of their active catalytic sites and excellent NO removal capability.







Abstract
Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly&#8208;guided nanocasting strategy. Three different mesostructured COFs are synthesized, including two covalent triazine frameworks and one vinylene&#8208;linked COF. The new materials are endowed with a hierarchical meso/microporous architecture, in which the mesochannels exhibit an ordered shifted double diamond (SDD) topology. The hierarchically porous structure can enable efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal of the COFs and consequently high accessibility of their active catalytic sites. Benefiting from this hierarchical structure, these COFs exhibit excellent performance in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic NO removal with a high conversion percentage of up to 51.4&#8201;%, placing them one of the top reported NO&#8208;elimination photocatalysts. This study represents the first case of introducing a bicontinuous structure into COFs, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of hierarchically porous COFs and for increasing the utilization degree of their internal active sites.

         <title>12 Connecting Sites Linked Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Non&#8208;interpenetrated shp Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented 12 connecting sites linked three&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with intrinsic non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology have been fabricated and structurally characterized, which show efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O.







Abstract
Developing high connectivity (&gt;8) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards new topologies and functions remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in getting high connectivity organic building blocks. This however represents the most important step towards promoting the diversity of COFs due to the still limited dynamic covalent bonds available for constructing COFs at this stage. Herein, highly connected phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) 3D COFs MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs (M=H2, Ni) were afforded from the reaction between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine M(TAPc) (M=H2, Ni) and 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexayl)hexa(isophthalohydrazide) (THHI) with 12 connecting sites. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis together with theoretical simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveals their crystalline nature with an unprecedented non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology. Experimental and theoretical investigations disclose the broadened visible light absorption range and narrow optical band gap of MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs. This in combination with their 3D nanochannels endows them with efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O via 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm). This work provides valuable result for the development of high connectivity functional COFs towards diverse application potentials.

Developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate traditional photodynamic theranostics. Herein, we innovatively propose an acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer strategy toward facilitating the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs of photosensitizers for amplifying oxygen&#8208;independent photodynamic oncotherapy.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) caused by the inherent oxygen consumption of traditional Type&#8208;II PDT and anoxic tumor microenvironment. The challenge for the exploration of Type&#8208;I PSs is to facilitate the electron transfer ability of photosensitization molecules for transforming oxygen or H2O to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we propose an electronic acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer (a&#8208;PET) strategy promoting the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs by marriage of two organic semiconducting molecules of a non&#8208;fullerene scaffold&#8208;based photosensitizer and a perylene diimide that significantly boost the Type&#8208;I PDT pathway to produce plentiful ROS, especially, inducing 3.5&#8208;fold and 2.5&#8208;fold amplification of hydroxyl (OH&#8901;) and superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation. Systematic mechanism exploration reveals that intermolecular electron transfer and intramolecular charge separation after photoirradiation generate a competent production of radical ion pairs that promote the Type&#8208;I PDT process by theoretical calculation and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. By complementary tumor diagnosis with photoacoustic imaging and second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, this as&#8208;prepared nanoplatform exhibits fabulous photocytotoxicity in harsh hypoxic conditions and terrific cancer revoked abilities in living mice. We envision that this work will broaden the insight into high&#8208;efficiency Type&#8208;I PDT for cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Tailored Polymer Molecular Weights for Specific Photovoltaic Applications through Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Simultaneous Physical and Chemical Events</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted polymerization is useful method to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymer with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers molecular weights with high reproducibility.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric strategy to regulate the electron environment of active sites of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts via dangling thiophene units inside and outside COF rings is reported. The isomeric COF&#8208;&#946; with exposed active sites and localized charges show high activity, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites.







Abstract
With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with promising geometry construction.

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

The extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K was achieved by the Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy in outer space, inducing surface nucleation and rapid solidification. High spherical alloy droplets assure precise determination of liquid properties. High&#8208;temperature liquid&#8216;s chemical bonds and atomic structures were revealed.







Abstract
The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8722;Si and Zr&#8722;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2338&#8197;K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.

Indigo , an ancient, plant&#8208;derived fabric dye, can be used to make Fe coordination polymers on silver surfaces as reported by Biao Yang, Joachim Reichert, Shobhana Narasimhan, Johannes&#8197;V. Barth, Anthoula&#8197;C. Papageorgiou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202319162). Within such coordination polymers on the close&#8208;packed silver surface, thermally activated switches from trans to cis indigo are triggered and result in isomeric indigo&#8208;Fe coordination polymers.

Selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry creates seleno&#8208;connecting linkage to efficiently explore the organo&#8208;Se chemical world. In their Research Article (e202318534), Wei Hou, Hongtao Xu et&#8197;al. put forward the concept of SeNEx chemistry based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. This reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics, and can be used in nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein bioconjugation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

We outline the recent progress on bulk and thin&#8208;film metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the context of their electrical properties and related electronic device configurations. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the electrical conductivity of MOFs are emphasized.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8722;7&#8211;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface&#8208;anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs&#8208;based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs&#8208;based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) have emerged as highly promising dual&#8208;functional enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts that can initiate the photochemical transformations and achieve distinctive selectivities with multiple noncovalent host&#8211;guest interactions as control forces. This review summaries recent advances of organic transformation using PMOCs as supramolecular reactors through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) processes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8211;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D/A heterojunction photosensitizers, composed of organic photovoltaic electron donors and acceptors, have been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions and demonstrated an exciting solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. The confronted challenges and possible opportunities are indicated with the aim of boosting research on organic D/A heterojunction photosensitizers further.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950&#8197;nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly evolving field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalysis encompasses various processes, ranging from green NH3 synthesis and the construction of C&#8722;N bonds with small molecules to the synthesis of nitrogenous compounds with unconventional oxidation states. The review aims to provide insights into recent progress, research methodologies, and prospective avenues for the regulated generation and in situ utilization of nitrogenous intermediates.







Abstract
Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Multifold Post&#8208;Modification of Macrocycles and Cages by Isocyanate&#8208;Induced Azadefluorination Cyclisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents through azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC), which enables multistep supramolecular chemistry using readily available isocyanates, allowing the functionalization of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages&#8242; exterior chemical spaces. With ditopic isocyanates, ADFC can be used to create cross&#8208;linked membranes from supramolecular entities.







Abstract
We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif via an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.

         <title>The Retaining Pse5Ac7Ac Pseudaminyltransferase KpsS1 Defines a Previously Unreported glycosyltransferase family (GT118)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pse5Ac7Ac glycosyltransferase (GT) activity has been demonstrated in characterisation of the retaining pseudaminyltransferase (PseT) KpsS1, the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118). KpsS1 is utilised in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of a glycoside terminating in Pse5Ac7Ac, an important bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid Neu5Ac.







Abstract
Cell surface sugar 5,7&#8208;diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that A.&#8197;baumannii KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac&#8208;&#945;(2,6)&#8208;Glcp linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118).

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of S&#8722;Si Reagents by Silylium Ions for Their Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Addition Across C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ&#8208;generated bissilylated sulfonium ion is the actual catalyst in highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective addition reactions of thiosilanes across the C&#8722;C multiple bonds of alkynes and allenes, respectively (see scheme). These thiosilylation reactions enable the direct installation of two orthogonal linchpins for further chemoselective functional&#8208;group manipulation.







Abstract
A regioselective silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;promoted thiosilylation of internal C&#8722;C triple bonds with control over the double bond geometry is described. Both a C(sp2)&#8722;S and a C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond are formed with a trans relationship in this two&#8208;component reaction of an alkyne and a thiosilane. The resulting orthogonally functionalized C&#8722;C double bond can be chemoselectively defunctionalized or further processed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions with the alkene configuration retained. The procedure is also applicable to the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiosilylation of terminal allenes to arrive at allylic thioethers containing a vinylsilane unit. These reactions involve the electrophilic activation of the S&#8722;Si reagent, both a silylated thiophenol and even alkylthiol derivative, by an in situ&#8208;generated carbocation intermediate. The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl&#8208; or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction are also reported.

         <title>Fluorinated MOF&#8208;Based Hexafluoropropylene Nanotrap for Highly Efficient Purification of Octafluoropropane Electronic Specialty Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed fluoridated pore engineering strategy endows a cage&#8208;like MOF with molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation and highly efficient purification of C3F8 electronic specialty gas. Moreover, hydrophobic microenvironments generated by fluoridation groups significantly boost the chemical stability of MOF.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc=5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8722;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained.

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, is reported. The cation&#8208;anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li3MX6 family. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.







Abstract
The Li3MX6 compounds (M=Sc, Y, In; X=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure &#945;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.
