         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct bandgap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, although the development of GDY in photocatalysis is far behind. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable bandgap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely review will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8209;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8209;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8208;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8208;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing the Elusive "In&#8208;Between" State of the Copper&#8208;Amyloid&#946; Complex by X&#8208;ray Absorption through Partial Thermal Relaxation after Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox activity of Cu ions bound to the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is implicated as a source of oxidative stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. In order to explain the efficient redox cycling between Cu(II)&#8208;A&#946; (distorted square pyramidal) and Cu(I)&#8208;A&#946; (digonal) resting states, the existence of a low&#8208;populated "in&#8208;between" state, prone to bind Cu in both oxidation states, has been postulated. Here, we exploited the partial X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction at 10 K, followed by a thermal relaxation at 200 K, to trap and characterize by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) a partially reduced Cu&#8208;A&#946;1&#8722;16 species different from the resting states. Remarkably, the XAS spectrum is well&#8208;fitted by a previously proposed model of the "in&#8208;between" state, hence providing the first direct spectroscopic characterization of this intermediate state. The present approach could be used to explore and identify the catalytic intermediates of other relevant metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitutedpiperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in&#8208;situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. The chirality memory mainly has been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality by noncovalent interactions is erased by changing conditions such as solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted to static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups using covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbons at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion dependent on guest solvent chain length. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore,&#160;diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene&#160;The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95%de).</dc:description>

         <title>Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8 on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals were uniformly grown on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to give a hybrid material, ZIF@CNCs. By varying the stoichiometry of the components, it was possible to control the size of the ZIF&#8208;8 crystals grown on the CNC surface. Optimized ZIF@CNC (ZIF@CNC&#8208;2) was used as a template to synthesize a microporous organic polymer (MOP), ZIF@MOP@CNC. After etching the ZIF&#8208;8 with 6 M HCl solution, a MOP material with encapsulated CNCs (MOP@CNC) was formed. Zinc coordination into the porphyrin unit of the MOP yielded the ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure, Zn MOP@CNC, comprised of CNCs encapsulated within the Zn&#8208;MOP. In comparison to ZIF@CNC&#8208;2, Zn MOP@CNC showed better catalytic activity and chemical stability for CO2 fixation, converting epichlorohydrin to chloroethylene carbonate. This work demonstrates a novel approach to create porous materials through CNC templating.</dc:description>

         <title>A polarized gel electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) has attracted broad attention in the field of portable and wearable electronic devices. Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with the Zn anode and adapt to the severe climates at high and ultralow temperatures. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain a large amount of polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; functional groups. The polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; groups forms an electrical field at the interface of gel electrolyte and Zn anode to uniformize the Zn2+ transport and suppress the formation of Zn dendrites. Besides, the polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; terminal groups in PAM&#8208;SC can fix numerous water molecules in the gel electrolyte, which prevents the water from freezing at ultralow temperatures and evaporating at high temperatures. The polarized PAM&#8208;SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68 mS cm&#8208;1 and water retention of 96.85% after being exposed to air for 96 h. FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit a long cycling life of 700 cycles at a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#8451;, showing the application prospect of FZABs under extreme conditions.</dc:description>

In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide-sodium citric (PAM-SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain a large amount of polarized -COO- functional groups. The polarized -COO- groups forms an electrical field at the interface of gel electrolyte and Zn anode to uniformize the Zn2+ transport and suppress the formation of Zn dendrites. Besides, the polarized -COO- terminal groups in PAM-SC can fix numerous water molecules in the gel electrolyte, which prevents the water from freezing at ultralow temperatures and evaporating at high temperatures. The polarized PAM-SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68 mS cm-1 and water retention of 96.85% after being exposed to air for 96 h.

         <dc:description>Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8208;B&#8208;N) MR unit into traditional N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8208;B&#8208;N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8208;B&#8208;N, symmetric N&#8208;B&#8208;N and extended O&#8208;B&#8208;N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8208;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high PLQY of 93% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26 nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunableTransition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the bandgap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.</dc:description>

         <title>Defective Organic Cations and Their in&#8208;Framework Dynamics on Properties of ASnI3 (A = FA or MA) Perovskites: Why FA Yield Higher Photovoltaic Performance than MA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA (HC(NH2)2) in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8211;15 cm3 s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11 cm3 s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear and Bent Cp*2Si: Reversable Phase Transition of a Key Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TThe solid&#8208;state structure of decamethylsilicocene Cp*2Si with a bent and a linear molecule in the same unit cell was so far considered an exception in relation to the structures of its all&#8208;bent heavier analogues Cp*2E with E=Ge, Sn, Pb. Here, we present the solution to this conundrum by reporting a low&#8208;temperature phase, where all three symmetrically independent molecules are present in a bent formation. This reversible enantiotropic phase transition occurs in the temperature range between 80 K and 130 K and provides a rationale for the unexpected linear molecule based in entropy beyond hand&#8208;waving explanations such as electronic reasons or packing effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Here, we report the first, modular and orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis of tridecasaccharide 1 from Bacteroides vulgates based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycosides&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also featured the followings: (1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene group directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; (2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; (3) remote anchimeric assistance effect for stereoselective assembly of &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; (4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis and strategic uses of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharides assembly; (5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target 1</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton localization is a conventional approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing a strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA = octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to ~64%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, i.e., four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7'&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6'&#8208; and TdaO for C7'&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of twenty&#8208;five novel ETPs, including twenty shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuities of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8211;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1mol % to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3% was obtained at 300&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in&#8208;situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8210;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve catalytic activity and product selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate spin state of catalytic centers for their fixed electronic configurations at room temperature. Herein, we report a facile mechanical exfoliation strategy to in&#8208;situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s = 5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s = 1/2) of the ferric center across the lattice. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7 mmol g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in increasing orbital overlap, significantly promoting CO2 selective adsorption and reducing its activation barrier. Hence, the facile spin manipulation through mechanical exfoliation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Asymmetric Structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;promoted Selective and Efficient Gold Extraction and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04 g/g under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach has been developed to realize deacylative thiolation of common ketones, which provides a unique method to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring acceptors for organic solar cells are presented in this Review from the viewpoint of materials design. The cencepts of noncovalent interactions, insertion of sterically hindered side chains, and planarization of the molecular backbone by conformational locking are summarized toward the design of high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA). In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16&#8201;%, yet lower than the 19&#8201;% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.

         <title>ECNU&#8208;13: A High&#8208;Silica Zeolite with Three&#8208;Dimensional and High&#8208;Connectivity Multi&#8208;Pore Structures for Selective Alkene Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;silica zeolite skeleton, ECNU&#8208;13, was designed and synthesized by a phase&#8208;discrimination strategy. The crystallization process was directed by the regulation of single four&#8208;membered ring (s4r) units to give rise to two kinds of polymorphs with tridimensional high&#8208;connectivity multi&#8208;pore systems. The ECNU&#8208;13 zeolite demonstrated high propene selectivity in cracking of 1&#8208;butene, with minimized formation of aromatics.







Abstract
A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al=23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6&#8201;%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt;4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.

         <title>Peptide Bond Formation in the Protonated Serine Dimer Following Vacuum UV Photon&#8208;Induced Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While collision induced dissociation of protonated serine dimers leads only to cluster breakup, clear evidence that irradiation by Vacuum UV (PID) light leads to intra&#8208;cluster bond formation is presented. Furthermore, comparison with the PID of serine dipeptides suggests that peptide bond formation is involved in the process.







Abstract
Possible routes for intra&#8208;cluster bond formation (ICBF) in protonated serine dimers have been studied. We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the 4.6&#8211;14&#8197;eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon&#8208;induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by ab initio molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unraveling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.

         <title>Directional Transformation of Heterometallic Oxo Clusters: A New Approach to Prepare Wide&#8208;Bandgap Cathode Interlayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the directional preparation of PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination.

Typical wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by S&#8208;containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO2. By in situ heating, the cluster is transformed into PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure. The oxygen atoms from sulfate ion in heterostructure connect with iodine from perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. While the yielded metallic interface between PbSO4 and PbTi3O7 promotes the electron transport across the interface. Finally, an efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is obtained. The heterostructure well&#8208;stabilize the interface of perovskite and SnO2, to greatly improve the device stability. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer by directional transformation of heterometallic oxo clusters.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;atomic metal could render highly active Co3+ centers exposed through the electron promoter effect and also separate the active sites, thereby regulating the morphology of Li2O2 to elevated performances of Li&#8208;oxygen battery. We found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Li&#8208;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M=Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The single&#8208;atomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Intermolecular Charge Separation of Cationic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high contrast to other dimerization modes of ionic radicals, the cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ demonstrates unparalleled spontaneous symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation, generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Such a unique phenomenon sheds new light on fundamental concepts and uncharted material science.







Abstract
A quadrupolar compound Pyr&#8208;BA with two pyrrole&#8208;type nitrogen atoms doped externally was prepared in this work. In high contrast with other &#960; ionic radicals, its cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ undergoes unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) single&#8208;crystal analysis, absorption and EPR experiments all confirmed that aggregation and lower temperature would help to facilitate this SB&#8208;CS process. Gibbs energy calculations and gauge&#8208;including magnetically induced current simulation both validate that, for Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+, SB&#8208;CS behavior is more favorable than the conventional dimerization mode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows solid single&#8208;crystal evidence for spontaneous SB&#8208;CS between identical ionic radicals. Such a unique phenomenon is of great significance both in terms of fundamental aspects and uncharted material science.

         <title>Spatial Localization of Two Enzymes at Pickering Emulsion Droplet Interfaces for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different enzymes were precisely localized at the inner and outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets with the aid of an asymmetrically modified mesoporous nanosheet. This unique system exhibited significantly enhanced cascading efficiency in oxidation reactions by creating reaction microenvironments appropriate for the different enzymes and enabling efficient intermediate transportation at the droplet interfaces.







Abstract
Developing biocatalytic cascades in abiological conditions is of utmost significance, but such processes often suffer from low reaction efficiency because of incompatible reaction environments and suppressed intermediate transportation. Herein we report a new type of biocatalytic cascade by localizing two different enzymes separately in the outer and inner interfacial layers of Pickering emulsion droplets. This versatile approach enables the localization of two enzymes in their preferred reaction microenvironments and simultaneously in nanoscale proximity of each other. The thus&#8208;designed interfacial biocatalytic cascades show outstanding catalytic efficiency in alkene epoxidation and thioether oxidation with in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, 6.9&#8211;13.6 times higher than the catalytic efficiency of the free enzymes in solution and their multi&#8208;enzymatic counterparts. The remarkable interfacial effect of Pickering droplets was found to be responsible for the significantly enhanced cascading efficiency.

A novel concept of a &#8220;Zn&#8208;organic battery&#8221; and a Cu nanosheet/Cu foil electrocatalyst were presented for the simultaneous efficient energy delivery and semi&#8208;hydrogenation of biomass aldehyde derivatives, achieving an impressive electrochemical performance of 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum power density and 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum current density.







Abstract
Electricity generation and chemical productions are both critically important for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Here, a novel bifunctional Zn&#8208;organic battery has been established for the concurrent enhanced electricity output and semi&#8208;hydrogenations of a series of biomass aldehyderivatives, for the high value&#8208;added chemical syntheses. Among them, the typical Zn&#8208;furfural (FF) battery equipped with Cu foil&#8208;supported edge&#8208;enriched Cu nanosheets as cathodic electrocatalyst (Cu NS/Cu foil), provides a maximum current density and power density of 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and in the meantime, produces high value product, furfural alcohol (FAL). The Cu NS/Cu foil catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance of &#8776;93.5&#8201;% conversion ratio and &#8776;93.1&#8201;% selectivity for FF semi&#8208;hydrogenation at a low potential of &#8208;1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using H2O as H source, and shows impressive performance for various biomass aldehyderivatives semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First examples of anionic cAACs (Ani&#8208;cAACs) bearing B(CN)3 or C2F5BF2 as N&#8208;substituents are reported and their stereo&#8208;electronic parameters have been evaluated. These anionic carbenes can replace anionic substituents as exemplified by the formation of selenium adducts and [Ani&#8208;cAAC&#8208;Au&#8208;PPh3].







Abstract
First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC 6 was obtained in high yield on a multigram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental selenium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the anionic selenium adducts 7 and 8 and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex 9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.

         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8722;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional Fe&#8722;Se atom pair electrocatalyst shows a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance, and the Fe&#8722;Se/NC based cable&#8208;structure Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver an ultra&#8208;high cycling performance of 741&#8197;h @1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negligible activity delay at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which mainly attributes to the synergistic interactions of Fe and Se sites.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully construct bifunctional electrocatalysts by synthesizing atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8722;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698&#8197;V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs leads to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8722;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200&#8197;h (1090&#8197;cycles) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is 6.9&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC displays an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741&#8197;h (4041&#8197;cycles) at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is about 11.7&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC could be operated for 133&#8197;h (725&#8197;cycles) even at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bilayer nanographene (EP9H) containing a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized with an extended &#960;&#8208;system perpendicular to the helical axis of [9]helicene. Furthermore, the structure extension induced significant improvements in the fluorescence quantum yield and circularly polarized luminescence, as evident from the large glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
A novel chiral nanographene (i.e. EP9H) with a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirms the helical structure. The fluorescence emission of EP9H is located in the near infrared region (&#955;em=684&#8197;nm) with a medium quantum yield (0.10) for helicene derivatives. Cyclic voltammetry reveals its seven quasi&#8208;reversible redox states from &#8722;2 to +5. Furthermore, enantiopure EP9H displays distinct CD signals in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700&#8197;nm. Notably, compared to the reported small organic molecules, EP9H displays an outstanding |glum| value of 4.50&#215;10&#8722;2 and BCPL as 304&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of molecules displaying an inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states has been identified through computational screening of synthesized structures. This observed behavior is attributed to a high&#8208;symmetry pentalene core motif, which is stabilized via aromaticity.







Abstract
Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund's rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.







Abstract
Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.

     alt="Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF-67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF-67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF-67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF-67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF-67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF-67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanostructuring of Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Long&#8208;range Ordered Arrays in the Framework of Organic Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first compound with long&#8208;range ordered single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) encapsulated in protective framework was synthesized and its structure and magnetic properties were investigated. The findings provide a method to control the nanostructuring of SMM within protective frameworks and further the development of molecular spintronics.







Abstract
The nanostructuring of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) on substrates, in nanotubes and periodic frameworks is highly desired for the future magnetic recording devices. However, the ability to organize SMMs into long&#8208;range ordered arrays in these systems is still lacking. Here, we report the incorporation of magnetic (RECl2(H2O)6)+ (RE=rare earths) molecular groups into the framework of an organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP)&#8212;(H2dabco)CsCl3. Intriguingly, we show the incorporated rare&#8208;earth groups self&#8208;organized into long&#8208;range ordered arrays that uniformly and periodically distributed in the A sites of OMHP. The ordered (RECl2(H2O)6)+ groups serve as SMMs in the perovskite frameworks, exhibiting large effective magnetic moment, moderate magnetic anisotropy and two&#8208;step relaxation behavior. With the additional merit of great structural flexibility and multifunction of OMHPs, the preparation of the first SMMs@OMHP magnetic materials furthers the development of molecular spintronics.

         <title>Stable Ketenyl Anions via Ligand Exchange at an Anionic Carbon as Powerful Synthons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt (1) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving a (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt (2). Reactivity investigations showed that the ketenyl anion can be a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.







Abstract
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO), a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CN2][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)] (1) ([P]=[(CH2)(NDipp)]2P; 18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving the (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (2). Oxidation of 2 with elemental Se affords the (selenophosphoryl)ketenyl anion salt [P](Se)&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (3). These ketenyl anions feature a strongly bent geometry at the P&#8208;bound carbon and this carbon atom is highly nucleophilic. The electronic structure of the ketenyl anion [[P]&#8208;CCO]&#8722; of 2 is examined by theoretical studies. Reactivity investigations demonstrate 2 as a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy was created by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based HCR and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. The ARMOR can shield cells from external assaults and enhance the survival rate of the protected cells in an unfavorable environment. The ARMOR&#8208;based cell capture strategy can obtain more intact genetic information and provide a new method for clinical CTC analysis.







Abstract
Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are one of the most intriguing electrocatalysts with maximized material efficiency. For their viable applications in industries, the next challenge is ensuring their long&#8208;term stability. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding the operational stability of SACs and provides an outlook for their future developments.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;Doped Chiral Molecular Belts of the Zigzag&#8208;Type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy has been used to synthesize depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |glum| up to 0.022.







Abstract
Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt.

The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a two-directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth-expanded oxygen-doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag-type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3-dihydro-1H-phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring-closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O-doped C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&lt;b&gt;&#956;&lt;/b&gt;) and magnetic (&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt-derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Solvated Double&#8208;Layer Polymer Electrolytes with Molecular Interactions Mediated Stable Interfaces for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte and/or anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in polymer&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) will deteriorate their cycle performance. Herein, a unique solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SDL&#8208;QSPE) with high Na+ ion conductivity is designed to simultaneously improve stability on both cathode and anode sides. Different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizers to improve Na+ conductivity and thermal stability. The SDL&#8208;QSPE is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolyte to meet the independent interfacial requirements of the two electrodes. The interfacial evolution is elucidated by theoretical calculations and 3D X&#8208;ray microtomography analysis. The Na0.67Mn2/3Ni1/3O2|SDL&#8208;QSPE|Na batteries exhibit 80.4 mAh g&#8208;1 after 400 cycles at 1 C with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100%, which significantly outperforms those batteries using the monolayer&#8208;structured QSPE.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Local Lattice Distortion for Spectrally Stable and Efficient Mixed&#8208;halide Blue Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites are considered the most straightforward candidates to realize blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, they suffer severe halide migration, leading to spectral instability, which is particularly exaggerated in high chloride alloying perovskites. Here, we demonstrate energy barrier of halide migration can be tuned by manipulating the degree of local lattice distortion (LLD). Enlarging the LLD degree to a suitable level can increase the halide migration energy barrier. We herein report an &#8216;A&#8208;site&#8217; cation engineering to tune the LLD degree to an optimal level. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that LLD manipulation suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Conclusively, mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLEDs with a champion EQE of 14.2% at 475 nm have been achieved. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent operational spectral stability (T50 of 72 min), representing one of the most efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry&#160;for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly&#160;polarized photodetectors&#160;require chiral light absorption materials&#160;with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here the readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection&#160;capability with the dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to that of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerizationprovides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemical triggered loss of dinitrogen affords cumulenes and not C&#8208;H insertion products. Pyridine derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral control of gas&#8208;phase molecules using microwave pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation &#8211; in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Synthesis of Enantiopure [6]Helicene Containing a Seven&#8208;Membered Ring and [7]Helicene via Acid&#8208;Promoted Stepwise Alkyne Annulations of Doubly Axial&#8208;Chiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantiopure seven&#8208;membered ring embedded [6]helicene and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99% ee) with an opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereo&#8208;controlled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically&#8208;controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with an opposite helicity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Zn metal anodes enabled by trace amounts of underpotential deposition initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8208;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8208;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions.&#160;Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8208;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of ~70 &#181;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of ~26% at &#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8208;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Polythiophene Derivative with Excellent Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8208;3.91 eV/&#8208;6.22 eV, high electron mobility of 0.39 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2 S cm&#8208;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Near IR&#160;bandgap semiconducting&#160;2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework with rhombic lattice and high mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of electronic materials. However, 2D c&#8208;MOFs with band gaps in the Vis&#8208;NIR and high charge carrier mobility are rare. Most of the reported semiconducting 2D c&#8208;MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which largely limits their use in logic devices. Herein, we design a phenanthrotriphenylene&#8208;based, D2h&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended ligand (OHPTP), and synthesize the first rhombic 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystals (Cu2(OHPTP)). The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique AB layer stacking. The Cu2(OHPTP) is a p&#8208;type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of ~0.50 eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10 S cm&#8208;1 and high charge carrier mobility of ~10.0 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. Theoretical calculations underline the predominant role of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in this semiquinone&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Represented herein is heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free aromatic amides enabling population of 3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) configuration for bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yield (up to 34.7%) in confined films are achieved. Spectroscopic study and theoretical calculation demonstrated the strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling of 1(&#1087;,&#1087;*)/3(n,&#1087;*) and 1(n,&#1087;*)/3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) states within the aromatic amides (4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P1), 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;N&#8208;(yridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P2), 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P3)), as well as the robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress vibrational relaxation and stacking&#8208;induced quenching. The blue afterglow films can last for several seconds showcasing in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and white light afterglow. The high population of emissive 3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) states and facile accessibility of aromatic amide skeleton provide an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence at blue and other regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D&#160;Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24% (the certified efficiency is 24.16%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194 V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55%.</dc:description>

         <title>The Lewis acid&#8208;mediated radical stabilization and dynamic covalent bonding: tunable, reversible and photocontrollable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photo controllability. The addition of Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (BCF) into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer (1&#8208;1) led to a stable radical (1&#8226;&#8208;2B), which has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in conjunction with theoretical calculation. The radical species is stabilized mainly by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. The absorption maximum of the radical can be tuned by using different Lewis acids. Dimer 1&#8208;1 can be achieved back by addition of a stronger base into the solution of 1&#8226;&#8208;2B, exhibiting a reversible process. By introducing a photo BCF generator, the dissociation of the dimer and the formation of the radical adduct become photocontrollable.</dc:description>

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrix enables long MALDI MS imaging measurements of at least 72&#8197;hours. Using a photo&#8208;removable 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy acetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable matrix, which can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then perform as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP.







Abstract
Insufficient vacuum stability of matrix chemicals is a major limitation in matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of large tissue sample cohorts. Here, we designed and synthesized the photo&#8208;cleavable caged molecule 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP) and employed it for lipid MALDI&#8208;MSI of mouse brain tissue sections. DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP is vacuum&#8208;stable in a high vacuum MALDI ion source for at least 72&#8197;h. Investigation of the uncaging process suggested that the built&#8208;in laser (355&#8197;nm) in the MALDI ion source promoted the in situ generation of 2,5&#8208;DHAP. A caging group is used for the first time in designing a MALDI matrix that is vacuum&#8208;stable, uncaged upon laser irradiation during the measurement process, and that boosts lipid ion intensity with MALDI&#8208;2 laser&#8208;induced postionization.

         <title>Amorphous NiFe Oxide&#8208;based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous NiFe oxide&#8208;based nanoreactors were synthesized and applied as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The nanoreactor structure changes the catalyst&#8242;s spatial curvature and mass transfer, enriching OH&#8722; on the catalyst surface and inside the channels, so that a high current density is obtained. In addition, the combination of amorphousness and nanoreactors synergistically promotes oxygen evolution, achieving the effect of &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221;.







Abstract
Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe&#8208;ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self&#8208;catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe&#8208;ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine&#8208;grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&#8722; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non&#8208;nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergy of crystalline state and morphology.

         <title>Studying Regioisomer Formation in the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorination of Cyclic Vinyl Triflates: Evidence for in situ Ligand Modification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the regioisomer formation in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates. Results suggested that the TESCF3 additive unlocked an alternative reaction pathway involving a usual in situ ligand dearomatization. This new mechanism prevented the formation of Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne intermediates and significantly increased the regioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic fluorination reactions are important methods for the synthesis of fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3 significantly improved the regioselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focusing on the role of TESCF3. The poor regioselectivity of the reaction in the absence of additives results from the formation of LPd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes (L=biaryl monophosphine ligand). When TESCF3 is added to the reaction mixture, the generation of the Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes is diminished by an unexpected pathway involving the dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3&#8722;).

&lt;p&gt;A combined experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the regioisomer formation in the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates. Results suggested that the TESCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additive unlocked an alternative reaction pathway involving a usual in situ ligand dearomatization. This new mechanism prevented the formation of Pd-cyclohexyne intermediates and significantly increased the regioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective free carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond of amines has been achieved. Newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, chiral spiro phosphamides, were found to be key and promote the proton transfer of the ylide intermediates and control the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The reaction provides a new approach to amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Free carbene readily causes multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts that enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantioselectivity. Under irradiation with visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes that are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two metallic sites in a pristine bimetallic sulfide do not form sufficiently tight bonds with the C2 intermediate during CO2 photoreduction, which results in an incomplete C&#8722;C coupling, thus giving mixtures of C1 and C2 products. Partial oxidation of the bimetallic sulfide leads to the formation of triatomic sites, enabling enhanced C&#8722;C coupling of the key intermediates to selectively generate C2 products.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8722;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8722;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9&#8201;% and 96.7&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.

         <title>Enhancement of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity of 2D &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bipyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bipyridine motifs in the 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF, creates dedicated photoactive sites. Through a simple post&#8208;protonation strategy, the photo&#8208;generated electron&#8211;hole separation of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF was significantly enhanced and a hydrophilic pore channel was generated, which synergically lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution represents a promising and sustainable technology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based photocatalysts have received growing attention. A 2D fully conjugated ethylene&#8208;linked COF (BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF) was fabricated with a dedicated designed active site. The introduced bipyridine sites enable a facile post&#8208;protonation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the actives sites, which results in a largely improved charge&#8208;separation efficiency and increased hydrophilicity in the pore channels synergically. After modulating the degree of protonation, the optimal BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;PCOF exhibits a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, which surpasses the biphenyl&#8208;based COF 6 times. By using different types of acids, the post&#8208;protonation is proved to be a potential universal strategy for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution. This strategy would provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning Local Coordination Environments of Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Properties for Selective Colorimetric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for achieving the multi&#8208;enzymatic performance of SAzymes through regulating the coordination number of heterogeneous manganese single&#8208;atom catalysts (MnSA&#8722;Nx&#8722;C) is designed and implemented. A series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzyme is successfully built for the specific recognition of biological molecules.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next&#8208;generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi&#8208;enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi&#8208;enzymatic performances. The constructed MnSA&#8722;N3&#8208;coordinated SAzymes (MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and glutathione oxidase&#8208;like activities than that of MnSA&#8722;N4&#8722;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules. These findings provide atomic&#8208;level insight into the microenvironment of nanozymes, promoting rational design of other demanding biocatalysts.

         <title>Easy Access to Diverse Multiblock Copolymers with On&#8208;Demand Blocks via Thioester&#8208;Relayed In&#8208;Chain Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization is developed for preparation of diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures.







Abstract
Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with &#8776;100 blocks in only 2 to 4&#8197;steps.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Bi0.6Sb0.4Te: Elimination of Detrimental Band Inversion in BiTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual synergistic effect of Sb doping in BiTe is reported that eliminates the detrimental band inversion by weakening the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, thus leading to a rare overlap of conduction band and valence band that significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient. In addition, this effect enhances the carrier mobility owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A direction in the first Brillouin zone.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric materials are the key to miniaturizing refrigeration equipment and have great scientific and social implications, yet their application is hindered by their extreme scarcity. BiTe exhibiting strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling peaks ZT at 600&#8197;K. Herein, we discover the synergy effect of Sb doping in BiTe that eliminates the detrimental band inversion and leads to an overlap of conduction band (CB) and valence band that significantly increases the S from 33 to 124&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. In addition, this effect enhances the &#956; from 58 to 92&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A in the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Sb doping increases the anharmonicity, shortens the phonon lifetime and lowers &#954;lat. Finally, Se/Sb codoping further optimizes the ZT to 0.6 at 300&#8197;K, suggesting that Bi0.6Sb0.4Te1&#8722;ySey is a potential room&#8208;temperature TE material.

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Oriented Ultrathin Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane from Nanosheets towards Unprecedented Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented sub&#8208;200&#8208;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework membranes showed unprecedented CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation performances, respectively. Their formation was aided by the preparation of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet seeds via anisotropic etching, confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, and the use of a ZrS2 source during epitaxial growth.







Abstract
Concurrent regulation of crystallographic orientation and thickness of zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) membranes is challenging but promising for their performance enhancement. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped, 40&#8197;nm thick UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet (NS) seeds by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through innovating confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 165&#8197;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 membrane was prepared. The significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO2 permeance (2070 GPU) as well as high CO2/N2 selectivity (35.4), which surpassed the performance limits of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 180&#8197;nm&#8208;thick NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 membrane showing superb H2/CO2 separation performance with H2 permeance of 1230 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 41.3, was prepared with the above synthetic procedure.

         <title>In situ Interweaved Binder Framework Mitigating the Structural and Interphasial Degradations of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ interweaved binder with multiple binder&#8208;cathode chemical interactions and robust mechanical strength enables a strong cathode framework. By coordinating with transition&#8208;metal ions and preventing the continuous electrolyte attack, the cathode structural integrity and the chemistry/architecture of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase are improved, thus enabling high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading high&#8208;nickel cathodes with excellent stability.







Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes is compromised by the interphasial and structural degradations. Herein, we demonstrate that by applying an in situ interweaved binder, the cycling stability of high&#8208;nickel cathodes can be significantly improved. Specifically, the results show that the resilient binder network immobilizes the transition&#8208;metal ions, suppresses electrolyte oxidative decomposition, and mitigates cathode particles pulverization, thus resulting in suppressed cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover and ameliorated chemistry and architecture of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. Pouch full cells with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes achieve 0.02&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle at 1&#8197;C rate over 1&#8201;000 deep cycles at 4.4&#8197;V (vs. graphite). This work demonstrates a rational structural and compositional design strategy of polymer binders to mitigate the structural and interphasial degradations of high&#8208;Ni cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Diazadiboraacenes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes as novel B,N&#8208;acenes via a stable biradical is presented. Characterization of their photophysical properties revealed that the emission spectra can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron atom. In addition, short&#8208;lived phosphorescence has been demonstrated.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into hydrocarbon compounds greatly expands the chemical space of molecular materials. In this context, B&#8722;N doping takes a center stage due to its isosterism with a C=C&#8208;bond. Herein, we present a new and modular synthetic concept to access novel diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h using the B&#8722;N doped biradical 16 as intermediate. Characterization of the photophysical properties revealed the emission spectra of the diazadibora benzo[b]triphenylenes 7&#8201;a&#8211;h can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron&#8208;atom. All of the diazadibora compounds show a short life&#8208;time phosphorescence. Additionally, we were able to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation of the diazadiboraacene 7&#8201;a via intersystem crossing by quantum chemical calculations.

     alt="Diazadiboraacenes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Computations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a series of diazadiborabenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]triphenylenes as novel B,N-acenes via a stable biradical is presented. Characterization of their photophysical properties revealed that the emission spectra can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron atom. In addition, short-lived phosphorescence has been demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of heteroatoms into hydrocarbon compounds greatly expands the chemical space of molecular materials. In this context, B&#8722;N doping takes a center stage due to its isosterism with a C=C-bond. Herein, we present a new and modular synthetic concept to access novel diazadiborabenzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]triphenylenes &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;a&#8211;h&lt;/b&gt; using the B&#8722;N doped biradical &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt; as intermediate. Characterization of the photophysical properties revealed the emission spectra of the diazadibora benzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]triphenylenes &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;a&#8211;h&lt;/b&gt; can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron-atom. All of the diazadibora compounds show a short life-time phosphorescence. Additionally, we were able to rationalize the excited-state relaxation of the diazadiboraacene &lt;b&gt;7&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; via intersystem crossing by quantum chemical calculations. The new synthetic strategy provides an elegant route to various novel B&#8722;N doped acenes with great potential for applications in molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterostructures with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Long&#8208;lasting Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy strategy for achieving sustained efficient tumor treatment was developed by synthesizing Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs). Driven by the BIEFs, electrons in the Fe0 core were continuously transferred to the surface to reduce &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus ensuring a sustained Fenton&#8208;like reaction and &#8901;OH production and forcing tumor cells to undergo apoptosis through ERK signal activation.







Abstract
Sustained signal activation by hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) has great significance, especially for tumor treatment, but remains challenging. Here, a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF)&#8208;driven strategy was proposed for sustainable generation of &#8901;OH, thereby achieving long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy (LCDT). As a proof of concept, a novel Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O heterogeneous catalyst was designed and synthesized, in which the BIEF induced the transfer of electrons in the Fe core to the surface, reducing &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus achieving continuous Fenton&#8208;like reactions and &#8901;OH release for over 18&#8197;h, which is approximately 12 times longer than that of Fe3O4&#8722;Cu2O and 72 times longer than that of Cu2O nanoparticles. In vitro and in vivo antitumor results indicated that sustained &#8901;OH levels led to persistent extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signal activation and irreparable oxidative damage to tumor cells, which promoted irreversible tumor apoptosis. Importantly, this strategy provides ideas for developing long&#8208;acting nanoplatforms for various applications.

         <title>Stable Operation of Lithium Metal Batteries with Aggressive Cathode Chemistries at 4.9&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with electrodes. The modified electrolyte in this work shows excellent stability against highly active lithium metal anode and aggressive high&#8208;voltage cathode. It presents great potential for practical use considering fire retardancy and low&#8208;temperature tolerance, ensuring a long life span without safety hazards even under extreme conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with aggressive electrodes, especially at low temperatures. Here, we report a rational modification of the Li+ solvation structure to extend the voltage and temperature operating ranges of conventional electrolytes. Ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions as well as the electrochemical window of solvents were tailored to improve oxidation stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, robust and elastic B and F&#8208;rich interphases are formed on both electrodes. Such optimization enables Li||LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells (90.2&#8201;% retention after 400 cycles) and Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells (74.0&#8201;% retention after 200 cycles) to cycle stably at an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.9&#8197;V. Moreover, NCM622 cells deliver a considerable capacity of 143.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, showing great potential for practical uses. The proposed strategy sheds light on further optimization for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Regioisomeric Benzidine&#8208;Fullerenes: Tuning of the Diverse Hole&#8208;Distribution to Influence Charge Separation Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three regioisomeric benzidine&#8208;fullerenes have been synthesized. Following charge separation (CS), para&#8208; manifests hole&#8208;delocalization, promoting ultrafast CS; while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208; cause hole&#8208;localization, contributing to long&#8208;lived CS state. This work reveals the influence of regional isomerism on charge distribution and CS.







Abstract
Understanding the influence of molecular structure on charge distribution and charge separation (CS) provides essential guidance for optoelectronic materials design. Here we propose a regioisomeric strategy to tune the diverse hole&#8208;distribution, and probe the influence on CS patterns. Para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;substituted benzidine&#8208;fullerene, named 1&#8201;p, 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o are designed. Following CS, hole&#8208;delocalization occurs in 1&#8201;p, while hole&#8208;localization exists in 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o. The rates of charge separation (4.02&#215;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) and recombination (9.8&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1) of 1&#8201;p is about 20 and 12&#8197;times faster than 1&#8201;m and 1&#8201;o, indicating that para&#8208;determined delocalization promotes ultrafast CS, while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;generated localization contributes to long&#8208;lived CS states. Computational analysis further implies that localization results from the destruction of electronic conjugation for 1&#8201;m, and limitation of conformational relaxation for 1&#8201;o. Given that the universality and simplicity of regional isomerism, this work opens up new thoughts for molecular design with tunable charge separation patterns.

         <title>Engineered Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizers for Effective Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) was designed and synthesized using a molecular engineering approach for building blocks of RuII metallacycles. Subsequently, the photosensitizer with the highest reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency, biocompatibility, and phototoxicity index (PI), RuD, was selected for safe and effective photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Although metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedicine, their clinical translation is still hindered by their inherent dark toxicity. Herein, we report what to our knowledge is the first example of a molecular engineering approach to building blocks of metallacycles for constructing a series of supramolecular PSs (RuA&#8211;RuD), with the aim of simultaneously reducing dark toxicity and enhancing phototoxicity, and consequently obtaining high phototoxicity indexes (PI). Detailed in vitro investigations demonstrate that RuA&#8211;RuD display high cancer cellular uptake and remarkable antitumor activity even under hypoxic conditions. Notably, RuD exhibited no dark toxicity and displayed the highest PI value (&#8776;406). Theoretical calculations verified that RuD has the largest steric hindrance and the lowest singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST, 0.61&#8197;eV). Further in vivo studies confirmed that RuD allows safe and effective phototherapy against A549 tumors.

         <title>Manipulation of the Buried Interface for Robust Formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells with NiOx Hole&#8208;Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly efficient and stable formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FASn0.5Pb0.5I3) perovskite solar cell with NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer, which is realized by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with multifunctional 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722;) interlayer.







Abstract
Low band gap tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs) are expected to achieve higher efficiencies than Pb&#8208;PSCs and regarded as key components of tandem PSCs. However, the realization of high efficiency is challenged by the instability of Sn2+ and the imperfections at the charge transfer interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an efficient ideal band gap formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb (FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3) PSC, by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or I&#8722;) interlayer, which exhibits fascinating functions of reducing the surface defects of the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL), enhancing the perovskite film quality, and improving both the energy level matching and physical contact at the interface. The effects of different halide anions have been elaborated and a 20.53&#8201;% efficiency is obtained with OH&#8208;PEABr, which is the highest one for FA&#8208;based Sn&#8722;Pb PSCs using NiOx HTLs. Moreover, the device stability is also boosted.

         <title>Identification of Active Sites Formed on Cobalt Oxyhydroxide in Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides are well&#8208;known catalysts for biomass electrooxidation to produce valuable chemicals. However, identification of active site remains elusive, owing to the structural complexity under reaction conditions. In this work, a suite of operando spectroscopies and theoretical calculations were combined, unveiling two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species as the active sites in cobalt oxyhydroxide for glucose electrooxidation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based oxyhydroxides are efficient catalysts in biomass electrooxidation towards fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free production of valuable chemicals. However, identification of active sites remains elusive. Herein, using cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as the archetype and the electrocatalyzed glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) as the model reaction, we track dynamic transformation of the electronic and atomic structure of the catalyst using a suite of operando and ex situ techniques. We reveal that two types of reducible Co3+&#8208;oxo species are afforded for the GOR, including adsorbed hydroxyl on Co3+ ion (&#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+) and di&#8208;Co3+&#8208;bridged lattice oxygen (&#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+). Moreover, theoretical calculations unveil that &#956;1&#8208;OH&#8722;Co3+ is responsible for oxygenation, while &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;Co3+ mainly contributes to dehydrogenation, both as key oxidative steps in glucose&#8208;to&#8208;formate transformation. This work provides a framework for mechanistic understanding of the complex near&#8208;surface chemistry of metal oxyhydroxides in biomass electrorefining.

         <title>A Highly Stable Organic Luminescent Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable&#8208;temperature EPR measurements as well as theoretical calculations have been carried out on a highly stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent M&#252;ller hydrocarbon. The results that the hydrocarbon has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%, with the small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enabling thermal excitation to a triplet state.







Abstract
It is very challenging to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent open&#8208;shell singlet diradicals. Herein we report the first stable M&#252;ller's hydrocarbon TTM&#8208;PhTTM with luminescent properties. Variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations show that TTM&#8208;PhTTM has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90&#8201;%. Because of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, the open&#8208;shell singlet ground state can be thermally excited to a triplet state. TTM&#8208;PhTTM shows room&#8208;temperature deep&#8208;red emission in various solutions. Unusually high stability of TTM&#8208;PhTTM was also observed owing to effective steric hindrance and spin delocalization. Our results are beneficial to the rational design and discovery of more stable luminescent diradical materials.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Metals from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Carbothermal Shock Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbothermal shock (CTS) method with high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures (up to &#8776;2200&#8201;&#176;C), and ultrafast reaction times of &#8776;20&#8197;s is utilized for recycling spent cathode materials. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Pyrometallurgy technique is usually applied as a pretreatment to enhance the leaching efficiencies in the hydrometallurgy process for recovering valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, traditional pyrometallurgy processes are energy and time consuming. Here, we report a carbothermal shock (CTS) method for reducing LiNi0.3Co0.2Mn0.5O2 (NCM325) cathode materials with uniform temperature distribution, high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures, and ultrafast reaction times. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching after CTS process with an efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;%. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98&#8201;%. The CTS reduction strategy is feasible for various spent cathode materials, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, NCM811, LiCoO2, and LiMn2O4. The CTS process, with its low energy consumption and potential scale application, provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way for recovering spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

The CTS reduction strategy is feasible for various spent cathode materials, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, NCM811, LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The CTS process, with its low energy consumption and potential scale application, provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way for recovering spent lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unequal Perylene Diimide Twins in a Quadruple Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a quadruple assembly (POP)4, two identical perylene diimide (PDI) units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550). The two groups of spectrally distinct PDI units provide a rapid gradient&#8208;directed energy transfer from P520 to P550.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labor&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, the construction of such kinds of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne&#8208;bridged ortho&#8208;perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self&#8208;assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4. The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also developed a two&#8208;step cooperative model. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple couplings within and across P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly. This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.

         <title>Highly Selective Photoelectroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol over Graphene/Silicon Carbide Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial layer in the graphene/silicon carbide composite allows the facile transfer of photogenerated electrons from the silicon carbide substrate to the active sites of graphene, resulting in efficient CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling for ethanol production. This catalyst showed a near&#8208;perfect ethanol selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% at an exceedingly high CO2 conversion rate of 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and stability in ambient CO2 photoelectroreduction.







Abstract
Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO2), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C2 compounds with a high CO2 conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO2 photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity of&gt;99&#8201;% and a CO2 conversion rate of up to 17.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few&#8208;layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO2 to C2H5OH conversion pathway.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H/O2 Dual Activation and Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole Grafted Macrocyclic Inhibitors for Influenza H1N1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here is an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. DFT calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The phenotypic screening result indicated that some macrocyclic products have a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity.







Abstract
The development of environment&#8208;friendly, step economic couplings to generate structurally diverse macrocyclic compounds is highly desirable but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by the C&#8722;H oxidation mechanism of cytochromes&#8197;P450, an unprecedented and practical RhIII&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation has been developed by us. The process of macrocyclization is facilitated by a synergic coordination from pyridine and ester group. Interestingly, the reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8722;H/O2 dual activation. The newly achieved acylmethylation macrocyclic products and their derivatives showed a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity, which may provide an opportunity for the discovery of novel anti&#8208;H1N1 macrocyclic leading compounds.

         <title>A Compartmentalized Nanoreactor Formed by Interfacial Hydrogelation for Cascade Enzyme Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compartmented Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD&#160;was constructed by a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and core&#8211;shell cascade laccase&#8208;SOD and SOD&#8208;Fenton catalytic therapy were explored. The work introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and specificity to natural enzymes.







Abstract
Some cellular enzymatic pathways are located within a single organelle, while most others involve enzymes that are located within multiple compartmentalized cellular organelles to realize the efficient multi&#8208;step enzymatic process. Herein, bioinspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated biosynthesis and biochemical defense, a compartmented nanoreactor (Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD) was constructed through a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy with burr defect&#8208;engineered molybdenum disulfide/Prussian blue analogues (MoS2/PBA) and an interfacial diffusion&#8208;controlled hydrogel network. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and cascade enzyme catalytic therapy were explored. The confined hydrogelation strategy introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and provides insight into biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and also the specificity to natural enzymes.

         <title>Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Nonlinear Optical Switch with a Linearly Tunable Tc Spanning a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2SxSe1&#8722;xO4 that represent the first NLO switch material exhibiting a linearly tunable phase transition temperature, the switching temperature can be linearly tuned from 430 to 356&#8197;K, which originates from a linear decrease in the phase transition energy barrier that is predominantly controlled by the internal energy difference between phases.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (Tc) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of Tc remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable Tc has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal P

&lt;p&gt;For a series of isostructural solid-solution crystals [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; that represent the first NLO switch material exhibiting a linearly tunable phase transition temperature, the switching temperature can be linearly tuned from 430 to 356&#8197;K, which originates from a linear decrease in the phase transition energy barrier that is predominantly controlled by the internal energy difference between phases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second-harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=8.5569(2)&#8197;&#197; and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=6.5208(2)&#8197;&#197; that exhibits a strong SHG intensity (1.3&#215;KDP) and a large birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;obv.&lt;/sub&gt;=0.08). This compound forms a series of isostructural solid-solution crystals [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400 Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and high lipophilicity of trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), methods for introducing OCF3 into organic molecules are in high demand. However, the research area of direct enantioselective tri&#64258;uoromethoxylation is still in the embryonic stage, with limited enantioselectivity and/or reaction types.

         <title>Electronic Structure Manipulation of the Mott Insulator RuCl&#8323; via Single Crystal to Single Crystal Topotactic Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The core task for Mott insulators includes how rigid distributions of electrons evolve and how these induce exotic physical phenomena. However, it is highly challenging to chemically dope Mott insulators to tune properties. Herein, we report how to tailor electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott insulator RuCl3 employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation process. The resulting product (NH4)0.5RuCl3&#183;1.5H2O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers with NH4+ and H2O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7 eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 103 folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking a (pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8220;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only due to their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. The computational studies allowed to explain the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest, via a process that we named &#8216;shoehorning&#8217;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size in order to slide in and out the metallobox.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Instability in van der Waals In2Se3 Determined by Surface Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>van der Waals In2Se3 has attracted significant attention for its room&#8208;temperature 2D ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity down to monolayer thickness. However, instability and potential degradation pathway in 2D In2Se3 have not yet been adequately addressed. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we here unravel the phase instability in both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8217;&#8208;In2Se3 originating from the relatively unstable octahedral coordination. Together with the broken bonds at the edge steps, it leads to moisture&#8208;facilitated oxidation of In2Se3 in air to form amorphous In2Se3&#8208;3xO3x layers and Se hemisphere particles. Both O2 and H2O are required for such surface oxidation, which can be further promoted by light illumination. In addition, the self&#8208;passivation effect from the In2Se3&#8208;3 x O3 x  layer can effectively limit such oxidation to only a few nanometer thickness. The achieved insight paves way for better understanding and optimizing 2D In2Se3 performance for device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Analogue of Heptacene Entailing Quinoidal Benzodi[7]annulene (7/6/7 Ring) Core with Tunable Configuration and Multiple Redox Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid acenes entailing heptagons have received increasing attentions. We herein report a heptacene analogue entailing the quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core. Derivatives of this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene were obtained through an efficient synthetic strategy with Aldo condensation and Diels&#8208;Alder reaction as key steps. The configuration of this heptacene analogue can be modulated from the wavy to the curved one by just varying the substitutents from (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl group to 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Trip) group. When mesityl (Mes) groups are linked to the heptagons, the resulting non&#8208;benzenoid acene displays polymorphism with tunable configuration from the curved to the wavy one by varying the crystallization conditions. In addition, this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene can be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion. Compared with the neutral acene, the radical anion shows wavy configuration and the central hexagon becomes aromatic.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-benzenoid acenes entailing heptagons have received increasing attentions. We herein report a heptacene analogue entailing the quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core. Derivatives of this new non-benzenoid acene were obtained through an efficient synthetic strategy with Aldo condensation and Diels-Alder reaction as key steps. The configuration of this heptacene analogue can be modulated from the wavy to the curved one by just varying the substitutents from (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl group to 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl (Trip) group. When mesityl (Mes) groups are linked to the heptagons, the resulting non-benzenoid acene displays polymorphism with tunable configuration from the curved to the wavy one by varying the crystallization conditions. In addition, this new non-benzenoid acene can be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion. Compared with the neutral acene, the radical anion shows wavy configuration and the central hexagon becomes aromatic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiazolylazopyrazoles as Nonsymmetric Bis&#8208;Heteroaryl Azo Switches: High&#8208;Yield Visible&#8208;Light Photoisomerization and Increased Z&#8208;Isomer Stability by o&#8208;Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Following the progress on mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ph), a few bis&#8208;heteroaryl ones (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het) have been studied recently, while the nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl ones (Het1&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het2) that can combine the respective merit of each heterocycle receive little attention. Here we report thiazolylazopyrazoles as nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches that combine the visible&#8208;light switching character favored by thiazole ring and the ease of o&#8208;substitutions on pyrazole ring. They can achieve (near&#8208;)quantitative visible&#8208;light isomerization in both directions and long Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives of several days. In contrast to the drastically destabilizing effect of o&#8208;methylation, o&#8208;carbonylation can remarkably stabilize Z isomers by inducing intramolecular attractions (dispersion, C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N bond, and lone&#8208;pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction). Our work highlights the importance of rational combination of two heterocycles and suitable structural substitution in developing bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic Chromophore Amphiphiles and their Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amphiphiles in water is an attractive approach to create functional nanostructures with applications in artificial photosynthesis, sensing, and electronics. Here, we report on the synthesis, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, aqueous supramolecular polymerization, and conductivity of polycyclic aromatic dicarboximide amphiphiles. The chemical structure of the model perylene monoimide amphiphile was modified with heterocycles, effectively substituting one fused benzene ring with thiophene, pyridine or pyrrole rings. All the heterocycle&#8208;containing monomers investigated were found to undergo supramolecular polymerization in water. We find that large changes to the monomeric molecular dipole moments, which result in their significant increase or decrease, led to nanostructures with low electrical conductivity due to diminished interactions. Although the substitution of benzene with tiophene did not notably change the monomer dipole moment, it led to crystalline nanoribbons with 20&#8208;fold higher electrical conductivity, due to enhanced dispersion interactions as a result of the presence of sulfur atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed the versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#173;&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescence substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100 nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590 nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) assisted genome mining strategy was developed for the discovery of glycosyltransferase (GT) from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. A di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 was discovered and characterized which is capable to catalyze platycoside E (PE) synthesis via the attachment of two &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;linked glucosyl residues sequentially to the glucosyl residue at the C&#8208;3 position of platycodin D (PD). Although UDP&#8208;glucose is the most preferred sugar donor for PgGT1, it could also utilize UDP&#8208;xylose and UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine as weak donors. Residues S273, E274, and H350 played important roles in stabilizing the glucose donor and positioning the glucose at the optimal orientation for the glycosylation reaction. This study clarified two key steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PE and could greatly contribute to improving its industrial biotransformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Diamines via Reductive Coupling of Ketimines Templated by Chiral Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines, providing for the first time a series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines in excellent ee&#8217;s and good to high yields. The powerful and efficient diboron&#8208;participated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatriopic rearrangement is successfully demonstrated on homocoupling of a variety of ketimines thanks to rational design and engineering of chiral diborons. Systematic DFT studies suggest that two chiral diborons adopt different conformational assembling strategies to couple the diboron template with ketimine substrates in their tight concerted transition states to ensure the excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated on asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes by employing a chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamine&#8208;based organocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photocatalyst TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt is developed with a self&#8208;grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC, and selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on Ti&#8208;BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC, works in a direct Z&#8208;scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti&#8208;BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8 wt.%. The selective location of Pt is the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4 mmol&#8201;g&#8208;1&#8201;h&#8208;1 compared to other TiO2&#8208; or MOF&#8208;based catalysts. The structure&#8208;performance relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#160;Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition&#160;of Hybrid Copper Halides&#160;with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, a&#8208; and b&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+ = CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir Nanoparticles Anchored on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Overall Water Splitting under pH&#8208;Universal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of high&#8208;activity and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is critical for efficient hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Herein, we developed an advanced electrocatalyst by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;NDC (NDC: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic) nanosheets. Benefiting from the strong synergy between Ir and MOF through interfacial Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ir bonds, the synthesized Ir@Ni&#8208;NDC showed exceptional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in a wide pH range, superior to commercial benchmarks and most reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the charge redistribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ir bridge induced the optimization of H2O, OH* and H* adsorption, thus leading to the accelerated electrochemical kinetics for HER and OER. This work provides a new clue to exploit bifunctional electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Microtubular Covalent Organic Frameworks Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore environment and aggregated structure play a vital role in determining the properties of porous materials, especially regarding the mass transfer. Reticular chemistry imparts covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;aligned micro/mesopores, yet constructing hierarchical architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation methodology to prepare microtubular COFs. In this process, the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units, leading to the crystal transformation of COFs. Moreover, the aggregated structure and conversion degree varied with the reaction time, where the hollow tubular aggregates composed of mixed COF crystals could be obtained. Such hierarchical architecture leads to enhanced mass transfer properties, as proved by the adsorption measurement and chemical catalytic reactions. This self&#8208;template strategy was successfully applied to another four COFs with different building units.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Pyrolysis Construction of Carbon Anodes with 8400 h Lifespan for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density K&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonaceous materials are promising anodes for practical potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but fail to meet the requirements for durability and high capacities at low potentials. Herein, we constructed a durable carbon anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion full cells by a preferential pyrolysis strategy. Utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked supermolecule, the preferential pyrolysis process introduces low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized carbon and carbon vacancies, endowing a low&#8208;potential &#8220;vacancy&#8208;adsorption/intercalation&#8221; mechanism. The as&#8208;prepared carbon anode exhibits a high capacity of 384.2 mAh g&#8722;1 (90% capacity locates below 1 V vs. K/K+), which contributes to a high energy density of 163 Wh kg&#8211;1 of K&#8208;ion full battery. Moreover, abundant vacancies of carbon alleviate volume variation, boosting the cycling stability over 14,000 cycles (8,400 h). Our work provides a new synthesis approach for durable carbon anodes of K&#8208;ion full cells with high energy densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Type &#921; Photodynamic Therapy Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Elicits Augmented Immunity for Cancer Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Type &#1030; photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising treatment modality for tumors with intrinsic hypoxia. However, type &#921; photosensitizers (PSs), especially with near infrared (NIR) absorption, are limited and their efficacy needs improvement via new targeting tactics. We develop a NIR type &#1030; PS by engineering acridinium derived donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems. The PS exhibits an exclusive type &#1030; PDT mechanism due to effective intersystem crossing and disfavored energy transfer to O2, and shows selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) via multiple hydrogen bonds in molecular docking study. Moreover, it enables fluorogenic detection of G4s and efficient O2&#8226;&#8722; production in hypoxic conditions, leading to immunogenic cell death and substantial variations of gene expressions in RNA sequencing. Our strategy demonstrates augmented antitumor immunity for effective ablation of immunogenic cold tumor, highlighting its potential of RNA&#8208;targeted type &#921; PDT in precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;N Coupling through Hydroaminoalkylation on a Single&#8208;Atom Rh Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly dispersed Rh1O4 sites anchored on the support of a heterogeneous catalyst are highly active and selective for hydroaminoalkylation at 110&#8201;&#176;C. Different from a Rh molecular catalyst, this Rh single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalyst can be readily separated from products and be reused in multiple runs with similar catalytic performance.







Abstract
C&#8722;N coupling is significant for the synthesis of fine chemicals toward various applications. Hydroaminoalkylation of olefins is a tandem reaction of C&#8722;N coupling involving first the formation of an aldehyde through hydroformylation of an olefin and then the production of amine through reductive amination of the aldehyde. Here we report a stable, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh1 atoms anchored on TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles designated as Rh1/P25.

     alt="C&#8722;N Coupling through Hydroaminoalkylation on a Single-Atom Rh Heterogeneous Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singly dispersed Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites anchored on the support of a heterogeneous catalyst are highly active and selective for hydroaminoalkylation at 110&#8201;&#176;C. Different from a Rh molecular catalyst, this Rh single-atom heterogeneous catalyst can be readily separated from products and be reused in multiple runs with similar catalytic performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;N coupling is significant for the synthesis of fine chemicals toward various applications. Hydroaminoalkylation of olefins is a tandem reaction of C&#8722;N coupling involving first the formation of an aldehyde through hydroformylation of an olefin and then the production of amine through reductive amination of the aldehyde. Here we report a stable, supported catalyst of singly dispersed Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; atoms anchored on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P25) nanoparticles designated as Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P25. Its high activity for C&#8722;N coupling was demonstrated by six hydroaminoalkylations of olefins and amines with selectivity of higher than 90% for producing tertiary amines. The singly dispersed Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on P25 exhibit activity and selectivity for hydroaminoalkylation comparable or even higher than some reported molecular catalysts. In contrast to molecular catalysts, the Rh-based single-atom Rh heterogeneous catalysis (Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P25) can be readily separated from reactants and products, reused for multiple runs of hydroaminoalkylation, and recycled with a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deuterodehalogenation Under Net Reductive or Redox&#8208;Neutral Conditions Enabled by Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific introduction of deuterium is important in organic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the deuterodehalogenation of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides, using inexpensive deuterium oxide as the deuterium source. We also uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates.







Abstract
Interest in deuterated active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is increasing as deuteration holds promise for kinetic isotope effect (KIE) regulated fine&#8208;tuning of API performance. Moreover, deuterium isotope labeling is frequently carried out to study organic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms and to facilitate complex target synthesis. As such, methods for highly selective deuteration of organic molecules are highly desirable. Herein, we present an electrochemical method for the selective deuterodehalogenation of benzylic halides via a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, using inexpensive deuterium oxide (D2O) as the deuterium source. We demonstrate broad functional group compatibility across a range of aryl and heteroaryl benzylic halides. Furthermore, we uncover a sequential paired electrolysis regime, which permits switching between net reductive and overall redox&#8208;neutral reactions of sulfur&#8208;containing substrates simply by changing the identity of the sacrificial reductant employed.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Probe for Nuclear ATP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small&#8208;molecule probe for nuclear ATP is reported. The probe, a ZnII complex of a push&#8208;full type benzocoumarin dye bearing a dipicolylamine ligand, reversibly binds to nuclear ATP with a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. Using the probe, we observed markedly higher levels of nuclear ATP in organ tissues of a tumor&#8208;xenografted mouse by two&#8208;photon microscopy, which is ascribed to aggressive cell progression in the mitosis phase.







Abstract
Fluorescence monitoring of ATP in different organelles is now feasible with a few biosensors developed, which, however, show low sensitivity, limited biocompatibility, and accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule ATP probes that alleviate those limitations thus have received much attention recently, leading to a few ATP probes that target several organelles except for the nucleus. We disclose the first small&#8208;molecule probe that selectively detects nuclear ATP through reversible binding, with 25&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH&#8197;7.4 and excellent selectivity against various biologically relevant species. Using the probe, we observed 2.1&#8211;3.3&#8208;fold and 3.9&#8211;7.8&#8208;fold higher nuclear ATP levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared with normal cell lines and tissues, respectively, which are explained by the higher nuclear ATP level in the mitosis phase. The probe has great potential for studying nuclear ATP&#8208;associated biology.

         <title>Tuning Hole Transport Properties via Pyrrole Derivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost hole transport materials T3, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms, have been designed and synthesized for high performance perovskite solar cells. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to tune energy levels and other properties of T3 materials.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) with high hole mobility, good band alignment and ease of fabrication are highly desirable for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized novel organic HTMs, named T3, which can be synthesized in high yields with commercially available materials, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to obtain a variety of T3&#8208;based HTMs with tunable energy levels and other properties. Among them, fluorine&#8208;substituted T3 (T3&#8208;F) exhibits the best band alignment and hole extraction properties, leading to PSCs with outstanding PCEs of 24.85&#8201;% and 24.03&#8201;% (certified 23.46&#8201;%) for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1&#8197;cm2, respectively. The simple structure and tunable performance of T3 can inspire further optimization for efficient PSCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;Sultines by a Photoinduced Radical Addition&#8211;Polar Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines has been developed. The reaction proceeds with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and good yields. Key to the success of the protocol is use of oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents.







Abstract
Despite the significance of sultines in synthesis, medicine, and materials science, the chemistry of sultines has remained unexplored due to their inaccessibility. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines. The reactions proceed by single electron transfer induced multifluoromethyl radical addition to an alkene followed by SO2 incorporation, and single&#8208;electron reduction for polar 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet cyclization. Key to the success of the protocol is the use of easily oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents. The reactions proceed with excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance to deliver &#947;&#8208;sultines in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free covalent triazine frameworks were designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. By deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and selectivity. Epoxidation of styrene with peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate produced styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% and near quantitative conversion.







Abstract
Using photocatalytic oxidation to convert basic chemicals into high value compounds in environmentally benign reaction media is a current focus in catalytic research. The challenge lies in gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. We design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free, and recyclable photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. Selectivity in product formation was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and over 99&#8201;% selectivity as a single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% with near quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.

The challenge lies in gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. We design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal-free, and recyclable photocatalysts for visible-light-driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. Selectivity in product formation was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99&#8201;% conversion and over 99&#8201;% selectivity as a single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as an initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76&#8201;% with near quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the design and development of Co/Al and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide (PSPO) bifunctional ligand, for the site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H alkenylation of nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroarenes with alkynes. These catalysts enable the alkenylation of pyridine, pyridone, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives at the C&#8211;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen atom, which represents a selectivity profile distinct from that of the previously developed cobalt&#8211;diphosphine/aluminum catalyst. The alkenylated products were obtained in moderate to good yields using various heterocycles and differently substituted internal alkynes. Kinetic isotope effect experiments suggest the irreversibility of the C&#8211;H activation step, the relevance of which to the rate&#8208;limiting step depends on the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer is the common mechanism of C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Activity Trend Origin of Ethanol Oxidative Dehydrogenation over VOx/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported vanadia (VOx) is a versatile catalyst for various redox processes, where ceria&#8208;supported VOx have shown to be particularly active in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alcohols. In this work, we clarify the origin of the volcano&#8208;shaped ethanol ODH activity trend for VOx/CeOx catalysts using operando quick V K&#8208; and Ce L3&#8208; edge XAS experiments performed under transient conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate that both vanadium and cerium are synergistically involved in alcohol ODH. The concentration of reversible Ce4+/Ce3+ species was identified as the main descriptor of the alcohol ODH activity. The activity drop in the volcano plot, observed at above ca. 3 V/nm2 surface loading (ca. 30% of VOx monolayer coverage), is related to the formation of spectator V4+ and Ce3+ species, which were identified here for the first time. These results might prove to be helpful for the rational optimization of VOx/CeO2 catalysts and the refinement of the theoretical models.</dc:description>

         <title>Haloboration of o&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols Generates Halogenated Bicyclic&#8208;Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxaborinines are intermediates en&#8208;route to bicyclic boronates that are important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Herein, the haloboration of o&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;phenols using BX3 (X = Cl or Br) is disclosed as a route to form C4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoxaborinines with good functional group tolerance. Computational studies indicated that there are two similar in barrier mechanisms: (i) double alkyne haloboration followed by retro&#8208;haloboration; (ii) concerted trans&#8208;haloboration involving an exogenous chloride source. The C4&#8208;halide in these benzoxaborinines is useful, with a one&#8208;pot haloboration&#8208;Negishi cross coupling protocol effective to form benzoxaborinines with an alkyl or an aryl at C4. Therefore this method is a useful addition to the toolbox for synthesizing bicyclic&#8208;boronates that are attracting increasing attention as APIs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cooperative Rhodium/Secondary Phosphine Oxide [Rh/P(O)nBu2] Template for Catalytic Hydrodefluorination of Perfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective activation of C&#8208;F bonds under mild reaction conditions remains an ongoing challenge of bond activation. Here, we present a cooperative [Rh/P(O)nBu2] template for catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of perfluoroarenes. In addition to substrates presenting electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, the system showed a high tolerance for exceedingly rare electron&#8208;donating functionalities and heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalyst and its readiness to be deployed at a preparative scale illustrate its practicality. Empirical mechanistic studies and a density functional theory (DFT) study have identified a rhodium(I) dihydride complex as a catalytically relevant species and the determining role of phosphine oxide as a cooperative fragment. Altogether, we demonstrate that molecular templates based on these design elements can be assembled to create catalysts with increased reactivity for challenging bond activations.</dc:description>

         <title>Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity in the Zirconium Acid Triphosphate ZrH5(PO4)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of solid&#8208;state proton conductors with high proton conductivity at low temperatures is crucial for the implementation of hydrogen&#8208;based technologies for portable and automotive applications. Here, we report on the discovery of a new crystalline metal acid triphosphate, ZrH5(PO4)3 (ZP3), which exhibits record&#8208;high proton conductivity of 0.5 &#8211; 3.1 x 10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1 in the range 25 &#8211; 110 &#176;C in anhydrous conditions. This is the highest anhydrous proton conductivity ever reported in a crystalline solid proton conductor in the range 25 &#8211; 110 &#176;C. Superprotonic conductivity in ZP3 is enabled by extended defective&#160;frustrated hydrogen bond chains, where the protons are dynamically disordered over two oxygen centers. The high proton conductivity and stability in anhydrous conditions make ZP3 an excellent candidate for innovative applications in fuel cells without the need for complex water management systems, and in other energy technologies requiring fast proton transfer.</dc:description>

RNA is increasingly considered a therapeutic target of interest for small molecules. We report an in&#8208;depth analysis of 36 high throughput small molecule microarray screens against nucleic acid targets. Development of machine learning algorithms revealed a complex set of physicochemical properties that can distinguish between RNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;binding drug&#8208;like small molecules.







Abstract
Small molecule targeting of RNA has emerged as a new frontier in medicinal chemistry, but compared to the protein targeting literature our understanding of chemical matter that binds to RNA is limited. In this study, we reported Repository Of BInders to Nucleic acids (ROBIN), a new library of nucleic acid binders identified by small molecule microarray (SMM) screening. The complete results of 36 individual nucleic acid SMM screens against a library of 24&#8201;572 small molecules were reported (including a total of 1&#8201;627&#8201;072 interactions assayed). A set of 2&#8201;003 RNA&#8208;binding small molecules was identified, representing the largest fully public, experimentally derived library of its kind to date. Machine learning was used to develop highly predictive and interpretable models to characterize RNA&#8208;binding molecules. This work demonstrates that machine learning algorithms applied to experimentally derived sets of RNA binders are a powerful method to inform RNA&#8208;targeted chemical space.

         <title>Confining the Sol&#8208;Gel Reaction at the Water/Oil Interface: Creating Compartmentalized Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Organelles for Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the compartmentalization of enzyme reactions in living organisms, in this study we developed an efficient and safe method for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core mesoporous nanocapsules. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, were able to successfully perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in the eukaryotic cells.







Abstract
Living organisms compartmentalize their catalytic reactions in membranes for increased efficiency and selectivity. To mimic the organelles of eukaryotic cells, we develop a mild approach for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core silica nanocapsules. In order to confine the sol&#8208;gel reaction at the water/oil interface of miniemulsion, we introduce an aminosilane to the silica precursors, which serves as both catalyst and an amphiphilic anchor that electrostatically assembles with negatively charged hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes at the interface. The semi&#8208;permeable shell protects enzymes from proteolytic attack, and allows the transport of reactants and products. The enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, are able to perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions in eukaryotic cells. This in situ encapsulation approach provides a versatile platform for the delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Hydride [AuI7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 cluster complex: Structure, Transformation, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (Au7H52+), a poly&#8208;hydride AuI cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, is prepared. Upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm) it decomposes to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (Au82+). The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%).







Abstract
Hydride AuI bonds are labile due to the mismatch in electric potential of an oxidizing metal and reducing ligand, and therefore the structure and structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanoclusters that contain them are seldom studied. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of [Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (abbrev. Au7H52+), an Au cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, which decomposed to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (abbrev. Au82+) upon exposure to light (300 to 450&#8197;nm). The valence state of AuI and H&#8722; was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV/Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2&#8201;% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5&#8201;%). Further DFT calculations showed that the H&#8722; ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron&#8208;donor H.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and heterogeneous artificial SEI film is constructed via in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets with Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of Li+, and lower the nucleation barrier.







Abstract
Constructing efficient artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of &#8776;50&#8197;mV for 750&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2&#8201;% in full cells with a high lithium iron phosphate areal loading of &#8776;13&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Based Reactive Oxygen Species Supergenerator for Immunogenic Photochemotherapy against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides new insight and design guidelines for the construction of reactive oxygen species supergenerators by molecular engineering. An integrated perylene therapeutic platform was developed that efficiently realizes immunogenic photochemotherapy against hypoxic tumors.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as cytotoxic radicals to directly kill tumor cells and concurrently trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) to efficiently achieve tumor therapy. Thus motivated, we herein present one perylene monoamide&#8208;based ROS supergenerator (PMIC&#8208;NC) that not only induces hypoxia&#8208;enhanced Type&#8208;I ROS burst aided by proton transients but also triggers Type&#8208;I/II ROS production by electron or energy transfer under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation and also elicits a strong ICD effect. More interesting, the mitochondria&#8208; and lung&#8208;specific distribution of PMIC&#8208;NC also boosts the tumor therapeutic efficiency. As a result, PMIC&#8208;NC was employed for NIR&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy, hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and also displayed robust immunogenicity for systemic tumor eradication. This work thus contributes one proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of perylene as an integrated therapeutic platform for efficient immunogenic photochemotherapy against hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Glycine Imine&#8212;The Elusive &#945;&#8208;Imino Acid Intermediate in the Reductive Amination of Glyoxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Iminoacetic acid or glycine imine is a proposed key intermediate in the reductive amination of glyoxylic acid. In contrast to well&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amino acids the compound class of &#945;&#8208;imino acids is not much explored and not well&#8208;characterized. Glycine imine was prepared through photochemical denitrogenation of 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid, spectroscopically characterized, and its reactivity studied in aqueous solution.







Abstract
Simple unhindered aldimines tend to hydrolyze or oligomerize and are therefore spectroscopically not well characterized. Herein we report the formation and spectroscopic characterization of the simplest imino acid, namely glycine imine, by cryogenic matrix isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Glycine imine forms after UV irradiation of 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid by N2 extrusion in anti&#8208;(E,E)&#8208; and anti&#8208;(Z,Z)&#8208;conformation that can be photochemically interconverted. In matrix isolation pyrolysis experiments with 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid, glycine imine cannot be trapped as it further decarboxylates to aminomethylene. In aqueous solution glycine imine is hydrolyzed to hydroxy glycine and hydrated glyoxylic acid. At higher concentrations or in the presence of FeIISO4 as a reducing agent glycine imine undergoes self&#8208;reduction by oxidative decarboxylation chemistry. Glycine imine may be seen as one of the key reaction intermediates connecting prebiotic amino acid and sugar formation chemistry.

         <title>Photochemical Processes of Superbase Generation in Xanthone Carboxylic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics and photochemistry of XnAA&#8208;TBD photobase generator are described along with the rate constants of intersystem crossing and internal conversion underlying the release of TBD by a photodecarboxylation process occurring from T2 with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol&#8208;Michael, thiol&#8208;isocyanate, and ring&#8208;opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. The effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release was demonstrated. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated C60 molecules are encapsulated in a Zr&#8208;based NU&#8208;901 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to obtain a C60@NU&#8208;901 composite. Host&#8208;guest interactions amplify the irregular charge distribution of the system, giving rise to an enhanced built&#8208;in electric field that promotes efficient charge separation and transportation of carriers. The composite mediates photocatalytic H2 production under visible light.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be 10.7&#8197;times higher in C60@NU&#8208;901 than that found in NU&#8208;901. In the catalyst, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites constructed on Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov catalysts facilitate the PMS adsorption and faster electron transfer through the side&#8208;on adsorption of the O&#8722;O bond, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to generate more SO4.&#8722; and &#8901;OH rapidly, and enabling excellent degradation of refractory organic pollutants.







Abstract
Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remains a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8722;Ov&#8722;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8722;O bond (Cu&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8722;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increase the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8722;O bond for generating more SO4&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8&#8197;times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.

         <title>Discovery of Potent and Exquisitely Selective Inhibitors of Kinase CK1 with Tunable Isoform Selectivity</title>

Newly identified chemical biology probes MU1250, MU1500, and MU1742, based on the 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole scaffold, allow for highly specific targeting of the isoforms CK1&#945;, CK1&#948;, and CK1&#1013; in cells as well as in vivo. Our observations suggest that the central scaffold can be used more broadly in compounds targeting other protein kinases, as evidenced by the highly selective p38&#945; inhibitor MU1299.







Abstract
Casein kinases 1 (CK1) are key signaling molecules that have emerged recently as attractive therapeutic targets in particular for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Herein, we report the identification of a new class of potent and highly selective inhibitors of CK1&#945;, &#948; and &#1013;. Based on their optimal in vitro and in vivo profiles and their exclusive selectivity, MU1250, MU1500 and MU1742 were selected as quality chemical probes for those CK1 isoforms. At proper concentrations, MU1250 and MU1500 allow for specific targeting of CK1&#948; or dual inhibition of CK1&#948;/&#1013; in cells. The compound MU1742 also efficiently inhibits CK1&#945; and, to our knowledge, represents the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrate that the central 1H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine&#8208;imidazole pharmacophore can be used as the basis of highly selective inhibitors of other therapeutically relevant protein kinases, e.g. p38&#945;, as exemplified by the compound MU1299.

         <title>Multicolor Chromism from a Single Chromophore through Synergistic Coupling of Mechanochromic and Photochromic Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bis&#8208;mechanophore featuring light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism has been developed, by synergistically coupling the mechanochromic and photochromic subunits (bis&#8208;rhodamine and bisthienylethene) into one chromophore. Consecutively and/or orthogonally triggered mechanochemical and photochemical reactions of the chromophore&#8208;centered polymers enabled vividly detectable, multicolor switches and gradient optical responses.







Abstract
We report a versatile mechanophore exhibiting a vividly detectable, light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism. Such optical features rely on the synergistic coupling of mechanochromic bis&#8208;rhodamine (Rh) and photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE). Poly(methyl acrylate)s incorporating this bis&#8208;mechanophore can be mechanically activated under sonication. The relative distribution of the two distinctly colored and fluorescent Rh ring&#8208;opening products is altered with different magnitudes of applied force. Orthogonal use of the photochromic reaction of the BTE core can strengthen the mechanochromism and gate the mechanofluorescence in polymers. Due to increased conjugation offered by the BTE linker, both force&#8208; and light&#8208;induced optical signals display high contrast. Combined DFT simulated and experimental results reveal that the three subunits (two Rhs and one BTE) in this chromophore are activated sequentially, thus generating switchable three&#8208;colored forms and gradient optical responses.

         <title>Leveraging Crystalline and Amorphous States of a Metal&#8208;Organic Complex for Transformation of the Photosalient Effect and Positive&#8208;Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex in order to tune negative and positive photochromism was proposed, which could be assigned to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, both polymorphs exhibit mechanochromic photoemission, and lead to the on/off toggling of the light&#8208;driven motion of bulky molecular crystals.







Abstract
Uncovering differences between crystalline and amorphous states in molecular solids would both promote the understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships, as well as inform development of multi&#8208;functional materials based on the same compound. Herein, for the first time, we report an approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex, which exhibited negative and positive photochromism, due to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, different polymorphs lead to the on/off toggling of photo&#8208;burst movement (photosalient effect), indicating the controllable light&#8208;mechanical conversion. Three demos were further constructed to support their application in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of a state&#8208; and polymorph&#8208;dependent photochemical route, paving an effective way for the design of new dynamically responsive systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Far&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Driven Photolysis via Triplet Fusion to Enhance Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) system, consisting of a BODIPY photosensitizer and a perylene prodrug (PyCl), released an anti&#8208;cancer drug upon far&#8208;red light irradiation. Encapsulation of this TFP system and a 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor within a nanoparticle enabled far&#8208;red light&#8208;promoted checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for effective inhibition of both local and metastatic tumors under extremely low excitation (20&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven prodrug photoactivation is highly desirable for applications such as neuromodulation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. Herein, via triplet fusion, we report on the far&#8208;red light&#8208;driven photo&#8208;release of an anti&#8208;cancer drug by coupling the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer with a photocleavable perylene&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer drug. Notably, this metal&#8208;free triplet fusion photolysis (TFP) strategy can be further advanced by incorporating an additional functional dopant, i.e. an immunotherapy medicine inhibiting the indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO), with the far&#8208;red responsive triplet fusion pair in an air&#8208;stable nanoparticle. With this IDO inhibitor&#8208;assisted TFP system we observed efficient inhibition of primary and distant tumors in a mouse model at record&#8208;low excitation power, compared to other photo&#8208;assisted immunotherapy approaches. This metal&#8208;free TFP strategy will spur advancement in photonics and biophotonics fields.

         <title>Structural Fusion Yields Guest Acceptors that Enable Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 18.77&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the novel asymmetric guest acceptor was rationally designed by combining the structural fusion and unidirectional extension strategies. The optimized ternary device with the incorporation of this guest acceptor achieved considerably improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.77&#8201;% with a boosted open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.896&#8197;V.







Abstract
The design and selection of a suitable guest acceptor are particularly important for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we designed and successfully synthesized two asymmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen bridged guest acceptors, which featured distinct blue&#8208;shifted absorption, upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, and larger dipole moments than symmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen&#8208;bridged acceptor. Ternary devices with the incorporation of 14.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% these two asymmetric guest acceptors exhibited excellent performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.22&#8201;% and 18.77&#8201;%, respectively. Our success in precise control of material properties via structural fusion of five&#8208;membered carbon linkages and six&#8208;membered silicon&#8211;oxygen connection at the central electron&#8208;donating core unit of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors can attract considerable attention and bring new vigor and vitality for developing new materials toward more efficient OSCs.

Ternary devices with the incorporation of 14.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% these two asymmetric guest acceptors exhibited excellent performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.22&#8201;% and 18.77&#8201;%, respectively. Our success in precise control of material properties via structural fusion of five-membered carbon linkages and six-membered silicon&#8211;oxygen connection at the central electron-donating core unit of fused-ring electron acceptors can attract considerable attention and bring new vigor and vitality for developing new materials toward more efficient OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Annulated Azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives and their 4,5&#8208;dihydro analogues have been prepared in four synthetic steps or less from commercially available compounds. These molecules exhibit high molar absorption coefficients in the visible region and good charge transport properties in field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogues. However, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with band gap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14&#8197;eV and molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;) of nearly 3&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring currents (aromatic), as supported by 1H NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values of up to 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Hydrogenation of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Lactams Enabled by Switching the N&#8208;Chirality of Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented N&#8208;stereogenic center playing an impressive role in the iridium/Rong&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;divergent asymmetric hydrogenation was observed. Rong&#8208;Phos is easily prepared from readily available starting materials, which selectively form two diastereoisomeric Ir&#8208;complexes with fixed N&#8208;chirality depending on the coordination conditions.







Abstract
Central chirality is an important chiral element used in the design of chiral ligands and catalysts. Mostly, the attention of organic chemists is focused on developing of chiral ligands with stable stereogenic centers. However, the N&#8208;chirality in chiral ligand design has been rarely explored due to its flexibility. Here we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and application of a class of simple P,N&#8208;ligands with flexible N&#8208;chirality and their derived iridium complexes with fixed N&#8208;chiral stereocenters. Both fixed configurations of the N&#8208;stereocenter of the iridium complexes could be selectively formed from the same chiral ligand. This pair of diastereoisomeric iridium complexes showed good performance in the enantiodivergent asymmetric hydrogenation of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated lactams. The N&#8722;H group plays an impressive role in catalytic activity. Computational studies emphasized the importance of N&#8208;chirality and N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a newly developed SPSiOL&#8208;base bisphosphite ligand (SPSiPO), Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes was realized for the first time, delivering the enantioenriched allylsilanes bearing a tertiary carbon stereocenter in high efficiency and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economy with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Here, we report the first example of Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with high level of regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. The key to achieve this stereoselective hydrosilylation reaction was the development of the SPSiOL&#8208;derived bisphosphite ligands (SPSiPO). This protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent functional group, and heterocycle tolerance, thus provides a versatile method for the construction of enantioenriched tertiary allylsilanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economic manner. DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity.

         <dc:description>
A new CO2 based cascade process has been developed towards pharmaceutically relevant benzoxazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. The process is empowered by a Ag&#8208;catalyst and shows appreciable structural scope for these target molecules. Mechanistic data and controls are in line with a unique, sequential process that builds on the formation of a five&#8208;membered carbonate intercepted by an N&#8208;centered nucleophile thereby forging a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate.







Abstract
A conceptually novel catalytic domino approach is presented for the synthesis of highly functional 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzoxazine&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. Key to the chemoselectivity is a proper design of the precursor to override thermodynamically favored parasitic cyclization processes and empower the formation of the desired product through Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effects. The synthetic diversity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles is further demonstrated, and the isolation of a reaction intermediate supports an unusual ring&#8208;expansion sequence from an &#945;&#8208;alkylidene, five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate to a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate by N&#8208;induced isomerization.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Classification for the Prediction of Catalytic Activity of Organic Photosensitizers in the Nickel(II)&#8208;Salt&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the synthesis of phenols with an inorganic nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer has been developed, together with machine&#8208;learning models to predict the catalytic activity of organic photosensitizers. An investigation into the effect of the descriptors clarified that inputting both physical and structural properties of the organic photosensitizers contributes to the construction of robust machine&#8208;learning models.







Abstract
Catalytic systems using a small amount of organic photosensitizer for the activation of an inorganic (on&#8208;demand ligand&#8208;free) nickel(II) salt represent a cost&#8208;effective method for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while C(sp2)&#8722;O bond formation remains less developed. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of phenols with a nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer, which was identified via an investigation into the catalytic activity of 60 organic photosensitizers consisting of various electron donor and acceptor moieties. To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT&#8208; and RDKit&#8208;derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8220;precision&#8221; and &#8220;recall&#8221; across a wide range of search space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy for the synthesis of phenols with an inorganic nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer has been developed, together with machine-learning models to predict the catalytic activity of organic photosensitizers. An investigation into the effect of the descriptors clarified that inputting both physical and structural properties of the organic photosensitizers contributes to the construction of robust machine-learning models.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Bi Nanosheets Promote CO2&#8901;&#8722; Formation for High&#8208;Performance and pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a rational electronic structure manipulation strategy, electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets are obtained. Compared to electron&#8208;neutral Bi, the electron&#8208;rich Bi favors the formation of CO2.&#8722; intermediate to activate CO2 molecules, thus leading to its superior electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemical fuels such as formate offers a promising pathway to carbon&#8208;neutral future, but its practical application is largely inhibited by the lack of effective activation of CO2 molecules and pH&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we report an electronic structure manipulation strategy to electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets, where electrons transfer from Cu donor to Bi acceptor in bimetallic Cu&#8722;Bi, enabling CO2RR towards formate with concurrent high activity, selectivity and stability in pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral and alkaline) electrolytes. Combined in situ Raman spectra and computational calculations unravel that electron&#8208;rich Bi promotes CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation to activate CO2 molecules, and enhance the adsorption strength of *OCHO intermediate with an up&#8208;shifted p&#8208;band center, thus leading to its superior activity and selectivity of formate. Further integration of the robust electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets into III&#8211;V&#8208;based photovoltaic solar cell results in an unassisted artificial leaf with a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate (STF) efficiency of 13.7&#8201;%.

         <title>Stainless Steel&#8208;Like Passivation Inspires Persistent Silicon Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional bulk&#8208;passivated and surface&#8208;coated Si films were developed to mitigate volume expansion of Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and study the stainless steel&#8208;like passivation mechanism by various characterizations.







Abstract
Passivation of stainless steel by additives forming mass&#8208;transport blocking layers is widely practiced, where Cr element is added into bulk Fe&#8722;C forming the Cr2O3&#8208;rich protective layer. Here we extend the long&#8208;practiced passivation concept to Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, incorporating the passivator of LiF/Li2CO3 into bulk Si. The passivation mechanism is studied by various ex situ characterizations, redox peak contour maps, thickness evolution tests, and finite element simulations. The results demonstrate that the passivation can enhance the (de)lithiation of Li&#8208;Si alloys, induce the formation of F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, stabilize the Si/LiF/Li2CO3 composite, and mitigate the volume change of Si anodes upon cycling. The 3D passivated Si anode can fully retain a high capacity of 3701&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and tolerate high rates up to 50C. This work provides insight into how to construct durable Si anodes through effective passivation.

         <title>A Molybdenum Disulfide Nanozyme with Charge&#8208;Enhanced Activity for Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Ferroptosis</title>

         <dc:description>
An acidic tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented that is made from few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA). The charge&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity, pH&#8208;responsive CA release&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, and glutathione depletion enable out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis.







Abstract
The deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes and insufficient endogenous H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are major obstacles for nanozyme&#8208;mediated catalytic tumor therapy. Since electron transfer is the basic essence of catalysis&#8208;mediated redox reactions, we explored the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on positive and negative charges, which are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to enhance the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of a MoS2 nanozyme. Hence, an acidic tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented that is made from few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA).

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered metal organic framework (MOF) cubosomes with a single primitive bicontinuous structure by using polymer cubosomes as the template, and also investigated their growth mechanism and kinetics as well as potential proteolysis application.







Abstract
We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im
m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm
m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65&#8197;nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n=3 and a growth rate of k=1.33&#215;10&#8722;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.

Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF-8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Thioketonates: A New Class of S,O&#8208;Chelated Boranes as Acceptors in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of tetra&#8208;coordinated boranes namely boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates, analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones, which exhibit outstanding bulk electron mobility, photoresponse and tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type semiconductors with tunable band gap and dielectric constant has significant implication in dissociating bound charge carrier relevant for demonstrating high performance optoelectronic devices. Boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates (MTDKB), analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones were synthesized. Bulk transport measurement exhibited an outstanding bulk electron mobility of &#8776;0.003&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is among the best values reported till date in these class of semiconducting materials and correspondingly a single junction photo responsivity of upto 6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 was obtained. This new family of O,S&#8208;chelated boron compounds exhibited luminescence in the far red/near&#8208;infrared region. The remarkable red shift of 89&#8197;nm (fluorescence) observed for 4&#8201;a in comparison with analogues boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonate signifies the importance of sulfur in these molecules. MTDKBs with amine functionality have also been investigated as an ON/OFF fluorescent sensor.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Electrooxidative Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H Annulation with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins (up to 99&#8201;% ee) using tBu&#8208;Salox as chiral ligand. The cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Mechanistic studies provided insights into the mechanism of this reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and poses a daunting challenge. Herein, we report the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins using an undivided cell at room temperature (up to 99&#8201;% ee). tBu&#8208;Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky tert&#8208;butyl group at the ortho&#8208;position of phenol, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect between tBu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins without secondary bond interactions (up to 96&#8201;% ee and 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, and the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.

Small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 with high chemomechanical reliability is constructed, and exhibits high&#8208;rate capacities, long&#8208;duration life, and low thermal activity under highly delithiated states for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance Li&#8208;ion batteries as competitive cathodes.







Abstract
High voltage can cost&#8208;effectively boost energy density of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but compromises their mechanical, electrochemical and thermal&#8208;driven stability. Herein, a collaborative strategy (i.e., small single&#8208;crystal design and hetero&#8208;atom doping) is devised to construct a chemomechanically reliable small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (SS&#8208;MN6) operating stably under high voltage (&#8805;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). The substantially reduced particle size combined with Mo6+ doping absorbs accumulated localized stress to eradicate cracks formation, subdues the surface side reactions and lattice oxygen missing meanwhile, and improves thermal tolerance at highly delithiated state. Consequently, the SS&#8208;MN6 based pouch cells are endowed with striking deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance capability. The contribution here provides a promising way to construct advanced cathodes with superb chemomechanical stability for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Highly Reactive Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkylsodium Reagents for Benzylic Aroylation of Toluenes using Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting coordination effects to prepare hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble alkyl organosodium reagents enables the efficient metalation of toluene derivatives under mild and stoichiometric conditions, and their facile conversion into 2&#8208;arylacetophenones. Through the isolation of key organometallic intermediates and their study in solution, new mechanistic insights have been gained into these sodium&#8208;mediated reactions.







Abstract
Deaggregating the alkyl sodium NaCH2SiMe3 with polydentate nitrogen ligands enables the preparation and characterisation of new, hydrocarbon soluble chelated alkylsodium reagents. Equipped with significantly enhanced metalating power over their organolithium counterparts, these systems can promote controlled sodiation of weakly acidic benzylic C&#8722;H bonds from a series of toluene derivatives under mild stoichiometric conditions. This has been demonstrated through the benzylic aroylation of toluenes with Weinreb amides, that delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;arylacetophenones in good to excellent yields. Success in isolating and determining the structures of key organometallic intermediates has provided useful mechanistic insight into these new sodium&#8208;mediated transformations.

         <title>A &#8220;Pre&#8208;Division Metal Clusters&#8221; Strategy to Mediate Efficient Dual&#8208;Active Sites ORR Catalyst for Ultralong Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>

A &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is first conceived to fabricate dual&#8208;active center catalysts (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500) with dispersed CoN4 and Co2P sites. The optimal catalyst executes superior ORR activity and was applied in ultralong Zn&#8208;air batteries surpassing the benchmark 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the dual&#8208;active sites synergistically quicken the formation of the *OOH intermediate, greatly boosting the performance.







Abstract
To conquer the bottleneck of sluggish kinetics in cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal&#8208;air batteries, catalysts with dual&#8208;active centers have stood out. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is firstly conceived to fabricate a N,S&#8208;dual doped honeycomb&#8208;like carbon matrix inlaid with CoN4 sites and wrapped Co2P nanoclusters as dual&#8208;active centers (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500). A crystalline {CoII2} coordination cluster divided by periphery second organic layers is well&#8208;designed to realize delocalized dispersion before calcination. The optimal Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 executes excellent 4e&#8722; ORR activity surpassing the benchmark Pt/C. Theoretical calculation results reveal that the CoN4 sites and Co2P nanoclusters can synergistically quicken the formation of *OOH on Co sites. The rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) assembled by Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 delivers ultralong cycling stability over 1742&#8197;hours (3484&#8197;cycles) under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can light up a 2.4&#8197;V LED bulb for &#8776;264&#8197;hours, evidencing the promising practical application potentials in portable devices.

         <title>Speed Tuning of the Formation/Dissociation of a Metallorotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallorotaxane with a tunable formation/dissociation speed has been synthesized by the complexation of a triptycene&#8208;based dumbbell&#8208;shaped mononuclear complex with a crown ether derivative. The inertness of the Pd2+&#8208;phenylenediamine coordination structure allows the metallorotaxane to be slowly but quantitatively generated, with the speed of formation increased up to 27&#8197;times simply by adding an accelerator such as Br&#8722;.







Abstract
Switching between the formation/dissociation of rotaxanes is important to control the function of various types of rotaxane&#8208;based materials. We have developed a convenient and simple strategy, the so&#8208;called &#8220;accelerator addition&#8221;, to make a static rotaxane dynamic without apparently affecting the chemical structure. As an interlocked molecule that enables tuning of the formation/dissociation speed, a metallorotaxane was quantitatively generated by the complexation of a triptycene&#8208;based dumbbell&#8208;shaped mononuclear complex, [PdL2]2+ (L=2,3&#8208;diaminotriptycene), with 27C9. As a result of the inertness of the Pd2+&#8208;based coordination structure, the metallorotaxane was slowly formed (the static state). This rotaxane formation was accelerated 27&#8197;times simply by adding Br&#8722; as an accelerator (the dynamic state). A similar drastic acceleration was also demonstrated during the dissociation process when Cs+ was added to the metallorotaxane to form the free axle [PdL2]2+ and the 27C9&#8208;Cs+ complex.

         <title>Electrocrystallization Regulation Enabled Stacked Hexagonal Platelet Growth toward Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A control mechanism of electrolyte on zinc electrocrystallization is proposed and validated through cyclic and linear sulfone cosolvents. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) formed by vertical dipole array is able to convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface, steering conformal stratiform Zn growth and preferred orientation of Zn electrocrystallization.







Abstract
Realizing durative flattened and dendrite&#8208;free zinc (Zn) metal configuration is the key to resolving premature battery failure caused by the internal short circuit, which is highly determined by the crystal growth in the electrocrystallization process. Herein, we report that regulating the molecular structure of the inner Helmholtz plane (HIP) can effectively convert the deposition into activation control by weakening the solvated ion adsorption at the interface. The moderated electrochemical reaction kinetics lower than the adatom self&#8208;diffusion rate steers conformal stratiform Zn growth and dominant Zn (0001) texture, achieving crystallographic optimization. Through in situ mediation of electrolyte engineering, orientational plating and stripping behaviors at edge&#8208;sites and tailored solvation structure immensely improve the utilization efficiency and total charge passed of Zn metal, even under extreme conditions, including high areal capacity (3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Simultaneous Stabilization of Lithium Anode and Cathode using Hyperconjugative Electrolytes for High&#8208;voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule descriptors proposed in this work guide a bottom&#8208;up hyperconjugative electrolyte design, which exhibits superior stability for both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode; and enables the 4.6&#8197;V Li||LCO full cell (30&#8197;&#956;m Li, 4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 LCO, low N/P ratio of 1.3) to display great performance improvement. The bottom&#8208;up electrolyte design concept opens up a universal strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Although great progress has been made in new electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the intrinsic relationship between electrolyte composition and cell performance remains unclear due to the lack of valid quantization method. Here, we proposed the concept of negative center of electrostatic potential (NCESP) and Mayer bond order (MBO) to describe solvent capability, which highly relate to solvation structure and oxidation potential, respectively. Based on established principles, the selected electrolyte with 1.7&#8197;M LiFSI in methoxytrimethylsilane (MOTMS)/ (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFMTMS) shows unique hyperconjugation nature to stabilize both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode. The 4.6&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m Li||4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (low N/P ratio of 1.3) cell with our electrolyte shows stable cycling with 91&#8201;% capacity retention over 200&#8197;cycles. The bottom&#8208;up design concept of electrolyte opens up a general strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages with Internally and Externally Engineered Exosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of internally and externally engineered exosomes (I3E) was constructed with the CRISPR interference system internally engineered, and the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;specific peptide externally engineered. I3E enabled to in situ reprogram the M2 TAMs to M1 by inactivating PI3K&#947; completely, which awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity and inhibited tumor growth significantly.







Abstract
The reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as an efficient strategy for immunotherapy. However, most of the approaches did not allow the in situ reprogramming of TAM because their low efficiency, non&#8208;specificity, or potential side effects. Herein, we produced exosomes with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) internally engineered and the TAM specific peptide externally engineered onto the exosome membrane. The internally and externally engineered exosomes (IEEE, also named as I3E) allowed the selective homing to tumor tissue and targeted to M2&#8208;like TAMs, which nearly repressed the expression of PI&#8208;3 kinase gamma (PI3K&#947;) completely, and induced the TAMs polarizing to M1 both in vitro and in vivo. The polarized M1 macrophages awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity, causing the increase of T lymphocyte infiltration and the decrease of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and inhibiting the tumor growth significantly. I3E reprogramed TAMs in situ precisely and efficiently.

         <title>Organometallic Borromean Rings and [2]Catenanes Featuring Di&#8208;NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvophobic effects have been shown to play a crucial role in the formation and stability of a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene complexes. The stability of the interlocked species in solution is related to the lengths of the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the benzobiscarbene linkers, with longer N&#8208;alkyl substituents improving the stability of the BRs and enhancing the proportion of [2]catenanes in solution.







Abstract
We report herein a series of organometallic Borromean rings (BRs) and [2]catenanes prepared from benzobiscarbene ligands. The reaction of dinickel complexes of the benzobiscarbenes 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c with a thiazolothiazole bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 led by self&#8208;assembly to a series of organometallic BRs. Solvophobic effects played a crucial role in the formation and stability of the interlocked species. The stability of BRs is related to the N&#8208;alkyl substituents at the precursors 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, where longer alkyl substitutes improve stability and inter&#8208;ring interactions. Solvophobic effects are also important for the stability of [2]catenanes prepared from 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c and a flexible bipyridyl ligand L3. In solution, an equilibrium between the [2]catenanes and their macrocyclic building blocks was observed. High proportions of [2]catenanes were obtained in concentrated solutions or polar solvents. The proportion of [2]catenanes in solution could be further enhanced by lengthening of the N&#8208;alkyl substitutes.

</title>

         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free tightly&#8208;twisted single&#8208;handed helical tubular ladder polymers with a highly &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized thorough the quantitative and chemoselective helical ladderization of the rationally&#8208;designed precursor polymers. The resulting helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities.







Abstract
Defect&#8208;free one&#8208;handed contracted helical tubular ladder polymers with a &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized by alkyne benzannulations of the random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing 6,6&#8242;&#8208;linked&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;based chiral monomer units. The resulting tightly&#8208;twisted helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities. The random&#8208;coil precursor polymer and analogous rigid&#8208;rod extended helical ribbon&#8208;like ladder polymer with no internal helical cavity exhibited no resolution abilities. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity formed in the tightly&#8208;twisted tubular helical ladder structures is of key importance for producing the highly&#8208;enantioseparation ability, by which chiral aromatics can be enantioselectively encapsulated by specific &#960;&#8208;&#960; and/or hydrophobic interactions.

         <title>Concerted and Selective Electrooxidation of Polyethylene&#8208;Terephthalate&#8208;Derived Alcohol to Glycolic Acid at an Industry&#8208;Level Current Density over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Concerted and selective electro&#8208;reforming of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into high&#8208;value glycolic acid and H2 fuel was achieved at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) by a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved in a flow electrolyzer, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of Polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into fine chemicals and H2 is an ideal solution to address severe plastic pollution. Here, we report the electrooxidation of EG to glycolic acid (GA) with a high Faraday efficiency and selectivity (&gt;85&#8201;%) even at an industry&#8208;level current density (600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.15&#8197;V vs. RHE) over a Pd&#8722;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200&#8197;h can be achieved, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that 1)&#8197;the OH* generation promoted by Ni(OH)2 plays a critical role in facilitating EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA oxidation and removing poisonous carbonyl species, thereby achieving high activity and stability; 2)&#8197;Pd with a downshifted d&#8208;band center and the oxophilic Ni can synergistically facilitate the rapid desorption and transfer of GA from the active Pd sites to the inactive Ni sites, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and thus achieving high selectivity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carboxylation of C&#8722;N Bonds in Cyclic Amines with CO2 by Consecutive Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 is realized by consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). This mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol provides a general and practical route to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#1013;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is realized by consecutive photo-induced electron transfer (ConPET). This mild and transition-metal-free protocol provides a general and practical route to valuable &#946;-, &#947;-, &#948;- and &#1013;-amino acids.

A two&#8208;dimensional vertically conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu)) was designed and synthesized with a hexahydroxyltriptycene ligand, which features a vertically extended structure. The 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency improvement compared to the planarly extended 2D conductive MOFs, displaying the potential of the structural design in the catalytic performance enhancement.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structures and physical&#8208;chemical properties. However, the planarly extended structure of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs usually limited the accessibility of the active sites. Herein, we designed a triptycene&#8208;based 2D vertically conductive MOF (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF) by coordinating 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexahydroxyltriptycene (HHTC) with Cu2+. The vertically extended 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) possesses a weak interlayer interaction, which leads to a facile exfoliation to the nanosheet. Compared with the classical 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs with planarly extended 2D structures, 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a 100&#8201;% increased catalytic activity in terms of turnover number and a two&#8208;fold increased selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that higher activity originated from the lower energy barriers of the vertically extended 2D structures during the CO2 reduction reaction process.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production via Selective Two&#8208;electron Mild Electrochemical Oxidation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines Completely to Dihydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines to high&#8208;valued&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines can promote hydrogen production with maximum efficiency, compared with the high energy consumption of four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines.







Abstract
Different from the previous study that biomass derivatives replace water oxidation for enhancing hydrogen production, we found that mild oxidation was more conductive to cathodic hydrogen production. In this study, maximum Faradaic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and lower energy consumption for hydrogen production was achieved by precisely controlling the two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) in place of the four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines (IQs). Moreover, the high value&#8208;added DHIQs were prepared from THIQs with high selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) at the low potential of 1.36&#8197;V. Operando electrochemical Raman and density functional theory proved that the high selectivity was attributed to the regulable active species of NiOOH induced by the interaction of Co and Fe for preferentially breaking C&#8722;H bond rather than N&#8722;H of THIQs. This novel method provides important insight into efficient biomass&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PD&#8208;L1 and Activation of the STING Pathway by Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based PROTACs for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been developed to recognize and bind programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) distributed in tumor cells and recruit the cereblon (CRBN) for PD&#8208;L1 degradation. These nanosized PROTACs can efficiently accumulate at the tumor site and activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to augmented cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease&#8208;associated proteins. Here, we report carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based PROTACs (CDTACs) that degrade membrane proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD&#8208;L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99&#8201;% or 90&#8201;% of PD&#8208;L1 in CT26 or B16&#8208;F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16&#8208;F10 tumors. Compared with small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cell Using a Fluoride&#8208;Assisted Surface Gradient Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency is achieved for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cell via a surface gradient passivation strategy. It is found that increasing the distance between F and &#8722;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can enhance the electropositivity of &#8722;NH3+, thus providing strong adsorption onto the IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the p&#8208;FPEAI (para&#8208;Fluorophenylethylammonium Iodide) modified device affords a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63&#8201;%.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;band gap (1.68&#8197;eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important components of perovskite/Si tandem devices. However, the efficiency of wide band gap PSCs has been limited by their huge open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficit due to non&#8208;radiative recombination. Deep&#8208;level acceptor defects are identified as the major killers of Voc, and they can be effectively improved by passivation with ammonium salts. Theoretical calculation predicts that increasing the distance between F and &#8722;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can dramatically enhance the electropositivity of &#8722;NH3+ terminals, thus providing strong adsorption onto the negatively charged IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects. Characterizations further confirm that surface gradient passivation employing p&#8208;FPEAI demonstrates the most efficient passivation effect. Consequently, a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63&#8201;% with the smallest Voc deficit of 441&#8197;mV is achieved for 1.68&#8197;eV&#8208;band gap inverted PSCs. Additionally, a flexible PSC and 1&#8197;cm2 opaque device also deliver the highest PCEs of 21.02&#8201;% and 19.31&#8201;%, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Wide-band gap (1.68&#8197;eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important components of perovskite/Si tandem devices. However, the efficiency of wide band gap PSCs has been limited by their huge open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) deficit due to non-radiative recombination. Deep-level acceptor defects are identified as the major killers of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;, and they can be effectively improved by passivation with ammonium salts. Theoretical calculation predicts that increasing the distance between F and &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of fluorinated ammonium can dramatically enhance the electropositivity of &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; terminals, thus providing strong adsorption onto the negatively charged I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;Pb&lt;/sub&gt; anti-site defects. Characterizations further confirm that surface gradient passivation employing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-FPEAI demonstrates the most efficient passivation effect. Consequently, a record-efficiency of 21.63&#8201;% with the smallest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; deficit of 441&#8197;mV is achieved for 1.68&#8197;eV-band gap inverted PSCs. Additionally, a flexible PSC and 1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; opaque device also deliver the highest PCEs of 21.02&#8201;% and 19.31&#8201;%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;C bond formation and complete N=N bond rupture in azobenzenes was induced by a heterosiloxane&#8208;type frustrated POSi Lewis pair; the reactivity resembles that of the acid initiated classical benzidine rearrangement, but starting from an N=N double&#8208;bonded system.







Abstract
The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (2) with azobenzene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by cleavage of the N&#8722;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen atoms and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R=Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrangement was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

The binary iron arsenide cluster, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, contains a triangular Fe3 core with short Fe&#8722;Fe bonds.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis and structural characterization of the first binary iron arsenide cluster anion, [Fe3(As3)3(As4)]3&#8722;, present in both [K([2.2.2]crypt)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)] (1) and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]3[Fe3(As3)3(As4)]&#8901;en (2). The cluster contains an Fe3 triangle with three short Fe&#8722;Fe bond lengths (2.494(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.459(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.668(2)&#8197;&#197; for 1, 2.471(1)&#8197;&#197;, 2.473(1)&#8197;&#197; and 2.660(1)&#8197;&#197; for 2), bridged by a 2&#8208;butene&#8208;like As4 unit. An analysis of the electronic structure using DFT reveals a triplet ground state with direct Fe&#8722;Fe bonds stabilizing the Fe3 core.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Reactions of the Cyaphide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe three distinct oligomerization reactions of metal complexes bonded to the cyaphide ligand (CP&#8722;). Reductive coupling of a gold cyaphido complex was found to afford a species containing a C2P24&#8722; dimer. By contrast, sterically unprotected metal complexes with more polar M&#8722;CP (M=Ni, Sc) bonds were found to spontaneously oligomerize giving rise to species with bridging C2P22&#8722; and C3P33&#8722; ligands.







Abstract
The cyaphide anion, CP&#8722;, is shown to undergo three distinct oligomerization reactions in the coordination sphere of metals. Reductive coupling of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) by Sm(Cp*)2(OEt2) (Cp*=1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), was found to afford a tetra&#8208;metallic complex containing a 2,3&#8208;diphosphabutadiene&#8208;1,1,4,4&#8208;tetraide fragment. By contrast, non&#8208;reductive dimerization of Ni(SIDipp)(Cp)(CP) (SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; Cp=cyclopentadienyl), gives rise to an asymmetric bimetallic complex containing a 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide moiety. Spontaneous trimerization of Sc(Cp*)2(CP) results in the formation of a trimetallic complex containing a 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triide fragment. These transformations show that while cyaphido transition metal complexes can be readily accessed using metathesis reactions, many such species are unstable to further oligomerization processes.

         <title>An Aluminum Telluride with a Terminal Al=Te Bond and its Conversion to an Aluminum Tellurocarbonate by CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile isolation of various dimeric aluminum selenides and tellurides, as well as an aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer featuring a terminal Al=Te bond, is reported. The aluminum&#8208;telluride monomer exhibits high thermal stability and reacts with three equivalents of CO2 to form an unprecedented tellurocarbonate [CO2Te]2&#8722; substituted aluminum complex, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of the carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.







Abstract
Facile access to dimeric heavier aluminum chalcogenides [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 (NHC=IiPr (1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene); Tipp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; Ch=Se, Te) by treatment of NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminum dihydrides with elemental Se and Te is reported. The higher affinity of IMe4 in comparison with IiPr toward the Al center in [(NHC)Al(Tipp)&#8208;&#956;&#8208;Ch]2 can be used for ligand exchange. Additionally, the presence of excess IMe4 allows for cleavage of the dimers to form a rare example of a neutral multiply bonded heavier aluminum chalcogenide in the form of a tetracoordinate aluminum complex, (IMe4)2(Tipp)Al=Te. This species reacts with three equivalents of CO2 across two Al&#8722;CNHC and the Al=Te bond affording a pentacoordinate aluminum complex containing a dianionic tellurocarbonate ligand [CO2Te]2&#8722;, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of a carbonate [CO3]2&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;Facile isolation of various dimeric aluminum selenides and tellurides, as well as an aluminum-telluride monomer featuring a terminal Al=Te bond, is reported. The aluminum-telluride monomer exhibits high thermal stability and reacts with three equivalents of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form an unprecedented tellurocarbonate [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; substituted aluminum complex, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of the carbonate [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facile access to dimeric heavier aluminum chalcogenides [(NHC)Al(Tipp)-&#956;-Ch]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NHC=I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr (1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene, IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazol-2-ylidene); Tipp=2,4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Ch=Se, Te) by treatment of NHC-stabilized aluminum dihydrides with elemental Se and Te is reported. The higher affinity of IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison with I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr toward the Al center in [(NHC)Al(Tipp)-&#956;-Ch]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be used for ligand exchange. Additionally, the presence of excess IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; allows for cleavage of the dimers to form a rare example of a neutral multiply bonded heavier aluminum chalcogenide in the form of a tetracoordinate aluminum complex, (IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Tipp)Al=Te. This species reacts with three equivalents of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; across two Al&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt; and the Al=Te bond affording a pentacoordinate aluminum complex containing a dianionic tellurocarbonate ligand [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the first example of tellurium analogue of a carbonate [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning on the Antimicrobial Activity of Gold Nanoclusters Against Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria

The addition of thiourea enabled the broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive gold nanoclusters against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
In this work, we show that the addition of thiourea (TU) initiated broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive D&#8208;maltose&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNC&#8208;Mal). For example, AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was effective against multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (2.5&#8197;&#956;M [Au]) while having 30&#8211;60&#8197;times lower in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The reaction of AuNC&#8208;Mal and TU generated the antimicrobial species of [Au(TU)2]+ and smaller AuNCs. TU increased the accumulation of Au in bacteria and helped maintain the oxidation state as AuI (vs. AuIII). The modes of action included the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, interference with the CuI regulation and depletion of ATP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity did not change in the presence of colistin or carbonyl cyanide 3&#8208;chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was indifferent to the outer membrane barrier and to bacterial efflux pumps.

         <title>Pyridine Dimers and Their Low&#8208;Temperature Isomerization: A High&#8208;Resolution Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy Study</title>

High&#8208;resolution IR spectra in Ne matrices in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations give evidence for a hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure as lowest&#8208;energy form of the pyridine dimer.







Abstract
The bonding between two neutral aromatic compounds, especially small ones, has been controversially debated in the last decades, and terms like &#8220;&#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; had to be revised. Surprisingly, despite of many experimental and computational work, there is still no clear consensus about the structure of and the bonding in the pyridine dimer. In this work, for different isomeric forms of the pyridine dimer, the structures and bonding were elucidated by combining high&#8208;resolution matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic results with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. High&#8208;resolution IR spectra of Ne matrices at 4&#8197;K containing pyridine were recorded for different concentrations and upon annealing to 10 and 12&#8197;K, relying on three isotopologues of pyridine. The spectra show the presence of hydrogen&#8208;bonded, T&#8208;shaped, and stacked forms of weakly&#8208;bound pyridine dimers. Among these, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded isomer is identified as the lowest&#8208;energy form. The results provide for the first time conclusive information about the interaction between two pyridine dimers.

         <title>Second Sphere Effects Promote Formic Acid Dehydrogenation by a Single&#8208;Atom Gold Catalyst Supported on Amino&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold (Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) supported on amino&#8208;functionalized graphdiyne was synthesized, which displayed a fivefold higher catalytic activity than the Au SAC supported on graphdiyne. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the amino groups in the second sphere of the Au atom serve as proton relays to facilitate the H2 formation from an Au&#8722;H intermediate, thus substantially accelerating the rate of formic acid dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Regulating the second sphere of homogeneous molecular catalysts is a common and effective method to boost their catalytic activities, while the second sphere effects have rarely been investigated for heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts primarily due to the synthetic challenge for installing functional groups in their second spheres. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined and readily tailorable structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an Au single&#8208;atom catalyst on amino&#8208;substituted GDY is constructed, where the amino group is located in the second sphere of the Au center. The Au atoms on amino&#8208;decorated GDY displayed superior activity for formic acid dehydrogenation compared with those on unfunctionalized GDY. The experimental studies, particularly the proton inventory studies, and theoretical calculations revealed that the amino groups adjacent to an Au atom could serve as proton relays and thus facilitate the protonation of an intermediate Au&#8722;H to generate H2. Our study paves the way to precisely constructing the functional second sphere on single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Galvanic Redox Potentiometry for Fouling&#8208;Free and Stable Serotonin Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fouling&#8208;free, highly stable, and sensitive sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry (GRP) is presented to study serotonin dynamics in the living guinea pig brain. The GRP sensor could be used to study many other neurochemicals with similar serious fouling issues in living biosystems, promoting the understanding of brain function and neurological diseases at the molecular level.







Abstract
Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a major neurotransmitter broadly involved in many aspects of feeling and behavior. Although its electro&#8208;activity makes it a promising candidate for electrochemical sensing, the persistent generation of fouling layers on the electrode by its oxidation products presents a hurdle for reliable sensing. Here, we present a fouling&#8208;free 5&#8208;HT sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry. The sensor efficiently minimizes electrode fouling as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, ensuring a less than 3&#8201;% signal change in a 2&#8197;hour continuous experiment, whereas amperometric sensors losing 90&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min. Most importantly, the sensor is highly amenable for in vivo studies, permitting real&#8208;time 5&#8208;HT monitoring, and supporting the mechanism associated with serotonin release in brain. Our system offers an effective way for sensing different neurochemicals having significant fouling issues, thus facilitating the molecular&#8208;level understanding of brain function.

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to prepare dynamic hydrogel materials has been developed that uses a reactive and consumable chemical stimulus to temporarily upgrade host&#8211;guest affinity and drive hydrogelation. These hydrogels exist only transiently, autonomously transitioning back to a flowing suspension over time.







Abstract
The transient self&#8208;assembly of molecules under the direction of a consumable fuel source is fundamental to biological processes such as cellular organization and motility. Such biomolecular assemblies exist in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state, requiring continuous consumption of high energy molecules. At the same time, the creation of bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels has traditionally focused on associations occurring at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here, hydrogels are prepared from cucurbit[7]uril host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions through transient physical crosslinking driven by the consumption of a reactive chemical fuel. Upon action from this fuel, the affinity and dynamics of CB[7]&#8211;guest recognition are altered. In this way, the lifetime of transient hydrogel formation and the dynamic modulus obtained are governed by fuel consumption, rather than being directed by equilibrium complex formation.

         <title>Integrated Micro Space Electrostatic Field in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery: Scalable Electrospray Fabrication of Porous Crystalline Anode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospray has been applied for scalable fabrication (&gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous consumption of anions and direct contact between electrolyte and anode during the Zn&#8208;deposition process generate Zn&#8208;dendrites and side reactions that can aggravate the space&#8208;charge effect to hinder the practical implementation of zinc&#8208;metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, electrospray has been applied for the scalable fabrication (&gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection. The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (&#8776;72.8&#8197;mV) over 10&#8201;000 cycles at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to bare Zn and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition&#8208;kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.

         <title>Direct Monitoring of Li2S2 Evolution and Its Influence on the Reversible Capacities of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of operando spectral results reveal that Li2S2 undergoes chemical reactions accompanied by its electrochemical conversions during operation for the first time. The chemical reactions related to Li2S2 can increase polysulfide dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Instead of the commonly considered Li2S, Li2S2 is the solid &#8220;dead&#8221; sulfur species and restricts the actual sulfur utilization and reversible capacity.







Abstract
The polysulfide (PS) dissolution and low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li2S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) system. However, as the inevitable intermediate between PSs and Li2S, lithium disulfide (Li2S2) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, Li2S2 evolutions are monitored from the operando measurements on the pouch cell level. Results indicate that Li2S2 undergoes slow electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further PS dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity contribution. Compared with the fully oxidized Li2S, Li2S2 still residues at the end of the charging state. Therefore, instead of the considered Li2S and PSs, slow electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li2S2 are the determining factors in limiting the sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Disulfide&#8208;mediated Reversible Polymerization for Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid can catalyze the reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides, enabling a robust methodology that produces long poly(disulfide)s within a few minutes under open&#8208;air condition. High&#8208;yield chemical recycling from materials to monomers is achieved at gram scale, showing the capability of intrinsic dynamic polymers toward sustainable materials.







Abstract
Poly(1,2&#8208;dithiolane)s are a family of intrinsically recyclable polymers due to their dynamic covalent disulfide linkages. Despite the common use of thiolate&#8208;initiated anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) under basic condition, cationic ROP is still not exploited. Here we report that disulfide bond can act as a proton acceptor, being protonated by acids to form sulfonium cations, which can efficiently initiate the ROP of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes and result in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (over 1000&#8197;kDa) poly(disulfide)s. The reaction can be triggered by adding catalytic amounts of acids and non&#8208;coordinating anion salts, and completed in few minutes at room temperature. The acidic conditions allow the applicability for acidic monomers. Importantly, the reaction condition can be under open air without inert protection, enabling the nearly quantitative chemical recycling from bulk materials to original monomers.

         <title>A Switchable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Dye Based on Redox&#8208;Bistable Benzitetraazaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable, redox&#8208;switchable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins are reported. Whereas the 18&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic form does not show near&#8208;IR absorption, the antiaromatic 20&#960;&#8208;electron form unexpectedly shows intense near&#8208;IR absorption owing to an electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition resulting from symmetry&#8208;lowering of the porphyrin skeleton. The redox process is reversible and switching can be repeated multiple times.







Abstract
Activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench&#8208;stable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox&#8208;switchable NIR properties. X&#8208;Ray, NMR, and UV/Visible&#8208;NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 1 exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring&#8208;current, while 18&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 2 shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR&#8208;silent BzTAP 2 was readily converted to the NIR&#8208;active BzTAP 1 in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP 1 is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry&#8208;lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of 1 to be electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.

Whereas the 18&#960;-electron aromatic form does not show near-IR absorption, the antiaromatic 20&#960;-electron form unexpectedly shows intense near-IR absorption owing to an electric-dipole-allowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition resulting from symmetry-lowering of the porphyrin skeleton. The redox process is reversible and switching can be repeated multiple times.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activatable near-infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench-stable 18&#960;- and 20&#960;-electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox-switchable NIR properties. X-Ray, NMR, and UV/Visible-NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;-electron BzTAP &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring-current, while 18&#960;-electron BzTAP &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR-silent BzTAP &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was readily converted to the NIR-active BzTAP &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry-lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;-electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to be electric-dipole-allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The new hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster (DBA)4Cu4I4 enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a PLQY&gt;94.9&#8201;% by the coaction of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. Our investigation shows that this material has a great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications.







Abstract
The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodide clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure reorganization and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9&#8201;%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8211;300&#8197;K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of &#8776;5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.

         <title>Green&#8208;solvent Processable Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Star&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor structure with 3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile pyridine core has been developed as an efficient design strategy towards high performance green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The resulting BTP1 HTM processed by the green solvent 2&#8208;methylanisole, a kind of food additive, shows an impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% based on inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film&#8208;forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade&#8208;off, that is, constructing star&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A&#8208;D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1&#8208;2) can be processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34&#8201;% has been achieved for 2MA&#8208;processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green&#8208;solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D&#8208;A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.

         <title>Biomolecular Click Reactions Using a Minimal pH&#8208;Activated Catcher/Tag Pair for Producing Native&#8208;Sized Spider&#8208;Silk Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Catcher/Tag pair to be used for isopeptide&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated biological click reactions is reported. The newly designed pair, named SilkCatcher/Tag pair, shows activity both in vivo and in vitro and is pH&#8208;activated. Native&#8208;sized spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like protein in very high purity is produced by combining the SilkCatcher/Tag pair with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair.







Abstract
A type of protein/peptide pair known as Catcher/Tag pair spontaneously forms an intermolecular isopeptide bond which can be applied for biomolecular click reactions. Covalent protein conjugation using Catcher/Tag pairs has turned out to be a valuable tool in biotechnology and biomedicines, but it is essential to increase the current toolbox of orthogonal Catcher/Tag pairs to expand the range of applications further, for example, for controlled multiple&#8208;fragment ligation. We report here the engineering of novel Catcher/Tag pairs for protein ligation, aided by a crystal structure of a minimal CnaB domain from Lactobacillus plantarum. We show that a newly engineered pair, called SilkCatcher/Tag enables efficient pH&#8208;inducible protein ligation in addition to being compatible with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the SilkCatcher/Tag pair in the production of native&#8208;sized highly repetitive spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like proteins with &gt;90&#8201;% purity, which is not possible by traditional recombinant production methods.

         <title>Stepwise Engineering the Pore Aperture of a Cage&#8208;like MOF for the Efficient Separation of Isomeric C4 Paraffins under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake are achieved when methyl groups are installed on the pore window of a cage&#8208;like MOF. The hydrophobic microenvironment created by methyl groups eliminates the adverse effects of water vapor on the stability of MOF and n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.







Abstract
The separation of isomeric C4 paraffins is an important task in the petrochemical industry, while current adsorbents undergo a trade&#8208;off relationship between selectivity and adsorption capacity. In this work, the pore aperture of a cage&#8208;like Zn&#8208;bzc (bzc=pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) is tuned by the stepwise installation methyl groups on its narrow aperture to achieve both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake. Notably, the resulting Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 (bzc&#8208;2CH3=3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) can sensitively capture n&#8208;C4H10 and exclude iso&#8208;C4H10, affording molecular&#8208;sieving for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity (54.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1). Breakthrough tests prove n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 can be efficiently separated and high&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (99.99&#8201;%) can be collected. Importantly, the hydrophobic microenvironment created by the introduced methyl groups greatly improves the stability of Zn&#8208;bzc and significantly eliminates the negative effect of water vapor on gas separation under humid conditions, indicating Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 is a new benchmark adsorbent for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.

Notably, the resulting Zn-bzc-2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (bzc-2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=3,5-dimethylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid) can sensitively capture n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and exclude iso-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, affording molecular-sieving for n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/iso-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; separation and high n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity (54.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Breakthrough tests prove n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/iso-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently separated and high-purity iso-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (99.99&#8201;%) can be collected. Importantly, the hydrophobic microenvironment created by the introduced methyl groups greatly improves the stability of Zn-bzc and significantly eliminates the negative effect of water vapor on gas separation under humid conditions, indicating Zn-bzc-2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a new benchmark adsorbent for n-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;/iso-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 11/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to prepare hydrogels relies on consumption of a chemical fuel to transiently drive network crosslinking by host&#8211;guest motifs, thereby prompting hydrogelation. The temporary nature of this fuel&#8208;directed change in the interacting molecules causes the gels that are formed from this fuel to have a limited lifetime, autonomously converting back to their original pre&#8208;gel state over time without additional user input. Details of the study are reported by Matthew&#8197;J. Webber et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202216537).

         <dc:description>
Alternations of crystalline and amorphous states largely influence the solid&#8208;state properties of molecular materials. In their Research Article (e202217054), Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers show that the transformation between two states of an anthracene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic complex can tune the photosalient effect, mechanical luminescence, and photochromism behavior. The effect was assigned to competitive chemical routes between a photocycloaddition reaction in the crystalline state and photogenerated radicals in the amorphous state.

         <title>Stereochemical Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitingly, a recent report from the Wendlandt group solved the epimerization of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers, providing a rapid approach to convert more readily available stereoisomers into stereoisomers that were previously challenging to access (see scheme; HAA=hydrogen atom abstraction; HAD=hydrogen atom donation).







Abstract
Stereochemical editing has recently risen to prominence, allowing the direct editing of organic molecules with stereocenter(s) to adjust their relative stereochemistry at a late&#8208;stage. Several seminal light&#8208;driven stereochemical editing reactions such as deracemization and epimerization have been successively developed. Recently, Wendlandt and co&#8208;workers reported a versatile photochemical epimerization of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers to rapidly prepare the stereoisomers that were previously challenging to access.

         <title>Biotechnological Frontiers of DNA Nanomaterials Continue to Expand: Bacterial Infection using Virus&#8208;Inspired Capsids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of virus&#8208;inspired DNA&#8208;origami particles loaded with natural bacteriophage genomic cargo, scientists measured a retained functional infection in non&#8208;competent bacterial cells. Critical parameters for infectivity include structural rigidity and complete yet dynamic loading of the cargo through multivalent optimization of anchors.







Abstract
The elegant geometry of viruses has inspired bio&#8208;engineers to synthetically explore the self&#8208;assembly of polyhedral capsids employed to protect new cargo or change an enzymatic microenvironment. Recently, Yang and co&#8208;workers used DNA nanotechnology to revisit the icosahedral capsid structure of the phiX174 bacteriophage and reloaded the original viral genome as cargo into their fully synthetic architecture. Surprisingly, when using a favorable combination of structural rigidity and dynamic multivalent cargo entrapment, the synthetic particles were able to infect non&#8208;competent bacterial cells and produce the original phiX174 bacteriophage. This work presents an exciting new direction of DNA nanotech for bio&#8208;engineering applications which involve bacterial interactions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stability Challenges and Opportunities in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale application of polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is suffering from long&#8208;term stability challenges in anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This review provides a thorough discussion of degradation mechanisms, catalyst design principles and future research opportunities to serve as a cornerstone for overcoming the dilemma in acidic OER stability and achieving the industrialization of water electrolysis.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has been regarded as a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability impose a grand challenge in its large&#8208;scale industrialization. In this review, critical factors that may lead to catalyst's instability in couple with potential solutions are comprehensively discussed, including mechanical peeling, substrate corrosion, active&#8208;site over&#8208;oxidation/dissolution, reconstruction, oxide crystal structure collapse through the lattice oxygen&#8208;participated reaction pathway, etc. Last but not least, personal prospects are provided in terms of rigorous stability evaluation criteria, in situ/operando characterizations, economic feasibility and practical electrolyzer consideration, highlighting the ternary relationship of structure evolution, industrial&#8208;relevant activity and stability to serve as a roadmap towards the ultimate application of PEMWE.

         <title>Metalloallostery and Transition Metal Signaling: Bioinorganic Copper Chemistry Beyond Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloallostery, where metals regulate protein function through binding to a remote allosteric exosite rather than an active site, expands the roles of metals in biological chemistry. Using copper as a canonical example, we summarize advances in the field through imaging tools for labile metal pools, positive and negative allosteric transition metal signaling, and copper&#8208;dependent regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.







Abstract
Transition metal chemistry is essential to life, where metal binding to DNA, RNA, and proteins underpins all facets of the central dogma of biology. In this context, metals in proteins are typically studied as static active site cofactors. However, the emergence of transition metal signaling, where mobile metal pools can transiently bind to biological targets beyond active sites, is expanding this conventional view of bioinorganic chemistry. This Minireview focuses on the concept of metalloallostery, using copper as a canonical example of how metals can regulate protein function by binding to remote allosteric sites (e.g., exosites). We summarize advances in and prospects for the field, including imaging dynamic transition metal signaling pools, allosteric inhibition or activation of protein targets by metal binding, and metal&#8208;dependent signaling pathways that underlie nutrient vulnerabilities in diseases spanning obesity, fatty liver disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration.

         <title>Precise Assembly of Polyoxometalates at Single&#8208;cluster Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on the precise synthesis of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined structures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies, cluster&#8208;nuclei co&#8208;assemblies, POM&#8208;POSS co&#8208;cluster assemblies and POM&#8208;polymer co&#8208;assemblies. In particular, POM based sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties due to the multiscale assembly and topological interactions between nanowires.







Abstract
Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with atomic precision structures are promising candidates construct functional nanomaterials via self&#8208;assembly. Non&#8208;covalent interactions at molecular levels can govern the self&#8208;assembly of POM clusters, for which the precise control of POM&#8208;based assemblies can be realized at single&#8208;cluster levels. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the synthesis and properties of POM&#8208;based nanostructures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies and co&#8208;assemblies of POM clusters and other subnanometer building blocks. Several synthetic strategies have been developed for rational control of POM&#8208;based assemblies in terms of morphologies, compositions and properties. 1D subnanometer POM assemblies demonstrate remarkable enhanced mechanical properties due to the topological interactions between nanowires and surroundings. The in&#8208;depth understanding of POM&#8208;based assemblies may help in the design of functional nanomaterials in fundamental perspectives and applications.

         <title>Porous Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced porous materials (APMs) including MOFs, COFs, and POPs, have seen tremendous development as effective adsorbents for the segregation of components of interest. In this Review, recent advancements of APMs applied for water purification are overviewed systematically according to the type of water contaminant.







Abstract
Water pollution is a growing threat to humanity due to the pervasiveness of contaminants in water bodies. Significant efforts have been made to separate these hazardous components to purify polluted water through various methods. However, conventional remediation methods suffer from limitations such as low uptake capacity or selectivity, and current water quality standards cannot be met. Recently, advanced porous materials (APMs) have shown promise in improved segregation of contaminants compared to traditional porous materials in uptake capacity and selectivity. These materials feature merits of high surface area and versatile functionality, rendering them ideal platforms for the design of novel adsorbents. This Review summarizes the development and employment of APMs in a variety of water treatments accompanied by assessments of task&#8208;specific adsorption performance. Finally, we discuss our perspectives on future opportunities for APMs in water purification.

         <title>Enhanced Energy Transfer in A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes excited&#8208;state nickel&#8208;catalyzed borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions in a covalent organic framework (COF). Rapid energy transfer in the sp2&#8208;carbon conjugated COF facilitates the generation of aryl radicals from nickel&#8208;aryl complexes, leading to two orders of magnitude higher catalytic efficiency than the homogeneous counterpart in aryl borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received broad interest owing to their permanent porosity, high stability, and tunable functionalities. COFs with long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;conjugation and photosensitizing building blocks have been explored for sustainable photocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of COF&#8208;based energy transfer Ni catalysis. A pyrene&#8208;based COF with sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugation was synthesized and used to coordinate NiII centers through bipyridine moieties. Under light irradiation, enhanced energy transfer in the COF facilitated the excitation of Ni centers to catalyze borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions of aryl halides. The COF showed two orders of magnitude higher efficiency in these reactions than its homogeneous control and could be recovered and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Stress&#8208;Induced Inversion of Linear Dichroism by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Rotation in a Superelastic Organic Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine molecule in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular trimer can be rotated 90&#176; around the hydrogen bonds, leading to a single&#8208;crystal superelastic deformation associated with a reversible inversion of linear dichroism spectra.







Abstract
The molecular crystals that manifest unusual mechanical properties have attracted growing attention. Herein, we prepared an organic single crystal that shows bidirectional superelastic transformation in response to shear stress. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions revealed this crystal&#8208;twinning related shape change is owed to a stress&#8208;controlled 90&#176; rotation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine around the hydrogen bonds of a chiral organic trimer. As a consequence of the 90&#176; shift in the aromatic plane, an interconversion of crystallographic a&#8208;, b&#8208;axes (a&#8594;b&#8242; and b&#8594;a&#8242;) was detected. The molecular rotations changed the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Therefore, a stress&#8208;induced inversion of linear dichroism spectra was demonstrated for the first time. This study reveals the superior mechanical flexibilities of single crystals can be realized by harnessing the molecular rotations and this superelastic crystal may find applications in optical switching and communications.

         <title>A New Bacterial Adenosine&#8208;Derived Nucleoside as an Example of RNA Modification Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem mass spectrometry combined with stable isotope labelling identified a new nucleoside species, namely 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenosine (ms2&#1013;A), in bacterial transfer RNA (tRNA). Its rare occurrence on tRNA, especially when involved in translation, and the structural as well as metabolic relation to the known tRNA modification 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A) argue for ms2&#1013;A to be an oxidatively damaged form of ms2i6A.







Abstract
The fields of RNA modification and RNA damage both exhibit a plethora of non&#8208;canonical nucleoside structures. While RNA modifications have evolved to improve RNA function, the term RNA damage implies detrimental effects. Based on stable isotope labelling and mass spectrometry, we report the identification and characterisation of 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenosine (ms2&#1013;A), which is related to 1,N6&#8208;ethenoadenine, a lesion resulting from exposure of nucleic acids to alkylating chemicals in vivo. In contrast, a sophisticated isoprene labelling scheme revealed that ms2&#1013;A biogenesis involves cleavage of a prenyl moiety in the known transfer RNA (tRNA) modification 2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (ms2i6A). The relative abundance of ms2&#1013;A in tRNAs from translating ribosomes suggests reduced function in comparison to its parent RNA modification, establishing the nature of the new structure in a newly perceived overlap of the two previously separate fields, namely an RNA modification damage.

         <title>Predicting Highly Enantioselective Catalysts Using Tunable Fragment Descriptors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and robust predictive models using flexible 2D fragment descriptors, particularly suited for asymmetric catalysis, are described. From training data with only moderate selectivities, highly enantioselective catalysts were predicted and validated, enabling a catalytic asymmetric construction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydropyrans.







Abstract
Catalyst optimization processes typically rely on inductive and qualitative assumptions of chemists based on screening data. While machine learning models using molecular properties or calculated 3D structures enable quantitative data evaluation, costly quantum chemical calculations are often required. In contrast, readily available binary fingerprint descriptors are time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient, but their predictive performance remains insufficient. Here, we describe a machine learning model based on fragment descriptors, which are fine&#8208;tuned for asymmetric catalysis and represent cyclic or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, enabling robust and efficient virtual screening. Using training data with only moderate selectivities, we designed theoretically and validated experimentally new catalysts showing higher selectivities in a challenging asymmetric tetrahydropyran synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Enals with Carboxylic Acids Using an Iodine(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent was developed to enable enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids, affording &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters in good yields with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step involves the formation of an enol iodine(III) intermediate, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic.







Abstract
The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids was developed via the umpolung of an NHC&#8208;bound enolate with an iodine(III) reagent. The corresponding &#945;&#8208;acyloxyl&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters were afforded in good yields, with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The key step of the reaction involves the formation of enol iodine(III) intermediate from the enolate with iodosobenzene, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of the enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic, and thus facilitates the subsequent addition of carboxylate.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework for Water Harvesting with Fast Kinetics and Low Regeneration Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional water adsorption/desorption dynamic properties and low regeneration temperature were achieved by 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 1D open channels and alternatively arranged hydrophilic/hydrophobic segments. It is promising for improving cycle efficiency and lowering the energy consumption in the atmospheric water harvesting processes.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting represents a promising technique to address water stress. Advanced adsorbents have been rationally designed to achieve high water uptake, yet their water sorption kinetics and regeneration temperature greatly limit water production efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring hydrophobic skeleton, proper hydrophilic site density, and 1D open channels significantly lowered the water diffusion and desorption energy barrier. DHTA&#8208;Pa COF showed a high water uptake of 0.48&#8197;g/g at 30&#8201;% R.H. with a remarkable adsorption rate of 0.72&#8197;L/Kg/h (298&#8197;K) and a desorption rate of 2.58&#8197;L/Kg/h (333&#8197;K). Moreover, more than 90&#8201;% adsorbed water could be released within 20&#8197;min at 313&#8197;K. This kinetic performance surpassed the reported porous materials and boosted the efficiency for multiple water extraction cycles. It may shed light on the material design strategy to achieve high daily water production with low&#8208;energy input.

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 11, March 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar phosphorus chalcogenide cages (&#946;&#8208;P4S3, &#946;&#8208;P4S4, &#946;&#8208;P4Se3, &#946;&#8208;P4Se4) with strong hyperpolarizabilities as functional molecules are introduced into inorganic adducts, resulting in four high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical materials. Among them, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 exhibits the largest second harmonic generation response (3.5&#215;AGS @ 2&#8197;&#956;m) in inorganic adducts.







Abstract
Inorganic adducts are an emerging class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05&#8197;&#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO&#8208;active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Discovering the Intrinsic Causes of Dendrite Formation in Zinc Metal Anodes: Lattice Defects and Residual Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual stress and lattice defects in commercial zinc anode have been confirmed to be essential factors to the dendrite formation during zinc deposition by experiments and theoretical calculations, as they induced heterogeneous deposition on the zinc surface and limited the epitaxial growth of zinc.







Abstract
Developing a highly stable and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode is essential to the commercial application of zinc metal batteries. However, the understanding of zinc dendrites formation mechanism is still insufficient. Herein, for the first time, we discover that the interfacial heterogeneous deposition induced by lattice defects and epitaxial growth limited by residual stress are intrinsic and critical causes for zinc dendrite formation. Therefore, an annealing reconstruction strategy was proposed to eliminate lattice defects and stresses in zinc crystals, which achieve dense epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc anode. The as&#8208;prepared annealed zinc anodes exhibit dendrite&#8208;free morphology and enhanced electrochemical cycling stability. This work first proves that lattice defects and residual stresses are also very important factors for epitaxial electrodeposition of zinc in addition to crystal orientation, which can provide a new mechanism for future researches on zinc anode modification.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Cascades Combining Biocatalysis and Transition Metal Catalysis for Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging metal and enzyme catalysis provides multiple solutions for the synthesis of optically active molecules. To achieve this aim, both catalyst types need to work under similar reaction conditions avoiding mutual inactivation. Herein, successful one&#8208;pot sequential and concurrent cascades are described for the design of high&#8208;yielding transformations with excellent levels of (stereo)selectivity.







Abstract
The combination of catalytic methods provides multiple advantages in organic synthesis, allowing access to diverse organic molecules in a straightforward manner. Merging metal and enzyme catalysis is currently receiving great attention due to the possibility to assemble metal catalysis in C&#8722;C coupling, olefin metathesis, hydration and other reactions with the exquisite stereospecificity displayed by enzymes. Thus, this minireview is organized based on the action of the metal species (Pd, Ru, Au, Ir, Fe&#8230;) in combination with different enzymes. Special attention will be paid to the design of sequential processes and concurrent cascades, presenting solutions such as the use of surfactants or compartmentalization strategies for those cases where incompatibilities could hamper the overall process.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides under mild conditions is reported. The enantioselective alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides provided P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
A general and mild nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides has been developed. The asymmetric alkenylation/arylation of racemic secondary phosphine oxides with alkenyl/aryl bromides generated P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine oxides with high yields and enantioselectivities. Various functional groups were tolerated, and the applications of this method were demonstrated through late&#8208;stage functionalization and product transformations.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Iron(II)&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase for Site&#8208;Selective Azidation of Unactivated Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds
</title>

         <dc:description>
Directed evolution is used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that catalyze site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. This result provides a promising starting point for evolving additional variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.







Abstract
FeII&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases and oxygenases can catalyze site&#8208;selective functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via a variety of C&#8722;X bond forming reactions, but achieving high chemoselectivity for functionalization using non&#8208;native functional groups remains rare. The current study shows that directed evolution can be used to engineer variants of the dioxygenase SadX that address this challenge. Site&#8208;selective azidation of succinylated amino acids and a succinylated amine was achieved as a result of mutations throughout the SadX structure. The installed azide group was reduced to a primary amine, and the succinyl group required for azidation was enzymatically cleaved to provide the corresponding amine. These results provide a promising starting point for evolving additional SadX variants with activity on structurally distinct substrates and for enabling enzymatic C&#8722;H functionalization with other non&#8208;native functional groups.

         <title>Correlative Cellular Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Amperometry Show Dose Dependent Changes in Lipid Composition and Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel analytical tools single cell amperometry (SCA), intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC), and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging were combined to provide a link between the complex etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and lipidomic information.







Abstract
Aberrant functioning of the proteasome has been associated with crucial pathologic conditions including neurodegeneration. Yet, the complex underlying causes at the cellular level remain unclear and there are conflicting reports of neuroprotective to neurodegenerative effects of proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin that are utilised as models for neurodegenerative diseases. The conflicting results may be associated with different dose regimes of lactacystin and hence we have performed a dose dependent study of the effects of lactacystin to identify concurrent changes in the cell membrane lipid profile and the dynamics of exocytosis using a combination of surface sensitive mass spectrometry and single cell amperometry. Significant changes of negatively charged lipids were associated with different lactacystin doses that showed a weak correlation with exocytosis while changes in PE and PE&#8722;O lipids showed dose dependent changes correlated with initial pore formation and total release of vesicle content respectively.

         <title>Annealing in Argon Universally Upgrades the Na&#8208;Storage Performance of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes by Creating Bulk Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach of annealing in argon atmosphere rather than conventional air is for the first time, demonstrated to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance (including specific capacity, operating voltage, and cycling durability) of Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes by creating bulk oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are extremely promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high capacities and cost effectiveness, while the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion and low operating potential of Mn redox largely hinder their practical applications. Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3d&#8208;orbital energy level, and formation of the new&#8208;concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2&#8208;Na0.75Mg0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode increases by &#8776;50&#8201;% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J&#8211;T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability. This exciting finding opens a new avenue towards high&#8208;performance Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Chiral Calix[3]pyrrole Derivatives: Synthesis, Racemization Kinetics, and Ring Expansion to Calix[9]&#8208; and Calix[12]pyrrole Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral calix[3]pyrrole derivative was synthesized from a polyketone precursor. Although the macrocycle racemizes through ring inversion at room temperature, N&#8208;methylation effectively suppressed the racemization, allowing chiral resolution of the enantiomers. Ring expansion reaction allowed access to calix[9]&#8208; and calix[12]pyrrole&#8208;type macrocycles, the largest of which was characterized by an X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Chiral pyrrolic macrocycles continue to attract interest. However, their molecular design remains challenging. Here, we report a calixpyrrole&#8208;based chiral macrocyclic system, calix[1]furan[1]pyrrole[1]thiophene (1), synthesized from an oligoketone. Macrocycle 1 adopts a partial cone conformation in the solid state, and undergoes racemization via ring inversion. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that inversion of the thiophene is the rate determining step. Pyrrole N&#8208;methylation suppressed racemization and permitted chiral resolution. Enantioselective N&#8208;methylation also occurred in the presence of a chiral ammonium salt, although the stereoselectivity is modest. A unique feature of 1 is that it acts as a useful synthetic precursor to yield several calix[n]furan[n]pyrrole[n]thiophene products (n=2&#8211;4), including a calix[12]pyrrole analogue that to our knowledge constitutes the largest calix[n]pyrrole&#8208;like species to be structurally characterized.

         <title>A Hydrolyzable Supra&#8208;amphiphile as a Marangoni Self&#8208;Propulsion Fuel for Efficient Macroscopic Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible Schiff base has been used as the basis for a fuel for continuous Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion. Excessive interfacial aggregation of the amphiphilic molecules is avoided by timely hydrolyzation to surface&#8208;inactive species, which prolongs the motion lifetime by over 10&#8197;times. The fuel can efficiently propel &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components for the energy&#8208;dissipative self&#8208;assembly of precisely aligned structures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components is important for achieving all&#8208;scale ordering with requirements of extra energy for motion and interaction of components. Marangoni flows caused by surfactants on water provide appropriate energy but have limited lifetimes because of the inevitable interfacial aggregation and difficult decomposition of aggregated covalent surfactants that inactivate Marangoni effects. Here we have synthesized a supra&#8208;amphiphile Marangoni &#8220;fuel&#8221;&#8212;sodium&#8208;4&#8208;(benzylideneamino) benzenesulfonate (SBBS)&#8212;that can be hydrolyzed in a timely manner to a species without surface activity to extend the motion time by 10&#8208;fold. The motion was optimized at pH=2 by a fine equilibrium between the releasing and removal of interfacial SBBS, leading to the self&#8208;assembly of millimeter&#8208;scaled ordered dimers. The underlying mechanism was interpreted by motion analyses and simulation. This strategy provides an active solution to self&#8208;assembly at the &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm scale, as well as interactive ideas between miniaturized chemical robots.

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;driven Nanoparticle Crystalsomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystallization of an end&#8208;functionalized polymer and nanoparticles (NPs) leads to the formation of hollow spherical assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization, the translational symmetry is broken in NPCs. This strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translation symmetry.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) assembly has been extensively studied, and a library of NP superstructures has been synthesized. These intricate structures show unique collective optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this work, we report a bottom&#8208;up approach for fabricating spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies that mimic colloidosomes. Co&#8208;crystallization of lipoic acid&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and AuNPs in solution via a self&#8208;seeding method led to the formation of hollow spherical NP assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the spherical shape, the translational symmetry of PEO crystals is broken in NPCs, which can be attributed to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization. This was confirmed by tuning the NPC morphology via varying the self&#8208;seeding temperature, crystallization temperature, and PEO molecular weight. We envisage that this strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translational symmetry.
