         <title>Pre&#8208;Activation as a Route for Tuning the Kinetics of Mechanochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of mechanochemical reactions can be markedly altered through the selective pre&#8208;activation of starting reagents, as revealed through reaction monitoring using time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and ab initio density functional theory simulation.








Abstract
Learning to control reaction kinetics is essential for translating any chemical technology into real&#8208;world application. Based on time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we demonstrate the opportunity to tune mechanochemical reaction rates through the pre&#8208;activation of the starting reagents. For three model co&#8208;crystal systems, the pre&#8208;activation of the most stable reagent yields up to a ca 10&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate, whilst negligible kinetic enhancement is seen when the less stable reagent is pre&#8208;activated. Moreover, we demonstrate how the polymorphic outcome of mechano&#8208;co&#8208;crystallization is also sensitive to pre&#8208;activation of the starting material. Our results suggest that reproducibility of mechanochemical processes requires detailed understanding over the origin and history of reagent powders, whilst providing a new conceptual framework to design and control mechanochemical reactions.

         <title>Revolutionizing Quinoidal Optoelectronics Through Heterojunction Engineering for Tri&#8208;Modal Reconfigurability Wide&#8208;Spectral Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type&#8208;II heterojunction phototransistor is developed by integrating an n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. This design exploits complementary absorption and efficient intermolecular charge transfer, enabling wide&#8208;spectral detection (300&#8211;1200&#160;nm) with a low detection threshold (3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2) and fast response (20&#160;ms). The tri&#8208;modal reconfigurability and gate&#8208;tunable photoconductivity support high&#8208;contrast imaging and secure optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Quinoidal&#8208;conjugated materials are notable for their ultra&#8208;low LUMO levels (&lt;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV) and exceptional wide&#8208;spectral absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region, attributed to their narrow optical bandgaps. However, their inferior charge transport properties hinder the simultaneous optimization of light absorption and carrier mobility, thereby limiting performance in detection sensitivity and response speed across the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR range. To address this challenge, we developed a novel heterojunction architecture phototransistor combining a new n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule (Q4T) with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor (C10&#8208;DNTT). Leveraging the complementary absorption of heterogeneous semiconductors and efficient intermolecular charge transfer in type&#8208;II heterojunctions, the phototransistor enables wide&#8208;spectral detection from 300 to 1200&#160;nm. It demonstrates tri&#8208;modal operational reconfigurability, offering versatile photoresponse characteristics. Remarkably, the device exhibits a low detection threshold of 3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2, underscoring its high sensitivity. Additionally, the optimized heterostructure ensures a fast response time of 20&#160;ms, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications. The integration of spectrally resolved positive/negative photoconductivity with gate&#8208;tunable operation modes enables high&#8208;contrast image sensing and secure information encryption/decryption. This heterojunction strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of quinoidal semiconductors and establishes a versatile platform for all&#8208;organic bidirectional optoelectronic systems, offering promising prospects for intelligent spectral sensing technologies.

         <title>Supramolecular Carbohydrate Assemblies with Tunable Glycan Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials with a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrates on their surfaces, serving as biological cues.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of molecular building blocks into ordered supramolecular structures enables the creation of nanomaterials that can display ligands on their surfaces with molecular precision. However, many of these supramolecular scaffolds face challenges in incorporating bulky or hydrophilic ligands, such as carbohydrates. This issue often requires the co&#8208;assembly of ligand&#8208;containing blocks with non&#8208;functionalized ones, diluting ligand presentation and compromising their precise spatial arrangement. Herein, we present carbohydrate oligomers that assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials featuring a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrate ligands on their surfaces. This modular system accommodates a variety of carbohydrate ligands while maintaining consistent bulk material properties. Using this approach, we have engineered a series of supramolecular hydrogels, whose nanostructure displays specific carbohydrate residues with high density that act as biological cues to influence the morphology of Candida albicans.

         <title>Ionizable Nano&#8208;PROTAC Overcomes Endosomal Entrapment for Enhanced LRG1 Degradation and Tumor Suppression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionizable nano&#8208;PROTACs i16&#8208;ELNC incorporate pH&#8208;responsive tertiary amines that boost cellular uptake and facilitate proton&#8208;sponge&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, enabling efficient cytosolic delivery for LRG1 degradation. This approach overcomes endosomal entrapment, resulting in significant tumor regression with minimal systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Nanoscale proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) have emerged as a promising modality that circumvents conventional linker optimization using multivalent engineering. However, their therapeutic potential remains severely limited by inefficient cytosolic delivery caused by endosomal entrapment. To address this challenge, we integrated a tertiary&#8208;amine motif into amphiphilic conjugates, which co&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208;PROTACs (designed as i16&#8208;ETNC) optimized for protein degradation. Mechanistically, i16&#8208;ETNC exploits a synergistic dual mechanism in which the ionizable tertiary amine cooperates with a C16 hydrophobic tail to enhance cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape via proton sponge effects, enabling efficient delivery to the cytosol. This design achieves potent degradation of the oncogenic target leucine&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) in 4T1 murine breast tumors. Systematic evaluation shows that i16&#8208;ETNC effectively induces LRG1 degradation, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition, strong apoptosis induction, and notable tumor regression, all without detectable systemic toxicity. Overall, this study presents a broadly applicable strategy to address endosomal entrapment in targeted protein degradation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of nano&#8208;PROTACs.

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis Driving Auto&#8208;Catalytic Process Toward Oxidant&#8208;Free Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry for Water Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
A Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) featuring adjacent Fe and Co atoms each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate enables synergistic electron extraction from pollutants, facilitating rapid pollutant degradation through an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway.








Abstract
Driving oxidant&#8208;free catalysis toward green and efficient Fenton&#8208;like chemistry for water purification has been developed as a research hotspots of priority concern. In this study, a Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) was synthesized with adjacent Fe and Co atoms coordinating with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate, and applied in an oxidant&#8208;free system for pollutant degradation via an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway. Results showed dissolved oxygen (DO) was not the primary electron acceptor. In contrast, pollutants were adsorbed on electron&#8208;deficient sites, with electrons transferred to electron&#8208;rich dual Fe/Co sites via the carbon network, evidenced by a 0.6 oxidation state decrease and reduced open circuit potential. Intermediate analysis also confirmed the degradation process beyond adsorption process. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Fe doping not only introduced the additional active sites but also modulated the electronic structure of Co, making it more favorable for accepting the electrons from pollutants. This synergistic interaction facilitated effective contaminant degradation within the oxidant&#8208;free system. Furthermore, lifecycle analysis showed better environmental performance than conventional oxidant&#8208;added systems. This study provides new insights into the oxidant&#8208;free Fenton&#8208;like chemistry and advances the low&#8208;energy and low&#8208;chemical consumption water treatment technologies.

In this study, a Fe/Co dual single-atom catalyst (FeCo-DSAC) was synthesized with adjacent Fe and Co atoms coordinating with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate, and applied in an oxidant-free system for pollutant degradation via an auto-catalytic pathway. Results showed dissolved oxygen (DO) was not the primary electron acceptor. In contrast, pollutants were adsorbed on electron-deficient sites, with electrons transferred to electron-rich dual Fe/Co sites via the carbon network, evidenced by a 0.6 oxidation state decrease and reduced open circuit potential. Intermediate analysis also confirmed the degradation process beyond adsorption process. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Fe doping not only introduced the additional active sites but also modulated the electronic structure of Co, making it more favorable for accepting the electrons from pollutants. This synergistic interaction facilitated effective contaminant degradation within the oxidant-free system. Furthermore, lifecycle analysis showed better environmental performance than conventional oxidant-added systems. This study provides new insights into the oxidant-free Fenton-like chemistry and advances the low-energy and low-chemical consumption water treatment technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Enabled Double Borylation Strategy for &#960;&#8208;Extended MR&#8208;TADF Emitters: From Synthetic Challenge to Benchmark OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a concise and versatile synthetic strategy for multiple resonance (MR) emitters. In this approach, chlorine atoms play a &#8220;dual role&#8221;: they not only direct regioselective one&#8208;shot double borylation but also serve as reactive handles for derivatization, enabling facile tuning of physical properties. As a representative example, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved ideal deep&#8208;green emission with record&#8208;high efficiencies at high luminance levels.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials are promising emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. However, realizing pure&#8208;green, narrowband emission with simultaneously high efficiency and stability remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for display applications. In this study, we report a concise one&#8208;shot double borylation strategy uniquely enabled by chlorine substituents acting as both directing and functional groups. This dual role not only ensures regioselective synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) framework&#8212;previously considered synthetically inaccessible&#8212;but also provides versatile handles for late&#8208;stage diversification. The resulting key intermediate, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cl, was obtained in 48% yield and readily converted into a series of structurally diverse MR&#8208;TADF emitters through single&#8208;step derivatizations. These emitters exhibited narrowband emissions from deep green to yellow&#8208;green (FWHM 27&#8211;34&#160;nm) with tunable photophysical properties. Notably, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence devices based on W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.1%. More importantly, the device maintained record&#8208;high efficiencies of 34.3% and 29.5% at luminance levels of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best efficiency&#8211;brightness trade&#8208;off among reported green sensitized OLEDs. This work not only overcomes synthetic bottlenecks in accessing &#960;&#8208;extended MR&#8208;TADF frameworks but also establishes a versatile platform for color&#8208;tunable, high&#8208;performance OLEDs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chlorine&#8208;Terminated MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction with TiCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium tetrachloride is demonstrated as a new gas&#8208;phase etchant to fabricate several different chlorine&#8208;terminated&#160;MXenes from their parent MAX phases in a completely dry process. The MXene structures are analyzed, and the experimental results are corroborated by computational analysis. Ti3C2Cl2 MXene is then delaminated using Li intercalant in organic solvents and subjected to further characterization. 








Abstract
Despite rapid research progress in the field of MXenes over the past decade, this new family of nanomaterials still faces challenges in terms of scalable manufacturing and control over surface chemistry, which determines many of their physicochemical properties. This work demonstrates titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a new type of gas&#8208;phase etchant for the dry selective extraction of the A&#8208;element (Al) from MAX phases, providing MXenes with uniform chlorine surface terminations. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive washing, which is required in the cases of wet&#8208;chemical and molten salt etching. Computational data suggest that TiCl4 reacts with the MAX phases directly to extract AlCl3 rather than forming any intermediate phases. One of the resulting MXenes, Ti3C2Cl2, was then delaminated into few&#8208;layer flakes by intercalating lithium ions from an organic solvent. Some of the hydrophobic delaminated flakes were discovered to roll into a tubular shape, forming 1&#8208;dimensional nanoscrolls. Our dry etching process provides opportunities for the scalable synthesis of halogen&#8208;terminated Ti&#8208; and Nb&#8208;based MXenes with two to four M&#8208;element layers and controlled surface chemistry.

         <title>From CO2 to C1 Liquid Fuels: Molecular Electrochemical Production of Formic Acid and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable transformation of CO2 into formic acid and methanol is key to circular carbon economies and sustainable energy. These liquid C1 products are high in energy density, easy to store, and serve as hydrogen carriers and feedstocks. Electrochemical CO2 reduction provides a promising route for carbon recycling and renewable energy integration. This minireview highlights recent advances in electrocatalysts design, mechanistic insights, and emerging strategies for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 fuel conversion.








Abstract
Transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) as C1 liquid fuels is central to advancing circular carbon economies and sustainable energy applications. Both CH3OH and HCOOH possess high energy density and are easily storable and transportable. Beyond their widespread use as solvents and C1 feedstock chemicals, CH3OH can be applied in fuel cells or serve as a hydrogen precursor, making it valuable for transportation and grid&#8208;level energy storage. HCOOH similarly functions as a safe hydrogen carrier and as a fuel in formic acid fuel cells. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) to these C1 products represents a pivotal step in closing the anthropogenic carbon loop, enabling sustainable energy storage. Recent years have brought notable advances in catalyst development, mechanistic understanding, and system optimization. Although metal&#8208;free catalysts and conductive polymers have advanced at a fast pace, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing systems remain the most effective, offering superior activity, selectivity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Particularly promising are dual&#8208;function systems that integrate CO2 capture/absorption with electroreduction, offering a promising route toward the direct valorization of industrial CO2 emissions. This minireview critically evaluates recent advances in molecular and polymer&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems, design strategies, and emerging directions for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 liquid fuel conversion technologies.

         <title>Ring Strain&#8208;Promoted Activation of Pyridines by a Saturated BSi2 Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly strained boratadisilirane with the elusive anionic BSi2 ring motif. Cleavage of the Si&#9472;Si bond during reactions with pyridine derivatives activates them in three different ways: 1) for pyridine itself selective ortho&#8208;CH activation and concomitant hydrogen transfer to a second pyridine molecule occurs, 2) with dimethylaminopyridine, unprecedented C&#9472;C bond formation happens between the two DMAP equivalents, and 3) in pentafluoropyridine the para&#8208;CF bond is activated under formation of regioisomers.








Abstract
Ring strain is a well&#8208;established strategy to increase reactivity. Employing an elusive saturated BSi2 ring motif, we here exploit the size mismatch between boron and silicon to this end. The reaction of disilenide Tip2Si = SiTipLi with BH3&#183;SMe2 selectively affords the lithium salt of anionic boratadisilirane c&#8208;SiTip2SiHTipBH2&#8722; (Tip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), which according to DFT calculations on the parent system BSi2H6&#8722; is much more strained than isoelectronic analogues such as cyclopropane (C3H6), boratirane (BC2H6&#8722;), and cyclotrisilane (Si3H6). Indeed, it spontaneously and selectively activates a range of pyridine derivatives: pyridine itself undergoes ortho&#8208;CH activation under dearomatization of a second equivalent; 2 equivalents of para&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) are C&#9472;C&#8208;coupled in ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;position; and pentafluoropyridine (PFP) is CF&#8208;activated in para&#8208;position.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local electric fields guide protons toward the heme through two distinct electrostatic funnels at the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges in heme peroxidases. Water&#8208;mediated pathways enable proton exchange with key residues such as Arg38 and His42. These findings reveal that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple, well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery, conserved across heme peroxidase enzymes.

         <title>Confining Reaction Intermediates in Oxide&#8208;Derived Hollow Cu&#8211;Zn Bimetallic Catalyst Facilitates Selective Formation of C2+ Alcohols from Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement strategy has been shown to enhance the C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalyst. The hollow catalyst confines the reaction intermediate by slowing down their outflow and hence enhances the retention time of the intermediates. This leads to an increased surface coverage of CO that favors the C&#9472;C coupling that enhances the C2+ product formation. 








Abstract
Copper has long been the only element known to produce multicarbon (C2+) products from CO2 through electrochemical pathways. However, its low kinetic barrier favors ethylene formation over C2&#8314; alcohols at the selectivity&#8208;determining step (SDS). Alloying Cu with secondary metals has been explored to shift selectivity toward alcohols, but these approaches often suffer from poor activity and selectivity. In this work, we probe the role of confinement of reaction intermediates in favoring C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in oxide&#8208;derived hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalysts. From finite element method (FEM) simulation, it was observed that hollow catalyst increases the retention time of the reaction intermediates that favor the C&#9472;C coupling. Confinement gives rise to a two&#8208;fold increment in the overall C2+ product. We observed that the hollow Cu&#8211;Zn catalyst gives a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 50.13% toward C2+ alcohol and an overall FE of 81% toward C2+ product at a very high current density of 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KHCO3. DFT calculation shows that Zn affects selectivity determining step (SDS) and favors the formation of alcohol over ethylene. Various in situ techniques, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, were used to understand the active phase of the catalyst and mechanism in detail.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of H&#8208;Phosphinamidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective (up to 99% ee) synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates via an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkynylation is reported. The resulting enantioenriched H&#8208;phosphinamidates are configurationally stable and ambiphilic, enabling diverse stereospecific P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S transformations, and establishing them as a general and versatile platform for P(V)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks. 








Abstract
Enantioenriched heteroatom&#8208;containing H&#8208;phosphoryl compounds unite a nucleophilic H&#8211;P(O) moiety with an electrophilic, substitutable heteroatom group, endowing them with inherent ambiphilicity and making them powerful platforms for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules&#8212;structures of growing significance in asymmetric synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Yet their enantioselective synthesis has remained a significant challenge. Here we report the first highly enantioselective synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates. These bifunctional, configurationally stable compounds enable stereospecific H&#8211;P(O) transformations to access diverse P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S linkages, while the amino group offers an orthogonal handle for secondary derivatization. These reactivity features establish H&#8208;phosphinamidates as a versatile and general platform for the modular synthesis of structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Engineering Anionic Aggregation in Dilute Electrolyte for High Performance Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a dilute (0.5 M) high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HE&#8208;THF) engineered with anionic aggregation for layered oxide cathodes. It enables the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich, dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) via anion&#8208;derived &#8220;clusters&#8221;. Successful application in a NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) cathode showcased enhanced cycling stability and broad temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered increasing attention due to their distinctive advantages. However, they still confront a series of technical challenges, particularly in cycle stability and energy density. Notably, layered oxide cathode materials experience irreversible structural changes during electrochemical processes, which significantly hinders SIBs from achieving their theoretical metrics. Here, we developed a dilute 0.5&#160;M high&#8208;entropy electrolyte. Remarkably, despite its low salt concentration, this electrolyte features an anion&#8208;rich solvation sheath and forms distinctive &#8220;clusters&#8221;, facilitating the creation of an inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This CEI layer effectively passivates the electrode and prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation. Importantly, the high&#8208;entropy dilute electrolyte enables the layered oxide cathode NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) to maintain an excellent capacity retention of 90% after 250 cycles and exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance at both high and low temperatures. The innovative structural design of anionic aggregates in dilute high&#8208;entropy electrolytes represents a pivotal advancement, offering substantial promise for the development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SIBs in the future.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Linkages as Base&#8208;Activated Sites in a Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon covalent organic framework (COF) (CityU&#8208;44) through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg reaction provided an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45), which displayed base&#8208;triggered active sites and a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, six times higher than that under neutral conditions.








Abstract
The photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under alkaline conditions is very important for biomass pretreatment and electronic industry. However, the proton&#8208;deficient nature of alkaline water and the intolerance of COF linkages in strong alkaline conditions lead to insufficient H2O2 production by most COF&#8208;based catalysts. Thus, developing novel COFs containing base&#8208;triggered active sites is an effective strategy to maintain structural rigidity and photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45) was prepared through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg post&#8208;synthetic reaction in a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon COF (CityU&#8208;44). The formation of the indole linkage maintains its crystallinity, reduces the bandgap, and results in the redshift of fluorescent emission. Moreover, CityU&#8208;45 reveals an alkaline&#8208;activated characteristic with a photocatalytic H2O2 rate up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, which is six times higher than that in neutral conditions. This research demonstrated that indole&#8208;linked COFs can be promising catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 generation under alkaline conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Post-synthetic modification of a nitro-containing sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon covalent organic framework (COF) (CityU-44) through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg reaction provided an indole-linked COF (CityU-45), which displayed base-triggered active sites and a photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at pH&#160;=&#160;13, six times higher than that under neutral conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under alkaline conditions is very important for biomass pretreatment and electronic industry. However, the proton-deficient nature of alkaline water and the intolerance of COF linkages in strong alkaline conditions lead to insufficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production by most COF-based catalysts. Thus, developing novel COFs containing base-triggered active sites is an effective strategy to maintain structural rigidity and photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, an indole-linked COF (CityU-45) was prepared through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg post-synthetic reaction in a nitro-containing sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon COF (CityU-44). The formation of the indole linkage maintains its crystallinity, reduces the bandgap, and results in the redshift of fluorescent emission. Moreover, CityU-45 reveals an alkaline-activated characteristic with a photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rate up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at pH&#160;=&#160;13, which is six times higher than that in neutral conditions. This research demonstrated that indole-linked COFs can be promising catalysts for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation under alkaline conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homoleptic Bismuth Alkynes: Isolable Reagents for Selective Alkynyl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of fully characterized homoleptic alkynyl bismuth compounds Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 is presented. Facile homolytic Bi&#8211;C bond cleavage grants access to alkynyl radicals, which have been employed in selective C&#8211;X bond formation (X&#160;=&#160;C, B, Se, Te). This complements existing strategies for alkynyl radical generation as it proceeds under mild and purely thermal conditions, without co&#8208;reagents or additives, and in the absence of transition metals.








Abstract
Alkynyl radicals represent highly attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but keep posing considerable challenges to researchers in the field. While their existence in interstellar space, in combustion processes, and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions has been documented, access under typical wet&#8208;chemical conditions remains limited. In this context, bismuth compounds are promising candidates as their ability to engage in controlled radical reactions has recently been brought into the focus of research efforts. Here, we present the first synthesis and full characterization of a series of homoleptic bismuth alkyne compounds, Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 (R&#160;=&#160;alkyl, silyl, aryl). The isolable compounds readily and selectively release alkynyl radicals, as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopic studies. This reactivity has been harnessed in Glaser&#8208;type C&#8211;C homocoupling reactions, as well as in C&#8211;C, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Se, and C&#8211;Te bond&#8208;forming events with external substrates, including transformations that commonly proceed through polar reaction pathways. The bismuth compounds complement existing strategies for the wet&#8208;chemical generation of alkynyl radicals in that they are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, avoid toxic components, proceed under mild conditions, can be operated via thermal activation, and do not require any additives or co&#8208;reagents.

In the Research Article (e202521837) by Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers, a workflow for constructing locally excited triplet states in charge transfer cocrystals is proposed and a universal descriptor developed. According to this descriptor, various room temperature phosphorescent cocrystals can be synthesized, and the longest room temperature phosphorescence lifetime of cocrystals can reach 1.223 s. These type of cocrystals can be applied to information encryption and time resolution optical logic gates.

         <title>Zn(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions: Access to Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfonimidate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides was reported, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, generating sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields, excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. A one&#8208;pot procedure enhanced the practicality. Quinuclidine as an additive facilitated a transformation from kinetic resolution to a dynamic kinetic process. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments exhibit a bifunctional activation mode. The reaction is featured with kinetic resolution characteristics via an SN2 pathway.








Abstract
The construction of stereogenic S(VI) centers remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis, despite incremental advances. The enantioselective transformation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides is rarely described for forming chiral S(VI)&#9472;O bonds and limited to covalent organocatalytic manners. Herein, we report the first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, affording sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields (up to 94% yield), excellent chemoselectivities (O&#8208;functionalization) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Enantioenriched sulfonimidate esters are stereospecifically transformed into chiral S(VI) derivatives, with the 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine unit acting as the leaving group. The practicality of this method is enhanced via a directed one&#8208;pot procedure of in situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl chloride from S(IV) sulfonamide. Furthermore, the addition of quinuclidine as an additive can trigger rapid racemization of sulfonimidoyl chloride, establishing a dynamic kinetic process instead of a kinetic resolution. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via an SN2 pathway with kinetic resolution characteristics. A bifunctional activation mode is elucidated by mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, in which Zn(II)&#8208;ligand complex activates the sulfonimidoyl chloride, while imidazolidine N&#8211;H forms a H&#8208;bond with the nitrogen atom in 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines.

Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2&#160;with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5&#160;with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9&#160;cluster core of zerovalent gold.

Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)Ca}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;NacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;](naph)(tmeda)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;with a non-charged body-centered cubic Au&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;cluster core of zerovalent gold.

         <title>Amination and Para&#8208;C&#9472;H Arylation of Aryl Fluorides Enabled by &#945;&#8208;Methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts generated from the halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl&#8208;palladium dimer [Pd(1&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and biarylphosphine ligands in combination with the base LiHMDS promote Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig type aminations and para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 60&#160;&#176;C. Their enabling performance is attributed to the efficient generation of monoligated Pd(0)&#8208;species.








Abstract
The C&#9472;F bond is among the strongest in organic molecules and can be cleaved only by few transition metal catalysts under harsh conditions or with highly reactive nucleophiles. We herein report that a methyl naphthyl (MeNAP) palladium bromide / BrettPhos catalyst with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) as the base promotes aminations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 40&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C to give primary, secondary, and tertiary anilines. A related catalyst system further enables para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of tritylated anilines with aryl fluorides, yielding biarylamines.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Geometry Engineering for High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Low Coercive Field in Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing molecular symmetry and geometry engineering, trigonal pyramidal cations with C3v symmetry adopted in ferroelectric hybrid metal halides undergo partial disorder transition to enable the highest Curie temperature up to decomposition temperature (530&#160;K) and exceptionally low coercive field (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K).








Abstract
Optimizing ferroelectric properties is critical for molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics toward practical applications, including enhanced saturation polarization (Ps), elevated Curie temperature (TC), and reduced coercive field (Ec). Recent advances in ferroelectrochemistry have provided efficient synthetic strategies to tailor these properties, with a focus on functionalizing organic components. However, the impact of combined molecular symmetry and geometry on ferroelectricity remains less understood. In this work, we construct a series of one&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric hybrid metal halides (HMHs) using C3v&#8208;symmetric trigonal pyramidal polar cations to systematically investigate how molecular symmetry and geometry modulate ferroelectric behavior. The model compound (TMS)PbI3 (TMS&#160;=&#160;trimethylsulfonium) exhibits ferroelectricity up to its decomposition temperature (530&#160;K), the highest among known HMH ferroelectrics, alongside an exceptionally low Ec (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K). We demonstrate that the unique C3v symmetry and trigonal pyramidal geometry of the TMS cation facilitate energy&#8208;favorable uniaxial rotation about the polar 3&#8208;fold axis and 90&#176; polarity flipping during disordering in the ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transition near 271&#160;K. This partial disorder transition underpins the remarkable high&#8208;temperature ferroelectric phase and low Ec. Selenium&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based analogs show similar properties with Ec values of 0.55 and 0.47&#160;kV cm&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Reversible Monoclinic Transition Buffering and Stepwise Uniform Delithiation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;modification of Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating stabilizes the buffer monoclinic phase in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. The regulated M&#8596;H transitions suppress lattice distortion, promote stepwise uniform delithiation, and prevent Li&#8208;sufficient/deficient phase segregation. This structural engineering yields superior cyclability with reduced voltage decay and enhanced thermal/air stability, offering a strategy to advance high&#8208;energy Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are promising high&#8208;energy cathodes but suffer from severe structural degradation during cycling, particularly due to irreversible phase transitions and interfacial instability. While extensive studies focus on the hexagonal (H) phase transition, the intermediate monoclinic (M) phase plays a critical yet overlooked role in mediating lattice strain and enabling ordered delithiation. Stabilizing the M phase remains challenging in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes due to linked bulk and surface degradation. Herein, we report stabilization of LiNiO2 by combining Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating, which respectively suppresses anisotropic lattice distortion by forming Li/Ni superlattices and provides uniform protection on primary particles. This dual&#8208;modification effectively inhibits NiO6 bond length/angle dispersion within M phase, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller activity and establishing a reversible transition buffer that accommodates lattice strain and guides moderated M&#8596;H conversion, thereby functioning as a structural bridge to ensure continuous symmetry recovery. The modified cathode achieves a stepwise uniform delithiation with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Li distribution, preventing separation into Li&#8208;sufficient and Li&#8208;deficient areas and delivering enhanced cycling stability with reduced voltage decay. This work demonstrates that M phase engineering is a promising strategy for developing ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes with high energy density and prolonged stability.

         <title>Ribosomal Synthesis of Topologically Defined Thioisoindole&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system&#8208;based strategy for ribosomal synthesis of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides is developed. The flexizyme substrate Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME is efficiently incorporated into FIT to generate ribosomal peptides bearing N&#8208;terminal Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc as the cyclization handle, which after mild deprotection undergo spontaneous cyclization with Cys and Lys to form TiB scaffolds. This platform enables sequence&#8208;diverse topologically bicyclic peptide generation and is fully compatible with mRNA display.








Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides are promising scaffolds for drug discovery due to their structural rigidity and high target specificity. Here, we report a strategy for in vitro ribosomal translation of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic peptides. Central to this approach is a newly developed flexizyme substrate, Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME, which features a semicarbazone&#8208;masked 2&#8208;nicotinoyl benzaldehyde sidechain. We show that this amino acid can be efficiently charged onto tRNA with flexizyme and incorporated into ribosomal peptides using a customized flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system. The semicarbazone group can be post&#8208;translationally removed under mild conditions, triggering spontaneous intramolecular cyclization to cysteine and lysine sidechains in the same substrate to yield thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides. This strategy was leveraged to synthesize structurally diverse bicyclic peptides with varying sequences and ring sizes. The method maintains the integrity of mRNA and is therefore compatible with mRNA display, which opens the possibility of constructing topologically defined bicyclic peptide libraries for therapeutic peptide discovery.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Flipping of a Nonproductive Substrate Binding Conformation Facilitates Hydroxynitrile Lyase Catalyzed Hydrocyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational interchange of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes are intrinsic to catalysis, yet their transient nature makes it elusive for understanding the substrate conformational dynamics. In the Research Article (e15778) by Yi&#8208;Lei Zhao, Hui&#8208;Lei Yu, and co&#8208;workers a &#8220;flipped&#8221; substrate binding conformation in the hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) is revealed. Crystallographic and computational analyses show that this non&#8208;productive state must reorganize before catalysis proceeds. Mutagenesis destabilizes this non&#8208;productive conformation, promoting conversion to the productively competent state and markedly enhancing enzymatic efficiency.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lead&#8208;Free Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Exhibiting Broad Absorption and Bright Golden Emission for LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden&#8208;emitting high&#8208;entropy organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6(TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium) was synthesized via room&#8208;temperature solution processing. This material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;excitable emission and demonstrates potential for LED and x&#8208;ray detection applications.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanomaterials are attractive for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties; however, lead toxicity and stability issues significantly limit their practical use. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) leverage multi&#8208;principal component synergy to form configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized solid solutions, exhibiting unique physicochemical properties and superior stability arising from atomic&#8208;scale chemical disorder and reconstructed local electronic states. Nevertheless, their luminescence efficiency often requires improvement. Here, we report the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid high&#8208;entropy perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6 (TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium). Exploiting the synergistic effects among five diverse B&#8208;site cations, this material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8211;excitable broadband emission, producing a distinct golden light. The study demonstrates that this material retains 80% of its initial photoluminescence intensity after 1 h of continuous ultraviolet irradiation and maintains 60% of its original emission intensity even when heated to 340&#160;K. Furthermore, its facile room&#8208;temperature synthesis facilitates promising applications, such as in light&#8208;emitting diodes and x&#8208;ray detection. These findings provide crucial insights for advancing the development of efficient and stable novel optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Deciphering Ball Milling Mechanochemistry via Molecular Simulations of Collision&#8208;Driven and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical activation in ball&#8208;milling mechanochemistry remains experimentally elusive, prompting the theoretical exploration in the Research Article (e202505263) by Ivan Halasz, Ana&#8208;Sun&#269;ana Smith, and co&#8208;workers. Using molecular simulations, mechanochemical impacts under neat and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding are modelled, capturing how kinetic energy from the impact drives crystal fragmentation into atoms, ions, and ion pairs, triggering product formation and agglomeration. It is shown that minimal liquid promotes reactivity, while excess stabilizes reactants. This framework enables rational optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions.

         <title>Outside front cover: Solution ALD of (CH3NH3)(PbI3) Perovskite Thin Films Yields Functional Quality and Stability Superior to Classical Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer deposition builds up solids in individual atomic steps by a cyclic repetition of successive surface reactions. In the Communication (e13903) by Julien Bachmann and co&#8208;workers this approach is adapted to form high&#8208;quality halide perovskite thin films from dissolved precursors. Pivalate ligands solubilize lead ions and deliver them to the surface, enabling rapid, controlled film growth. In situ investigations capture the moment of nucleation in the process of forming the semiconductor.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Industrial&#8208;Grade H2O2 Electrosynthesis via N/O&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanoreactors with Remarkable Yield and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating elemental doping and morphological engineering enhances the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) performance of carbon electrocatalysts, as reported by Cheng Tang, Jian Liu, Zhong&#8208;Shuai Wu, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article (e202519013). N/O dual&#8208;doping optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates, while hierarchical pores improve mass transfer and suppress H2O2 decomposition. These effects inhibit the competitive 4e&#8211; pathway, enabling sustainable H2O2 production with remarkable performance at industrial&#8208;grade current densities.

         <title>The Combination of Chiral Assembly and Chiral Template Effects Boosts Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that the hierarchical order of perovskite nanocrystal assemblies formed within a nanostructured, chal liquid&#8208;crystalline template exhibits extremely high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This is due to the helical arrangement of PNCs in the template voids and capitalizes on the inherent electrooptic properties of the template. Ultimately, this enables the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active thin films with practically relevant chiroptical functionality.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) represent a promising class of materials for display and light communication technologies, owing to their emission covering the entire visible range with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency. However, these materials suffer from low selectivity in the handedness of the emitted light, with most studies focusing on green emission. We address these issues by exploiting and broadening the scope of interactions between achiral PNCs and chiral organic templates. For this purpose, we select three types of PNCs with red, green, and blue emissions and introduce them into a chiral liquid&#8208;crystalline matrix in the form of composite thin films. Electron microscopy confirmed the assembly of PNCs within nanoscale gaps formed by supramolecular, liquid crystalline structures. The obtained composites displayed a CPL dissymmetry factor&#160;glum&#160;up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.24. The highly dissymmetric CPL properties were found to result from an interplay between two effects: chiral assembly of PNCs within a chiral environment (intrinsic) and the selective filtering by the chiral matrix. This system enables control over the dominant factors by adjusting the CPL spectral region and type of particle assembly, providing thin film materials with highly dissymmetric and spectrally tunable CPL responses.

         <title>Characterisation of the N&#8208;Methyltransferase SgPsmC: Application in the Kinetic Resolution of Pyrroloindolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC was characterised and applied in the kinetic resolution (KR) of easily obtainable pyrroloindolines. Substitution at 3a&#8208;position proved to be a principal determinant for the enzyme's enantioselectivity. While moving toward laboratory scale, the reaction was coupled with a methionine adenosyl transferase for in situ generation of S&#8208;adenosyl methionine, allowing the KR to proceed without any background reaction.








Abstract
Many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds bear the pyrroloindoline scaffold, highlighting the importance of the heterocyclic motif. Here, we aim at expanding the toolset for the selective synthesis of pyrroloindolines by characterising and employing the N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC from Streptomyces griseofuscus, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, in a selective kinetic resolution of pyrroloindolines performed at a laboratory preparative scale.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Transfer Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation Enables Regiodivergent, Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all reagent atoms, including the leaving group, are incorporated into the products. This atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol enables the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, providing a catalyst&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent, and stereoselective access to trifluoromethylated homoallylic scaffolds.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a widely used strategy for stereoselective formation of C&#9472;C bonds. Yet, conventional methods often exhibit poor atom economy as the leaving group is generally wasted. Herein, we report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all the atoms of the reagents are incorporated into the final products. The catalytic platform enables regiodivergent, stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, where the regiochemical outcome is directed by the selective catalytic activation of one or the other electrophilic partner. The resulting atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol provides a regiocontrollable access to homoallylic trifluoromethylated compounds from a common set of electrophilic starting materials.

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Light&#8208;Driven Active Transport of Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light&#8208;driven primary active transport system based on an azobenzene carrier that drives uphill ion movement across phase&#8208;separated compartments. Tunable ion&#8208;pairing enables selective co&#8208;transport under buffered conditions, advancing synthetic systems that emulate biological ion pumps.








Abstract
Transport across compartments is essential for biology to drive its vital processes. Chemists have developed synthetic transport systems, focusing mainly on passive transport, where cargo species move along a concentration gradient. However, active transport&#8212;moving substances against a concentration gradient&#8212;remains a challenge. Light is a promising energy source for driving active transport due to its precise spatiotemporal control, high selectivity, and operation without waste accumulation. Yet only a few examples of light&#8208;driven active transport have been reported: these systems rely on specific host&#8211;guest interactions, which enable the transport of one particular species in each case. Here, we present a general, robust strategy for light&#8208;driven active transport of charged cargos, based on light&#8208;controlled membrane permeability and charge complementarity. Positively charged azobenzene derivatives act as light&#8208;responsive carriers, and their photoisomerization is coupled to transport across a liquid membrane by a molecular ratchet mechanism. Notably, their transport drives active transport of negatively charged cargos by forming ion pairs. This system can transport various anions, which are simply added as salt, and it functions even in buffered solutions. This approach utilizing charge complementarity is compatible with active transport driven by other energy sources and holds potential for biomedical applications and smart materials.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling of Ethers to Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed double C&#9472;O bond activation has been achieved. Diverse ethers were successfully transformed into 1,2&#8208;diarylethanes and linear alkyl arenes. This protocol is extended toward synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Experimental mechanistic investigation and DFT calculations revealed the involvement of radical intermediacy.








Abstract
Alkanes have extensive applications in diverse fields and their natural abundance is dwindling. Ethers are prevalently present in biomolecules and synthetic compounds; however, despite recent progress in their transformations they are considered as unreactive functionalities, and widely used as solvents in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Hence, catalytic synthesis of alkanes from bio&#8208;ample ethers is highly desirable. A simple cobalt&#8208;catalyzed double C&#8211;O bond activation of ethers is attained now; diverse symmetrical and unsymmetrical arylmethyl ethers (ArCH2OCH2Ar&#8242;) are selectively transformed to 1,2&#8208;diaryl alkanes. This protocol is extended toward unsymmetrical arylmethyl alkyl ethers which furnished linear alkyl arenes. Synthesis of biologically active compounds is also achieved utilizing this catalytic method. Consumption of ethers in catalytic deoxygenative coupling to alkanes follows first&#8208;order kinetics. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reactions proceed through molecular intermediates and involve arylmethyl and alkyl radicals. DFT analysis reveals that the in situ generated radical either abstracts a proton from silane, resulting in C&#8211;H bond formation or attacks the aryl silyl ether, leading to C&#8211;C coupling. The reaction mechanism involves intermediates with different spin multiplicities and spin crossover through minimum energy crossing points (MECPs).

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Induced Crystal Symmetry Breaking and Lattice Distortion in Hybrid Cu(I) Halides for Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by symmetry&#8208;breaking principles, we developed a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to engineer asymmetric structures in Cu(I) halides, enhancing lattice distortion and charge transfer for superior STE emission. This approach achieved a 138% improvement in emission efficiency with a near&#8208;unity PLQY of 99%, a 187% boost in radioluminescence, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging (29 lp/mm) in(C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 single&#8208;crystal films.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides have emerged as promising scintillators due to their efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission. However, the radiative efficiency of STE emission is mainly determined by structural distortion, making it challenging to precisely control the distortion for optimal luminescence. Here, inspired by symmetry&#8208;breaking principles, we developed a universal asymmetric structure transformation strategy through mixed&#8208;ligand engineering to modulate structural distortion and enhance intramolecular charge transfer, thereby boosting radiative STE emission. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that this mixed&#8208;ligand approach effectively tunes bond lengths and angles, intensifying structural distortion while simultaneously promoting charge transfer for improved luminescence. By optimizing structural distortion, the (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 crystal achieved a 138% enhancement in emission efficiency with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99% PLQY). Consequently, the &#8203;radioluminescence intensity increased by 187%, reaching 2.67 times light output that of (Lu, Y)2SiO5: Ce (LYSO). Owing to this remarkable improvement in radioluminescence, large&#8208;area (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6 single&#8208;crystal films with low light scattering exhibited outstanding X&#8208;ray imaging performance, achieving a spatial resolution exceeding 29 lp/mm, 2.64 times higher than that of (C8H20N)1(C12H28N)1Cu4Br6@PMMA films (11 lp/mm). This work establishes mixed&#8208;ligand engineering as an effective approach for structural asymmetry design and demonstrates the material's potential for advanced radiation detection and imaging.

         <title>Pure Molecular Inorganic Rings: Mixed Group 14/15 Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of novel mixed group 14/15 metallacycles incorporating a transition&#8208;metal is described. All of the presented compounds were obtained by reduction of an organometallic Mo2E2 tetrahedrane using Si(I) and Ge(I) compounds, respectively. The size of the obtained metallacycles (three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208;membered rings) is strongly dependent on the combination of the tetrel as well as the pnictogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic study on the reactivity of the homodipnictogen tetrahedrane complexes [{Cp&#8216;Mo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;E2)] (E &#9552; P, As, Sb; Cp&#8216; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H4tBu) towards the disilylene [LPhSi]2 and digermylene [LPhGe]2 (LPh&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2) is presented. Depending on the specific combination of tetrel and pnictogen atom, a variety of novel silicon&#8208;pnictogen and germanium&#8208;pnictogen heterocycles in different bonding situations were obtained. This is a significant development, as these metallacycles are unprecedented and offer new possibilities for further reactivities. These three&#8208; to five&#8208;membered pure inorganic heterocycles include one Mo, one or two tetrel, and one or two pnictogen atoms in each case. Especially for the heavier pnictogen Sb, this cyclization behavior forming novel three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered Si&#8211;Sb as well as five&#8208;membered Ge&#8211;Sb ring systems has not been observed so far. These results present unique examples of heavy group 14/15 heterocycles.

         <title>Support&#8208;Induced Interfacial Effects Steer Methanol Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction by Immobilized Cobalt Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immobilizing CoPc on a carbon support switches its CO2 reduction selectivity from CO to CH3OH. Multiscale simulations reveal that the support actively modulates the catalytic environment by inducing desolvation of bottom layer of CoPc, which lowers the protonation barrier while leaving CO desorption nearly unaffected.








Abstract
Achieving product selectivity in multistep electrocatalysis requires delicately tuning the stability of key reaction intermediates to modulate the energetics of competing pathways. The conversion of CO2 by cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) presents a stark puzzle in this context; while solution&#8208;phase CoPc exclusively produces CO, its immobilization on carbon nanotube support triggers a substantial and unusual switch to methanol. Here, using multiscale simulations, we resolve this outstanding puzzle. We demonstrate that the carbon support is not a passive anchor but an active modulator of the catalytic environment. It functions by shielding one face of the CoPc molecule from the aqueous solvent, which substantially lowers the kinetic barrier for protonation while having little effect on CO desorption, thereby activating methanol production. Interfacial electric fields (EF) and cations further enhance this effect. Our findings establish support&#8208;induced desolvation as a new, rational design guideline for kinetically steering complex electrocatalytic reactions, providing a clear mechanistic basis for the unique reactivity of heterogenized molecular catalysts.

         <title>Crystalline 90&#176;&#8208;Twisted Carbon&#8208;Centered Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; Diradical Derived from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis of a triplet TME analog [(IPrMe&#8208;CDY)2C]2 (3) derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Unlike transient TME, diradical 3 shows indefinite stability under an inert atmosphere. Consequently, our findings not only present an opportunity for further exploration of the electronic properties associated with TME but also enable potential applications in molecular magnetic materials.








Abstract
Diradicals, molecules with two unpaired electrons, are crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms, bond formation, and bond dissociation. Beyond their fundamental importance, they are increasingly studied for potential applications in batteries, luminescent materials, solar cells, and organic spintronic devices. As an essential property, determining the electronic ground state&#8212;singlet or triplet&#8212;of diradicals is critical for understanding their reactivity, physical properties, and spin&#8211;spin interactions. Tetramethyleneethane (TME), a prototypical disjoint non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical, has long attracted attention; however, its ground state remains controversial because it is highly unstable. Here, by appending four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;functionalized p&#8208;phenylene units to an olefin skeleton, we prepared a TME analog that exhibits high stability in both solution and solid state at room temperature. Experimental characterization and quantum chemical calculations reveal that the isolated diradical adopts a triplet ground state, a 90&#176;&#8208;twisted conformation with D2d symmetry, and a central C&#9472;C bond length of 1.498(5) &#197;. Preliminary studies further demonstrate the unique reactivity of this carbon&#8208;centered diradical. This strategy offers a general approach for the rational design and isolation of other highly reactive diradicals, facilitating deeper insights into their electronic structures and properties.

Binuclear PtII complexes bridged by 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands exhibit strong 3MMLCT emission in the red to NIR region with emission quantum yields up to 0.87 and radiative decay rate as high as 6.69&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1. Red and near&#8208;infrared OLEDs based on these emitters as dopants have an EQEmax of 32.7%, efficiency roll&#8208;off of 2.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and LT95 &gt; 26&#160;250&#160;h at L0 of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Platinum(II) metal&#8211;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) emitters have high radiative decay rates and tunable emission energies but their stability under device operation conditions is a critical issue. Here we describe a new class of substituted 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine bridged binuclear PtII complexes [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] that display strong 3MMLCT emission in the red to NIR region with emission quantum yields up to 0.87 and radiative decay rate as high as 6.69&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1. Compared with the conventional formamidinate bridging ligand, the asymmetric N and O donor sites of the R&#8208;N^O bridging ligand can form strong Pt&#9472;N and Pt&#9472;O bonds by modulating the electron distribution on the N^O bridging ligand, thus forming a binuclear PtII complex with enhanced stability. OLEDs based on [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] emitters as dopants have an EQEmax of 32.7%, efficiency roll&#8208;off of 2.4% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and LT95 &gt;26&#160;200&#160;h at L0 of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The [Pt2(R&#8208;N^O)] complex&#8208;sensitized red hyper&#8208;OLEDs with CIE coordinates of (0.65, 0.35) had an FWHM of 35&#160;nm (0.11&#160;eV) and an outstanding device lifetime of LT95 &gt;23&#160;300&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The co&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved an EQEmax of 17.5% at 734&#160;nm emission and excellent operational stability with LT99 value of 25&#160;873&#160;h at an initial radiance of 1000&#160;mW Sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This highlights the practical commercial application of 3MMLCT emitters in OLEDs technology.

         <title>Tackling the Reactivity of Propadiene: Palladium Metallaphotoredox Dual Catalyzed Multi&#8208;Component Allylation and Dienylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented herein that propadiene can chemodivergently form either an allylic moiety or a dienylic moiety under Pd catalysis. Embedding this reactivity pattern into photocatalysis with DHP as the initial radical source and styrene derivatives as the initial acceptor leads to multi&#8208;component allylation and dienylation. 








Abstract
Catalytic transformations of feedstock chemicals into value&#8208;added products are a long&#8208;standing challenge. A side product of the steam&#8208;cracking process &#8211; propadiene &#8211; which is formed in 2.5&#160;x&#160;105 t/y &#8208; regardless of its potentially rich chemistry &#8208; is usually wasted by burning it. To make more economical and sustainable use of valuable carbon atoms from feeds stocks, herein we report a palladium metallaphotoredox dual catalyzed multi&#8208;component allylation and dienylation of styrene derivatives with propadiene as either an allylation or a dienylation reagent. The chemoselectivity for both directions are higher than 20:1 and pronounced functional group tolerance has been elucidated in both cases. Gram scale synthesis and orthogonal reactivities towards thermo allylation demonstrate the practicability of our protocols. Moreover, DFT calculation suggested an outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination at a PdI complex to be the most energetically favored route for both directions.

         <title>Manipulating P States of Organophosphine Polymers to Enhance Multi&#8208;Channel Synergetic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organophosphine polymers with different P states are prepared to explore the influence of intrinsic n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* states for RTP properties. Compared with n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* competitive PAM&#8208;TPPO and n&#960;*&#8208;excluded PAM&#8208;TPP+, PAM&#8208;TPP exhibits n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* synergy, which can not only promote ISC and Tn* population but also inhibit the influence of excitation wavelength on the RTP performance, thereby achieving the best RTP performance.








Abstract
According to El&#8208;Sayed's rule, n&#960;* component would facilitate intersystem crossing (ISC) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of organic molecules. However, purposeful molecular design still faces big challenge due to insufficient understanding of inherent effect of n&#960;* states on RTP. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;containing groups of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide, and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are introduced in polyacrylamide matrix, corresponding to PAM&#8208;TPP, PAM&#8208;TPPO, and PAM&#8208;TPP+. It shows that phosphorus (&#8220;P&#8221;) states determine excited&#8208;state compositions of these polymers and, more importantly, result in different RTP processes. p&#8211;&#960; conjugation between P atom and phenyls in PAM&#8208;TPP integrates ISC acceleration and triplet convergence to stabilize triplet states (Tn*). In contrast, P&#160;=&#160;O localized n&#960;* state of PAM&#8208;TPPO competes with &#960;&#960;* states of phenyls, while PAM&#8208;TPP+ has pure &#960;&#960;* states. In contrast to RTP&#8208;free PAM&#8208;TPPO and PAM&#8208;TPP+, with RTP dependent on 1&#960;&#960;* excitation, PAM&#8208;TPP achieves the best RTP performance, including the longest lifetime beyond 250&#160;ms, the highest efficiency reaching 10.8%, and the limited excitation dependence, owing to its more than fourfold larger ISC rate constants reaching 10&#8722;7 s&#8722;1 and doubled RTP proportions. This work clarifies the importance of n&#960;*&#8211;&#960;&#960;* synergy for developing high&#8208;performance RTP materials.

         <title>Synthetic Motifs for Understanding Lewis Acid Interactions with Persulfides and Thioselenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using isolated dichalcogenides as precursors, we report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of Zn persulfide and thioselenide complexes. 77Se NMR shows distinct impacts to electronic structure and reactivity between different thioselenides coordinated to different Lewis acids.








Abstract
Persulfides (RSS&#8211;) and thioselenides (RSSe&#8211;) play important roles in biological S and Se transfer reactions, and their interactions with Lewis acidic moieties exert control over reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis and reactivity of mononuclear Zn2+ persulfide and thioselenide complexes from a unified synthetic strategy of using isolable dichalcogenide precursors. Highlighting the benefits of replacing S with Se, we use 77Se NMR spectroscopy to reveal the effects of Lewis acid coordination (K+, Na+, Zn2+) on the electronic environment of the terminal Se of the thioselenide (R&#8211;S&#946;&#8211;Se&#945;&#8211;). Coordination of RSSe&#8211; to Zn2+ polarizes the Se&#9472;S bond, rendering the internal sulfur atom (R&#8211;S&#946;&#8211;Se&#945;&#8211;) susceptible to nucleophilic attack and resulting in selenide (Se2&#8211;) release. We also prepared a mononuclear Zn2+ persulfide complex and probed differences in persulfide nucleophilicity when compared to the parent thiolate. Alkylation of the Zn2+ persulfide is considerably faster than the Zn2+ thiolate, supporting the proposed nucleophilicity enhancement of persulfides due to the &#945;&#8208;effect, and&#160;providing new insights into persulfide reactivity when coordinated to metals. Taken together, these investigations highlight the utility of small molecule synthetic models in advancing insights into the biological chemistry of metal dichaclogenides.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;). Coordination of RSSe&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; polarizes the Se&#9472;S bond, rendering the internal sulfur atom (R&#8211;S&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Se&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;) susceptible to nucleophilic attack and resulting in selenide (Se&lt;sup&gt;2&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;) release. We also prepared a mononuclear Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; persulfide complex and probed differences in persulfide nucleophilicity when compared to the parent thiolate. Alkylation of the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; persulfide is considerably faster than the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; thiolate, supporting the proposed nucleophilicity enhancement of persulfides due to the &#945;-effect, and&#160;providing new insights into persulfide reactivity when coordinated to metals. Taken together, these investigations highlight the utility of small molecule synthetic models in advancing insights into the biological chemistry of metal dichaclogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Multicellular Inter&#8208;Communication Systems Using a Synthetic Conformation Inducible Kinase Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic conformation&#8208;inducible kinase receptor (synCIKER) system is developed by engineering the extracellular domain of a receptor with ligand&#8208;responsive moieties and rewiring intracellular signaling pathways for prescribed transgene expressions. This design allows cell receptor degradation, T cell&#8208;mediated lysis, intercellular logic&#8208;gated gene editing and macrophage polarization in a multi&#8208;cellular system. 








Abstract
Synthetic multicellular inter&#8208;communication systems are essential for understanding multicellular behaviors and developing cell&#8208;based therapeutics. Synthetic receptors that allow programming of multicellular intercommunications through spatiotemporal control with light or chemical ligands are highly desirable but remain challenging. Here we propose a new strategy for designing multicellular inter&#8208;communication systems using a synthetic conformation&#8208;inducible kinase receptor (synCIKER). The synCIKER system is developed by engineering the extracellular domain of a tyrosine kinase receptor with domains responsive to inputs of chemical ligand, light or soluble protein, and rewiring the endogenous intracellular signaling pathways for prescribed transgene expression. The synCIKER system is demonstrated to sense these inputs, and generate customized secretory proteins for programming receiver cell behaviours such as surface receptor degradation and T cell&#8208;mediated lysis in target cells. We also demonstrate the ability of synCIKER to construct cascade systems and reconfigure intelligent intercellular Boolean logic gates of OR, AND and INHIBIT for activating gene editing in receiver cells. The synCIKER platform is further exploited to modulate bi&#8208;directional polarization of macrophages in a multi&#8208;cellular system, highlighting its potential for designing synthetic intercellular communication systems for programming multicellular behaviors.

         <title>Optimized In&#8208;Solution and Gas&#8208;Phase Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Interactome Mapping by DSBSO&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Linking Mass Spectrometry</title>

We developed a rapid, high&#8208;throughput XL&#8211;MS workflow using the enrichable azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO cross&#8208;linker and StageTip&#8208;based SCX fractionation. It drastically reduces preparation time and enhances sensitivity, providing a scalable platform for high&#8208;throughput profiling of protein interaction networks.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) allows characterizing protein structures and interactions in highly complex samples. The enrichable disuccinimidyl bissulfoxide (DSBSO) cross&#8208;linker has enabled comprehensive XL&#8211;MS studies of human cells. However, existing DSBSO workflows demand multi&#8208;day sample preparation with high input requirements and provide insufficient detection sensitivity. Here, we systematically optimize the in solution and gas&#8208;phase chemistry of azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO&#8208;based XL&#8211;MS. Importantly, we reduce sample preparation time to 10 h and introduce StageTip&#8208;based strong cation exchange (SCX) separation to concomitantly remove nonvolatile salts and interfering contaminants. Applying our streamlined SCX protocol to intact Bacillus subtilis reduced sample consumption 15&#8208;fold compared to conventional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography&#8208;based azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO XL&#8208;MS and doubled the identification numbers, yielding 3,209 protein interactions at a 1% false&#8208;discovery rate. These results illustrate that our optimized workflow unites speed, analytical depth, and resource efficiency, making XL&#8211;MS amenable to high&#8208;throughput interactome profiling of complex biological samples.

         <title>Selective Reductive Amination of Carbonyls to Primary Amines Under Ambient Conditions Over Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) enables highly selective reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived and other carbonyls with NH3 and H2 to affordprimary amines with up to 99% selectivity under ambient conditions (25&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;atm).








Abstract
The synthesis of organic amines via reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived carbonyl compounds is an important target for sustainable chemical industries. The control of selectivity for the formation of primary amines versus secondary amines is challenging, and high temperature and pressures using H2 are required to generate the desired selectivity. Herein, we report the highly selective reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones by NH3 and H2 over Rh/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) to form primary amines with a selectivity of up to 99% under ambient conditions. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals that the Rh species not only promote the hydrogenation process, but also catalyzes the ammonolysis of the Schiff base intermediate, facilitating the selective synthesis of primary amines. This protocol achieves selective reductive amination at 25&#160;&#176;C and 1&#160;atm, providing an energy&#8208;efficient route to a broad spectrum of amines.

         <title>Local Electric Field&#8208;Driven Reaction Pathway Regulation via Ru Single Atoms on Highly Curved Carbon Sphere for Stable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes &#8220;microenvironmental regulation of active sites&#8221; strategy to overcome low activity utilization caused by disordered reaction pathways for conventional&#160;single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in Li&#8211;O2 batteries. By leveraging the tailored metal&#8208;support interactions of unique SACs, function&#8208;driven oriented assembly of discharge intermediates into 3D cylindrical&#8208;like products is achieved, presenting a novel design paradigm for SAC systems towardspractical Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are extensively employed in Li&#8211;O2 batteries owing to their exceptional atomic utilization efficiency and precise active&#8208;site control, which collectively enhance battery performance. However, weak metal&#8208;support interactions impede effective anchoring and electronic state modulation, leading to suboptimal catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Herein, we report a Ru single&#8208;atom/onion&#8208;like carbon sphere (Ru SACs/OCS) catalyst designed to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This enhancement stems from the interplay of the local electric field induced by the tip effect, facilitating rapid mass transport of reactive species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results demonstrate that precise modulation of substrate nanostructure curvature significantly amplifies the local electric field intensity surrounding SACs on the support surface. This augmentation elevates surface charge density and active&#8208;site concentration of the catalyst, thereby promoting the preferential disproportionation of reaction intermediates at the catalyst surface. The proposed strategy offers a streamlined and effective approach to engineer SACs with highly curved heterostructures, enabling enhanced catalytic reactions in metal&#8722;air battery technologies.

         <title>Inner&#8208;Axial Chlorine Engineering Enables Efficient and Selective Phenol Electrocatalytic Upcycling to Benzoquinone on Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst efficiently upcycled aqueous phenol to valuable para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ), with CoN4 sites electronically regulated by inner&#8208;axial chlorine coordination. This modification facilitated charge transfer, optimized reaction thermodynamics, and synergistically promoted phenol adsorption and p&#8208;BQ desorption.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upcycling of aqueous phenol into value&#8208;added para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) provides a promising route for synergistic wastewater treatment and sustainable chemical synthesis. Nevertheless, previous attempts have primarily relied on noble metal&#8208;based (e.g., Pd, Ru) electrocatalysts, but struggled with high costs and low selectivity. We, herein, report a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst comprising carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported CoN4 sites coordinated with inner&#8208;axial chloride atoms (Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl), delivering 92.4% phenol conversion and 83.7% p&#8208;BQ yield under mild conditions. The superior electrocatalytic performance stems from inner&#8208;axial coordination of Cl, which fine&#8208;tunes the CoN4 site microenvironment and electronic structure. This modification enhances charge&#8208;transfer capacity, optimizes oxidation thermodynamics, and facilitates phenol adsorption and p&#8208;BQ desorption. The proposed electrocatalytic system with the Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst, maintains&#160;&gt;&#160;80.3% phenol conversion and&#160;&gt;&#160;70.7% p&#8208;BQ yield over 10 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, integrating the Co&#8208;CNT&#8208;Cl catalyst into a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer enables efficiently operational stability. This work establishes a potential and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalytic approach to valorize phenolic wastewater through resource recovery.

&lt;p&gt;The Co-CNT-Cl catalyst efficiently upcycled aqueous phenol to valuable &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-benzoquinone (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ), with CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites electronically regulated by inner-axial chlorine coordination. This modification facilitated charge transfer, optimized reaction thermodynamics, and synergistically promoted phenol adsorption and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ desorption.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic upcycling of aqueous phenol into value-added &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-benzoquinone (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ) provides a promising route for synergistic wastewater treatment and sustainable chemical synthesis. Nevertheless, previous attempts have primarily relied on noble metal-based (e.g., Pd, Ru) electrocatalysts, but struggled with high costs and low selectivity. We, herein, report a noble-metal-free catalyst comprising carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites coordinated with inner-axial chloride atoms (Co-CNT-Cl), delivering 92.4% phenol conversion and 83.7% &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ yield under mild conditions. The superior electrocatalytic performance stems from inner-axial coordination of Cl, which fine-tunes the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site microenvironment and electronic structure. This modification enhances charge-transfer capacity, optimizes oxidation thermodynamics, and facilitates phenol adsorption and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ desorption. The proposed electrocatalytic system with the Co-CNT-Cl catalyst, maintains&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;80.3% phenol conversion and&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;70.7% &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-BQ yield over 10 consecutive cycles.

         <title>Water Networks as Hydrophobic Recognition Motifs in Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic groups can strengthen confined water networks, promoting order that propagates through the protein structure and drives recognition, creating a paradoxical hydrophobic binding hot spot. Polar groups are rejected because they disrupt the network, destabilizing the protein structure.








Abstract
The hydrophobic effect is a central force in molecular recognition, typically attributed to the ordering of water molecules around apolar groups. Hydrophobic interaction sites on proteins are therefore readily predicted based on surface polarity. Yet, in the bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4), a well&#8208;known hydrophobic hot spot is paradoxically lined by a network of water molecules. Here we combine binding assays, structural data, molecular dynamics, and free&#8208;energy calculations to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that the water network functions as a hydrophobic recognition motif that cannot accommodate polar groups without disruption. Instead, as the protein pre&#8208;organizes the water network, apolar groups can bind with minimal entropic cost. In turn, they reinforce the surrounding hydrogen&#8208;bond network, limiting the mobility of the entire protein&#8211;water assembly. With this perspective, we identify water networks potentially functioning as hydrophobic motifs in other pharmacological targets, revealing a general but overlooked recognition element with broad implications in drug discovery and protein design.

         <title>Bifunctional Aziridines from Photochemically Generated FSO2NH2 for SuFEx Diversification of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically generated FSO2NH2 serves as a safe, practical nitrene precursor for Rh&#8208;catalyzed aziridination of alkenes, granting access to previously inaccessible fluorosulfonyl aziridines. These bifunctional electrophiles merge aziridine ring strain with SuFEx reactivity to provide a modular platform toward aliphatic sulfamoyl fluoride derivatives and ultimately S(VI)&#8208;containing molecules including sulfamides and sulfamate esters.








Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as ubiquitous reactive motifs in fields ranging from medicinal chemistry to materials science, with applications as chemical warheads and as clickable units via Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx). However, methods for introducing sulfamoyl fluorides, the nitrogen&#8208;containing congeners, into functional&#8208;group rich scaffolds remain scarce. Herein, we report the synthesis of fluorosulfonyl aziridines from FSO2NH2 as a versatile and modular platform for alkene diversification. A safe and practical synthesis of FSO2NH2 was optimized via photodegradation of fluorosulfonyl azide (FSO2N3) in solution, enabling the development of a Rh&#8208;catalyzed aziridination with a broad alkene scope that merges the innate reactivity of the strained heterocycle with the modularity of SuFEx click chemistry. The unprecedented bifunctional electrophile was exploited in selective reactions with a wide array of nucleophiles under mild conditions, delivering sulfamoyl fluorides as well as S(VI)&#8208;containing linkages of pharmaceutical relevance, including sulfamides and sulfamate esters.

         <title>Insight into the Behavior of Interstitial Electrons in CuZn Alloy&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) employing CuZn&#8211;COF&#8211;OH catalysts with interstitial electrons of low work function and high mobility has been optimized to reduce coupling energy barriers and streamline reaction pathways, thereby achieving significant catalytic activity with high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) (&#8764;79%) and industrial&#8208;scale current density (&gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
The development of application&#8208;oriented, highly active, and selective CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrocatalysts for high value&#8208;added products is expected to achieve carbon neutrality and solve the problem of energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based catalysts, as the most promising catalysts for high value&#8208;added product generation, were often limited by slow CO generation and weak CO adsorption in practical applications. Guided by theoretical screening, herein, an atomic&#8208;scale CuZn alloy cluster configuration was manipulated on covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and its CO2RR performance was further improved by the regulation of the electron&#8208;donor functional groups. Through systematic characterization and theoretical simulations, we for the first time demonstrate and quantify the interstitial electrons in CuZn alloy clusters under the regulation of electron&#8208;giving groups. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and simulation results reveal that the behavior of interstitial electrons with low work function and high mobility occupy the high&#8208;energy orbital of the metal and easily transfer to *CO, therefore, the *CO is hydrogenated to *COH before coupling, and then the coupling energy barrier and path are optimized. Due to these attributes, the as&#8208;developed CuZn alloy&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst (CuZn&#8211;COF&#8211;OH) exhibits significantly improved activity and selectivity, with &gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 industrial&#8208;grade current density and ethylene Faraday efficiency of up to &#8764;79% at&#160;&#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE. This study provides innovative avenues and insights for the design and development of application&#8208;oriented atomic&#8208;scale catalysts.

         <title>Perfectly Linear &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene with Near&#8208;Ideal Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust bis&#8208;borane initiator, 1,5&#8208;(bis&#8208;borinane)pentane (1,5&#8208;BBP), for the controlled synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy polymethylene (PM) via C1 polymerization. Through optimized monomer purification and carefully tailored polymerization conditions, we obtained perfectly linear PM chains&#8212;completely free of side&#8208;branching, precisely controlled molar masses, narrow polydispersity indices, and crystallinity approaching the theoretical maximum.








Abstract
A novel 1,5&#8208;(bis&#8208;borinane)pentane (1,5&#8208;BBP) has been developed for polyhomologation (C1 polymerization), enabling the synthesis of well&#8208;defined &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy polymethylene (PM) with controlled molar masses and narrow polydispersity at elevated temperatures. The structural integrity and complete difunctionality of the PM were confirmed by 1H NMR, 11B NMR, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF MS), and SEC analyses. Achieving perfectly linear polyethylene (PE), an analog to PM, without branching remains a longstanding synthetic challenge, as even trace defects disrupt lamellar packing and reduce crystallinity. We address this limitation through the introduction of a monomer purification strategy for dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide in C1 polymerization that, for the first time, reduces residual branching to&#160;&lt;0.04%, as confirmed by quantitative 13C NMR. The resulting nascent PM exhibits exceptional properties, including enthalpies of fusion up to 290 J&#183;g&#8722;1, melting temperatures of 138 &#176;C&#8211;143.15 &#176;C, and crystallinity values of 93.8%&#8211;99.1% (DSC) and 92.0%&#8211;95.9% (WAXS). Solid&#8208;state 2D 1H&#8208;13C cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinningwide&#8208;line separation (CP&#8211;MAS WISE) NMR spectra further confirm predominantly crystalline domains with minimal amorphous content. This study demonstrates that precise control over initiator design, monomer purity, and reaction conditions enables &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;terminated PM with crystallinity approaching the theoretical limits.

The resulting nascent PM exhibits exceptional properties, including enthalpies of fusion up to 290 J&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, melting temperatures of 138 &#176;C&#8211;143.15 &#176;C, and crystallinity values of 93.8%&#8211;99.1% (DSC) and 92.0%&#8211;95.9% (WAXS).

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C cross-polarization magic angle spinningwide-line separation (CP&#8211;MAS WISE) NMR spectra further confirm predominantly crystalline domains with minimal amorphous content. This study demonstrates that precise control over initiator design, monomer purity, and reaction conditions enables &#945;,&#969;-hydroxy-terminated PM with crystallinity approaching the theoretical limits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvation Entropy as a Lever for Steering the Macroscopic Properties of a Functional Supramolecular Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transition between the two fully&#8208;characterized states of a supramolecular helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer (represented as blue and light pink stacks) can be predictably varied over 85&#160;K by changing the nature and amount of cosolvent; entropy of solvation (schematized as solvents of different sizes) is the main lever to tune the macroscopic properties of the resulting polymers. 








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;solute interactions are utterly important in supramolecular polymers (SPs), yet the high responsivity of SPs to solvent polarity makes it challenging to play on other solvation effects to tune their macroscopic properties in a rational manner. Herein, we report the characterization at various scales of the assembly properties of a C2&#8208;symmetric benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide monomer with two (1S)&#8208;methylheptyl moieties and one diphenylphosphino group as lateral chains. Our investigation reveals a highly cooperative structural transition between two SP states, which can exquisitely be tuned by solvents of similar polarities, leading to variation of the transition temperature (T*) over a range of 85&#160;K. The structural transition was detected in 4 pure solvents and 13 toluene/cosolvent mixtures; a fair relationship is determined between T* and the solvent molar volume. The transition is only weakly favored by enthalpy (by ca. 2&#160;kJ.mol&#8722;1 at 286&#160;K). However, minimization of the entropic cost leads to a notable increase in the T*. This allows a fine tuning of the thermothickening and catalytic properties of the resulting SPs auguring that solvation, and notably solvation entropy, may constitute an important lever for steering SPs structure and properties.

         <title>Spatially Separated C&#8211;C Coupling and Protonation on Cl&#8208;Bridged Ti&#8211;Ag Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>

         <dc:description>
Cl&#8208;bridged Ti&#9472;Ag dual&#8208;site (Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag) catalysts enable photocatalytic efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion via spatially separating C&#9472;C bond formation and active hydrogen generation: Ti sites adsorb and activate CO2/*CO, single&#8208;atom Ag accelerates H2O dissociation to supply active hydrogen, whereas the Cl separates Ti&#8211;Ag dual sites spatially to make *CO dimerization thermodynamically favorable than deep hydrogenation in the crucial step.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective reduction of CO2 to C2H4 conversion is bottlenecked by the concurrent demands for intermediate protonation and C&#8211;C coupling. Herein, we constructed a chlorine (Cl)&#8208;bridged Ti&#8211;Ag dual&#8208;site catalysts to overcome above issues. The introduction of Cl on Ti&#8208;Ag dual sites spatially separates C&#8211;C coupling and intermediate protonation, making *CO dimerization thermodynamically more favorable than *CO hydrogenation. In situ characterization and DFT calculations reveal that the Cl enables the Ti sites within the Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag configuration act as active center for CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling, thereby increasing the *CO intermediate concentration and lowering the C&#8211;C coupling energy barrier. Concurrently, Ag sites preferentially catalyze H2O dissociation, providing active hydrogen for the subsequent protonation of *OCCO intermediates, thus increasing the overall C2H4 formation rate. The optimized Ti&#9472;Cl&#9472;Ag catalysts achieve high C2H4 production rate of 244 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 64.3% selectivity, outperforming O&#8208;bridged Ti&#8211;Ag catalysts which mainly favor *CO deep hydrogenation. This work establishes spatially separated Ti&#8211;Ag dual sites that orchestrates site&#8208;specific C&#8211;C coupling and active hydrogen feeding, providing a rational design concept of photocatalysts for selective reduction of CO2 to C2H4.

         <title>Orientation&#8208;Engineered Anderson&#8208;Type Polyoxometalate Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>

In this work, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs) with different ZnMo6O24H6 (ZnMo6) building block arrangements were successfully synthesized through cluster self&#8208;assembly strategy. Different building block site exposures altered the lithium storage activity and charge storge mechanism of Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs.








Abstract
The unique atomic&#8208;scale active site exposure of two&#8208;dimensional sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (2D SNSs) effectively shorten the electron/ion diffusion distance, significantly enhancing the rapid charge&#8211;discharge performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, it is still challenging to precisely regulate the exposed sites of the building blocks. Herein, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 sub&#8208;1&#160;nm nanosheets (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6 SNSs) were successfully synthesized through the cluster self&#8208;assembly strategy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed two stable configurations (Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 and Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;0.05) with distinct active sites exposure. Notably, Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 exhibited excellent performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, with a reversible capacity of 1361.9&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, significantly outperforming Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;0.05 (258.5&#160;mAh g&#8722;1). Electrochemical mechanism and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the terminal&#8208;oxygen (Ot) sites exposed in Zn&#8208;ZnMo6&#8208;1 enabled optimal lithium&#8208;ions adsorption (Eads&#160;=&#160;&#8722;6.54&#160;eV), which facilitated rapid lithium storage behavior and exhibited exceptional redox reversibility. This study would provide a promising novel approach for the design and synthesis of 2D SNSs at molecule level.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Iron (IV) Formation and the pH&#8208;Dependent Kinetics of the Fenton Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Research Article (e17261) by Kevin R. Wilson and co&#8208;workers, a new unified kinetic model is developed to describe the pH dependent kinetics of the Fenton reaction. By incorporating iron speciation and updated rate constants, the model reproduces experimental results and reveals that hydroxyl radicals dominate at low pH, while Fe(IV) becomes the main oxidant under near&#8208;neutral conditions.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Coacervates Through Controlled Self&#8208;Immolative Demembranization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiation&#8208;responsive coacervates constructed by self&#8208;immolative polymer (SIP) membranes achieve controlled demembranation upon radiation. These SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates possess anti&#8208;fusion capabilities, with their fusion properties activated in response to radiation. Through regulating the diffusion barrier of enzyme cascade reactions, enzyme kinetics can be regulated. As synthetic organelles in living cells, SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates can regulate nitric oxide production and enhance cancer cell cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Coacervates formed through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been utilized to emulate the dynamic organization of membraneless organelles in biological systems. These structures exhibit broad application prospects in biomedicine, especially as microreactors for biochemical reactions. However, membraneless coacervates tend to coalesce easily in ambient condition and lack the ability to achieve precise, stimulus&#8208;responsive release, which presents significant challenges for their biomedical applications. To address this, we developed a self&#8208;immolative polymer (SIP)&#8208;membranized coacervates to tune enzyme cascade kinetics using radiotherapeutic &#947;&#8208;ray. The SIP&#8208;membranized coacervates exhibited enhanced kinetic stability and fusion&#8208;resistance. When exposed to radiation, the SIP membrane undergoes depolymerization, resulting in increased fluidity and enhanced transmembrane transport. This, in turn, regulated enzyme cascade reactions within the coacervates. Specifically, we used radiation&#8208;responsive coacervates to precisely modulate the generation of NO in living cells and exploited NO&#8208;mediated radiosensitization to enhance cytotoxicity. Our findings advance the development of radiation&#8208;responsive LLPS constructs, and pave the way for innovative applications in cellular bioengineering, and combined radio&#8208;chemotherapy.

         <dc:description>
A single propargylic alcohol beam enters a catalyst prism and splits into three product beams via adaptive rhodium catalysis assisted by a Lewis&#8208;acidic secondary sphere. In their Communication (e202515903), Christophe Werl&#233; and co&#8208;workers describe a rhodium catalyst featuring a triazine ligand with a borane arm that selectively transforms a propargylic alcohol into retained alkynes, allylic ethers, or (E)&#8208;alkenes.

         <title>Homologative 1,3&#8208;Functionalization of Alkenes via an Iodomethyl Thianthrenium Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to access 1,3&#8208;functionalized patterns from alkenes remain limited. Recently, Silvi and co&#8208;workers reported a strategy to add the methyl thianthrenium radical across alkenes to rapidly produce 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles. The 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles can be diversified through sequential nucleophilic substitution reactions, delivering a wide array of 1,3&#8208;functionalized products.








Abstract
Despite tremendous progress in alkene 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, analogous methods to generate 1,3&#8208;patterns from alkenes remain limited. Recently, Silvi and co&#8208;workers reported a homologative strategy to transform alkenes into 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70005). They introduce a novel iodomethyl thianthrenium salt as a precursor to methyl thianthrenium radical, which adds across unactivated alkenes. Substitution of the 1,3&#8208;dielectrophiles delivers a general homologative alkene difunctionalization platform.

In the Research Article by Anjana Devi and co&#8208;workers (e202513066) a new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex is introduced as a thermally stable atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. It features a rare mononuclear structure, suitable volatility, and a low melting point of 55 &#176;C. ALD trials yielded lithium silicate films. This study opens new directions for NHC&#8208;ligand chemistry in thin&#8208;film deposition applications.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;grafted hydrophobic polymer brushes play a critical role in surface modification. Hydrophobic polymer brushes are facilely but efficiently fabricated in pure aqueous phase with phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered water&#8208;immiscible monomers using methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the transport carrier. The method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers in an environment and user&#8208; and user&#8208;friendly manner. The resulting polymer brushes show great potential in information encoding and low&#8208;friction lubrication, as reported by Wei Li in their Research Article (e202516468).

An energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical platform enables dual&#8208;side formate production by pairing CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR), replacing the energy&#8208;intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With an optimized Cu3Ag7&#8208;based FOR anode and a BiOCl&#8208;based CO2RR cathode, the cell operates at just 0.5 V&#8208;1.5 V lower than the conventional OER||CO2RR setup, delivering markedly higher energy efficiency and productivity (e202516232)

A crown and two macrocyclic compounds, consisting of BODIPY subunits, lie beside the treasure chest and gold coins. In their Communication (e202519612), the groups of Takano and Shinokubo provide a highly strained macrocyclic BODIPY trimer, [3]cycloBODIPY, through a multinuclear gold complex. [3]cycloBODIPY displays photochemical and electrochemical properties stemming from the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation and the deformation of BODIPY subunits.

         <title>Engineering Autonomous Micro&#8208;/Nanorobots for Neurological Diseases: From Barrier Crossing to Neuroenergetic Restoration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores the potential of micro&#8208;/nanorobots in treating neurological diseases, focusing on blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration, stem cell regulation, and energy metabolism modulation. These advancements shift treatment toward more precise, targeted therapies, with intelligent technologies offering promising prospects for revolutionizing care.








Abstract
Neurological diseases (NDs) are associated with barrier transport dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation, and impaired cellular energy metabolism, with bioenergetic deficits increasingly recognized as a central factor in disease progression. Micro&#8208;/nanorobots offer a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling active and targeted regulation of neuronal metabolism. Unlike passive nanocarriers, micro&#8208;/nanorobots can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) under external guidance and deliver therapeutic agents with subcellular precision. By integrating mitochondrial&#8208;targeting components, ATP&#8208;generating modules, and redox&#8208; or ion&#8208;responsive release systems, they can restore cellular energy supply and attenuate oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic function, synaptic activity, and neural repair. This minireview summarizes recent advances in micro&#8208;/nanorobot applications for drug delivery, barrier penetration, stem&#8208;cell differentiation, and metabolic regulation. It explores their potential roles in improving neuronal function, limiting pathological protein aggregation, and facilitating neural network reconstruction. Also, clinical translation faces significant challenges, including safety evaluation, large&#8208;scale manufacturing, and regulatory compliance. A therapeutic framework centered on micro&#8208;/nanorobot&#8208;mediated metabolic regulation may provide a novel and effective approach for treating NDs.

         <title>Photochemical Di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Methane Rearrangement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent advances in photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement and its heteroatom variants (ODPM, ADPM), showcasing their evolution from UV&#8208;driven curiosities to versatile visible&#8208;light photocatalyzed reactions for synthesizing complex strained architectures through energy transfer mechanisms, enabling efficient synthesis of complex natural products and functional materials.








Abstract
Photochemical di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (DPM) rearrangement, a classic transformation pioneered by Zimmerman, elegantly converts 1,4&#8208;dienes and related systems into complex, strain&#8208;rich vinylcyclopropane architectures. For decades, its utility in organic synthesis was constrained by its reliance on direct UV irradiation, which limited functional group tolerance and practical application. However, the recent integration of this elegant photochemical rearrangement with the principles of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer catalysis has sparked a dramatic renaissance. This review chronicles the journey of the DPM rearrangement from its foundational mechanistic principles to its modern catalytic incarnation. We detail the expansion of the reaction family&#8212;encompassing oxa&#8208; (ODPM) and aza&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ADPM) variants&#8212;and highlight its evolving applications in the total synthesis of natural products and beyond. Finally, we offer a perspective on future opportunities, underscoring how this venerable reaction continues to enable synthetic innovation and discovery in the 21st century.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells: From Failure Mechanisms to Practical Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines key failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, including short circuits caused by zinc dendrite, high polarization due to by&#8208;product accumulation, and swelling from H2 evolution. It highlights practical solutions such as anode protective layers, separator optimizations, and electrolyte designs (e.g., hydrogels, high&#8208;entropy, co&#8208;solvents, additives). Future directions for commercialization are also discussed.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been regarded as promising candidates for stationary energy storage owing to their low cost, inherent safety, and high volumetric energy density. To fully leverage these advantages in practical applications, the pouch cell configuration offers a favorable design with compactness and lightweight packaging. Nonetheless, commercial viability remains limited by inadequate cycling stability in pouch cells, despite the extended cycle life achieved in coin cells. In this review, we emphasize the performance gap between materials&#8208;level coin cells and device&#8208;level pouch cells and elucidate the failure mechanisms in pouch&#8208;type zinc&#8208;ion batteries. These mechanisms include internal short&#8208;circuits caused by severe zinc dendrite growth under high area capacity conditions, and high polarization resulting from by&#8208;product accumulation and hydrogen evolution due to water&#8208;induced corrosion. We then comprehensively review recent progress in zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells, highlighting strategies such as artificial protective layers on the Zn anode, separator modifications, and electrolyte design. Finally, we propose a future research direction to advance and commercialize zinc&#8208;ion battery technology.

Why should we divide noncovalent interactions into dozens of ambiguous bond types when it is completely unnecessary to do so?








Abstract
In a recent Scientific Perspective, Pizzi et&#160;al. recommend that &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole bonds should be named after the Periodic&#8208;Table group to which the electrophile belongs or, if greater specificity is required, after the element type of the electrophile. This could easily give rise to dozens of noncovalent bond types. The stated benefits of this naming scheme are of debatable value. In addition, it conceals the strong underlying similarity of the differently named interactions. The obvious alternative is to use the terms that reflect the physical natures of these interactions: &#963;&#8208;hole bond, &#960;&#8208;hole bond and, possibly, p&#8208;hole bond. The concerns that Pizzi et&#160;al. have about these terms are shown here to be unjustified, largely because they are based on irrelevant hypothetical interactions. The benefits of using &#963;&#8208;, &#960;&#8208; and p&#8208;hole bonds instead of dozens of individual names are simplicity, greater clarity and a lack of ambiguity.

         <title>Hybrid of Indolizine and Merocyanine&#8212;A New Class of Organelle&#8208;Specific Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new merocyanines and cyanines possessing an indolizine scaffold were synthesized via tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, by leveraging the special reactivity of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. Indolizine scaffold as a donor enables the bathochromic shift of emission independent of solvent polarity, whereas indolizine&#8211;cyanine selectively marks mitochondria or RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli. 








Abstract
Unlocking the potential of electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;hydroxyindolizines led to the discovery of a new class of dyes&#8212;indolizine&#8208;merocyanines (IndMer) and indolizine&#8208;cyanines. Tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution afforded structurally diverse dyes, as both the nucleophilic and electrophilic partners can be broadly modified. A convergent fragment coupling strategy allowed rapid access to these &#960;&#8208;conjugated merocyanines in three steps from pyridines. Uniform distribution of the HOMO and LUMO combined with negligible change of dipole moment upon excitation is responsible for the intense orange or red emission of this new family of reasonably photostable dyes in a broad range of solvents. The new merocyanine dyes have the potential to target a variety of organelles&#8212;both uncharged and positively charged indolizine&#8211;merocyanines localize a subset of cellular lysosomes, positively charged indolizine&#8211;cyanine hybrid accumulates in mitochondria, while coumarin&#8211;merocyanine shows context&#8208;dependent localization to mitochondria and RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli of the living cells.

         <title>Redox Noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Enabling Electron Transfer Catalysis</title>

The redox noninnocence of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has been evaluated for indole alkoxycarboxylation reactions, where the electron&#8208;rich ligand backbone steers the electron transfer reactions.








Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is an iconic class of ligand that spans a wide variety of metal complexes across the periodic table. Compared to the well&#8208;evaluated redox noninnocent nature of several other ligand classes, detectable redox activity for &#946;&#8208;diketiminate is scarce. The development of an effective homogeneous catalyst leveraging the redox reservoir property of a &#946;&#8208;diketiminate backbone has never been achieved. Herein, we present a copper bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) complex that enables the completely ligand&#8208;centric redox for steering alkoxycarboxylation at the 2&#8208;position of indole. The success of the reaction pivots on the electron reservoir property of an electron&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;diketiminate that can facilitate single electron transfer to reductively cleave a C&#9472;Br bond. X&#8208;ray structure determination of the complex, along with CV, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility, describes the electronic structure of the catalyst molecule and proves the ligand's predominant role in such single&#8208;electron transfer catalysis.

         <title>Photochargeable Nanopores in Gas Permselective Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework, a photochargeable CO2 permselective mixed&#8208;matrix membrane is realized. Photocharging leads to enhanced CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity.








Abstract
Gas permselective membranes are inherently constrained by a trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity. Overcoming this limitation is key to enabling broader industrial adoption, and advanced porous materials&#8212;particularly metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8212;has emerged as promising candidate. Yet, to truly rival established separation technologies such as, distillation, pressure swing adsorption and chemisorption, innovative design strategies remain essential. Traditionally, efforts to surpass the trade&#8208;off have focused on regulating porosity, pore architecture, pore surface chemical functionality, and macroscopic transport pathways (particle morphology). These modifications are achieved either through bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches or by employing external stimuli such as light, pressure, or electric fields. In this work, we introduce a photochargeable membrane that enhances gas permselectivity through precise, molecule&#8208;specific interactions&#8212;without altering the underlying porous architecture. This is achieved by incorporating a nanoporous MOF, constructed from redox&#8208;active organic ligands, as filler in a mixed matrix membrane. Upon photoexcitation, ligand&#8211;ligand charge separation yields stable pore surface charges, facilitating selective interactions with quadrupolar CO2. This specific interaction enhances CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 permselectivity, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept can be explored for mixed and high purity gas feed preparation.

         <title>Quantum Interference Effect in Saturated Systems: Effect of Anchoring Group Position on Conductance of Bipiperidines and their in&#8208;situ Derived Dithiocarbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates distinct quantum interference effect in saturated systems as compared to their unsaturated counterparts and the origin of multiple conductance features observed in single molecule conductance experiments of different isomers of bipiperdine and their in&#8208;situ generated dithiocarbamates.








Abstract
This study investigates quantum interference in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems, focusing on the impact of anchoring group nature and its position. Using a combined approach of mechanically controlled break junction experiments and quantum transport calculations, we demonstrate that meta&#8208;connected &#963;&#8208;conducting bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular junctions exhibit higher conductance than para&#8208;connected ones. This trend is opposite to that of the trend typically observed in &#960;&#8208;molecular systems, indicating the existence of distinctly different quantum interference phenomenon in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems. Further, we show that anchoring group modifications achieved through in&#8208;situ dithiocarbamylation significantly alters the conductance and decay factors. We also elucidate the mechanism behind multiple conductance features observed in aliphatic bipiperidines with cyclic secondary amine and dithiocarbamate anchoring groups. This work demonstrates &#963;&#8208;quantum interference in bipiperidine&#8208;based molecular systems and highlights how changes in junction configuration, nature of the anchoring group and its position can be used to control conductance in &#963;&#8208;only molecular systems.

         <title>Anhydride&#8208;form Cellulose Derivatives: Synthesis, in Situ Reactive Separation, and Solvent Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the differential reactivity of acyl chlorides and anhydrides, we introduce anhydrides into the cellulose backbone. Ammonolysis of the anhydrides enables an in situ reactive separation without external precipitants within the cellulose solvents. Cellulose derivatives can be processed into films and fiber materials through aqueous solution, with an anhydride form offering a variety of reactive designs.








Abstract
The utilization of cellulose remains underexploited due to the use of toxic solvents, high energy consumption, difficulty in separation, and environmental concerns during dissolution, processing, and separation processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride cellulose (PAC), the first reported anhydride&#8208;form cellulose derivative, and in situ reactive separation of the cellulose derivatives by introducing ammonia gas. PAC is synthesized by a catalyst&#8208;free esterification reaction between cellulose and trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC). Excess ammonia is then added to convert the anhydride into a water&#8208;soluble amide&#8208;ammonium salt, resulting in the complete precipitation of all reactants from the homogeneous organic phase, thus achieving in situ reactive separation without external precipitants and producing phthalamide acid cellulose (PAAC). A simple solid&#8208;liquid separation allows for a solvent recovery efficiency of 90%. PAAC can dissolve in water and be processed into film and fiber materials, avoiding safety issues related to toxic or organic solvent processing. After processing, PAAC can be converted into phthalimide cellulose (PIC) or PAC by thermal treatment. PIC is a water&#8208;insoluble imide&#8208;form derivative with excellent resistance to organic solvents, acids, and heat, while PAC serves as a multi&#8208;functional platform for carrying out various functional reactions of anhydrides on demand.

         <title>Quantifying the Biodegradation of Water&#8208;Soluble Polymer Mixtures with Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fate of polymers in liquid formulations in natural environments has not been extensively researched, in part as a result of incompatible analytical techniques. We show that diffusion NMR spectroscopy can be used to quantify the simultaneous biodegradation of multiple water&#8208;soluble polymers with limited sample preparation, measuring the molar mass, and chemical composition of multiple species with no molar mass restriction.








Abstract
Polymers in liquid formulations result in 36 million tons of waste each year. It is estimated that 13% of these polymers directly enter, and accumulate in, natural environments, however, their fate is poorly understood; in part as a consequence of challenges in characterizing how the polymers biodegrade. Multiple analytical techniques have been used to quantify polymer biodegradation but require extensive sample preparation and can only measure one species accurately at a time, inhibiting the measurement of water&#8208;soluble polymer mixtures. Here, we report the application of diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an alternative method to enable the facile monitoring of polymer biodegradation. This technique uniquely aids the understanding of biodegradation mechanisms, by measuring chemical as well as molar mass changes, concurrently, for both the polymer and degradation products. Furthermore, the ability to detect and measure the molar mass of multiple separate species enables the measurement of simultaneous biodegradation of polymer mixtures, including polymers with different chemical structures but the same molar mass.

&lt;p&gt;Polymers in liquid formulations result in 36 million tons of waste each year. It is estimated that 13% of these polymers directly enter, and accumulate in, natural environments, however, their fate is poorly understood; in part as a consequence of challenges in characterizing how the polymers biodegrade. Multiple analytical techniques have been used to quantify polymer biodegradation but require extensive sample preparation and can only measure one species accurately at a time, inhibiting the measurement of water-soluble polymer mixtures. Here, we report the application of diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an alternative method to enable the facile monitoring of polymer biodegradation. This technique uniquely aids the understanding of biodegradation mechanisms, by measuring chemical as well as molar mass changes, concurrently, for both the polymer and degradation products. Furthermore, the ability to detect and measure the molar mass of multiple separate species enables the measurement of simultaneous biodegradation of polymer mixtures, including polymers with different chemical structures but the same molar mass.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of the Acid Reactivity of Carbenium Ions in Zeolites on the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we studied the Br&#248;nsted acid reactivity of polymethylbenzenium and alkyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentenyl cations, key intermediates in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins process in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. CD3CN selectively and reversibly deprotonates benzenium ions, while cyclopentenyl cations require stronger bases. These results reveal a reactivity scale and provide insight into carbocation chemistry in reactive environments.








Abstract
Carbocations are typical intermediates in acid catalyzed reactions in organic chemistry synthesis. Confinement within the framework of zeotype materials distinguishes the function of carbenium ions as catalytic centers in various chemical processes. A selective and reversible deprotonation event of benzenium ions built in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 during methanol conversion was observed by experiment and theory as a result of CD3CN dosage, denoting their higher acid reactivity compared to the cyclopentenyl cations, which undergo deprotonation only in presence of pyridine. This study uncovers the inverse relationship between the acid reactivity of carbenium ions of different nature and their stability in the surface&#8208;bound state.

A desymmetrization strategy for an enantioselective Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling to access highly enantioenriched, axially chiral biaryl boronic esters is disclosed. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct.








Abstract
An efficient protocol for a desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl bis(nonaflates) and B&#8211;B reagents is disclosed. An in situ&#8208;formed palladium(0)&#8211;(S,S)&#8208;f&#8208;Binaphane complex discriminates between the enantiotopic nonaflate groups, and the subsequent transmetalation of the B&#8211;B reagent is enhanced by a copper co&#8208;catalyst. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct. This enantioselective Miyaura reaction enables the synthesis of highly valuable, axially chiral boron compounds with superb enantiomeric ratios (up to e.r.&#160;= 99:1) and exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Failure Mechanism of High&#8208;Temperature Li&#8211;S Batteries in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insufficient Li2S dissociation and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be dominant factors for the rapid performance deterioration of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in r&#8208;LHCE. To this end, B&#8208;LMCE featured by suitable anion concentration and weak solvation ability is developed, which concurrently alleviates electrolyte consumption, restricts polysulfide shuttling, and enables kinetically favorable sulfur redox reaction at elevated temperatures with a tailored electrochemical voltage range.








Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes struggle to sustain steady operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries at high temperatures due to inferior thermal durability and aggravated parasitic reactions. Although localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance thermal stability, its deployment in high&#8208;temperature (HT) Li&#8211;S batteries has met with limited success. Herein, the failure mechanism of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in LHCE is revealed via probing sulfur redox reactions and electrolyte solvation chemistry. Slow reaction kinetics and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be the dominant factors causing the rapid capacity deterioration at high temperatures. To this end, a diethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based localized medium concentration electrolyte (B&#8208;LMCE) with suitable anion concentration and weakly solvating effect is developed. The new electrolyte concurrently achieves fast cathode kinetics and stable anode/electrolyte interface. With the assistance of a tailored electrochemical voltage range of 1&#8211;3.8&#160;V, Li&#8211;S batteries sustain a durable cycling performance over 250 cycles at 60 &#176;C. They also showcase superior wide&#8208;temperature operation (0&#160;&#176;C&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C) while enabling feasible fabrication of Ah&#8208;level pouch cells. Our study opens a new avenue for designing extreme&#8208;temperature electrolytes toward pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cis/Trans Isomerization of a Metal Centre Involving a Metal&#8208;Organic Halogen&#8208;Bonded (MOXB) Cocrystal</title>

         <dc:description>
The presented work demonstrates a cocrystallization&#8208;enabled mechanochemical interconversion of geometrical isomers of a coordination complex, illustrating the use of halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven cocrystal formation for generating new metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours.








Abstract
Halogen bonding enables the mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling isomerization of an otherwise persistent cis&#8208;coordinated metal complex into the corresponding trans&#8208;isomer. The importance of halogen bonding for enabling the cis&#8594;trans isomerization of the metal centre is evidenced by real&#8208;time in situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction monitoring of the ball&#8208;milling experiments that showed the transient appearance of a cis&#8208;geometry metal&#8208;organic halogen&#8208;bonded (MOXB) cocrystal, which is rapidly replaced by the corresponding trans&#8208;geometry one, with any excess, non&#8208;halogen&#8208;bonded cis&#8208;geometry complex being retained throughout the milling experiment. The importance of cocrystallization for cis&#8594;trans isomerization is supported by periodic density&#8208;functional theory calculations which show that the process becomes notably more enthalpically favourable in the presence of the halogen bond donor. The presented work indicates that the formation of MOXB cocrystals can open the door to new, metal&#8208;based responsive behaviours, different from those of parent solid&#8208;state coordination complexes.

A rare silicon(IV)&#8208;based azo compound featuring a Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkage was synthesized via the direct reaction of an organoazide with a silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor. This compound undergoes an unusual CO activation process, resulting in N2 release and complete cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond, forming a Si(II)/Si(IV) product bridged by an oxygen atom and an organic isonitrile.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;substituted azo compounds featuring Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkages remain elusive in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a silicon&#8208;based azo compound generated directly from a mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor and a bulky organic azide. Unlike classical iminosilane formation, this reaction affords a thermally stable Si(IV)&#8211;azo species. Upon treatment with carbon monoxide (CO), this compound undergoes N2 extrusion, complete C&#8801;O bond cleavage, and formation of a formal Si(II)/Si(IV) product in which an oxygen atom bridges both silicon centers. Notably, the transformation incorporates the carbon atom into a DippNC byproduct via ligand rearrangement. A similar transformation occurs upon reaction with Fe(CO)5, wherein N2 release and CO cleavage also occur, but with the resulting Fe(CO)4 fragment coordinating to the silicon center. These results demonstrate a rare example of silicon based azo&#8208;mediated small&#8208;molecule activation and highlight the potential of silicon&#8208;based systems for multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry typically associated with transition metals.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) Using a Super&#8208;Reducing Photoredox Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;reducing organic photocatalyst expands the scope of O&#8208;ATRP to challenging initiators and monomers. The system enables controlled polymerizations with air tolerance, temporal regulation, and grafting&#8208;from strategies, highlighting the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs in reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.








Abstract
The development of highly reducing photoredox catalysts (PCs) has brought forth new approaches to activating strong chemical bonds for small molecule and polymer synthesis. Organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O&#8208;ATRP) is a polymerization methodology that uses organic PCs for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers proceeding through a reversible&#8208;deactivation mechanism. However, the reaction scope of O&#8208;ATRP is confined to initiators and dormant polymer states that can be reduced by a PC. Herein, we report an O&#8208;ATRP system using a super&#8208;reducing PC to expand the capability of O&#8208;ATRP to monomers (such as styrene (St) and vinylcarbazole (VCz)) and initiators (including aromatic halides and pseudo&#8208;halides) that are challenging with most O&#8208;ATRP systems. This system provides control over polymerization, air tolerance, and temporal regulation and enables the synthesis of polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting&#8208;from reactions on linear chains. This strategy builds upon the transformative potential of super&#8208;reducing PCs toward advancing the field of reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization.

A &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent can synergistically target amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology and innate immunity, achieving a heightened efficacy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapeutics.








Abstract
Recent progress in antibody&#8208;based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical benefits, and pro&#8208;inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA) that synergistically targets amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA actively migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed &#946;&#8208;secretase, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from A&#946; antigen&#8208;specific Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage A&#946; and inflammatory microglia, thereby synergistically eradicating A&#946; and reducing pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. In AD mouse models, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust A&#946; removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings highlight ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA as next&#8208;generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the limitations of conventional antibody&#8208;based treatments for AD.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Channel Gas&#8208;Sensitive Fluorescent Switch: Realizing a Reversible Fluorescent Response to HCl and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the first metal&#8211;organic frameworks integrating molecular conformation locking and coordination&#8208;induced energy transfer mechanism for fluorescent sensing of harmful gases were rationally designed and constructed. Ln&#8208;TCPE achieves a reversible fluorescent response to HCl gas through the dual channels while Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves a reversible fluorescent response to NH3 gas through the single channel. This study provides more detailed and deeper mechanistic insights into the fluorescent gas responsive process.








Abstract
Luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) provide exceptional advantages over conventional materials in detecting harmful gases. However, challenges remain, such as limited stability, unclear fluorescence signal changes and insufficient mechanistic understanding. In this study, we developed two types of lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting rapid (&lt;5&#160;s) and reversible fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses to vapor exposure. Specifically, Ln&#8208;TCPE demonstrates a swift response to HCl vapor via a unique dual&#8208;channel mechanism: highly dipolar HCl molecules stabilize the conformation of tetraphenylethylene ligands through weak intermolecular interactions, causing a 780% increase in fluorescence intensity. Simultaneously, HCl coordination with Ln3+ triggers a pronounced 45&#160;nm redshift in fluorescence by altering the MOFs' overall energy and electron transfer dynamics. The combination of these two signals greatly amplifies the fluorescence transition. Outstanding stability allows the sample's initial fluorescence to be fully restored through simple thermal desorption, enabling recyclability. With fewer open metal sites, Ln&#8208;ETTB achieves fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; detection of NH3 vapor solely via benzene ring locking, and it can likewise be recycled. This study presents the first report of such dual&#8208;channel gas&#8208;responsive LMOFs. We thoroughly elucidated the underlying mechanisms through experimental work and DFT calculations, paving the way for new advancements in LMOFs&#8208;based gas sensing.

         <title>Synergic Coordination Effect in Nonflammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel sodium&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte, which is induced to form by the double synergistic action of Na&#9472;O and hydrogen bonding together, and the unique solvated structure significantly enhances the compatibility at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which leads to the excellent performance of the sodium&#8208;ion batteries. 








Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are emerging as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation electrolytes, poised to revolutionize the performance of safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, a significant challenge hindering the progress of SIBs is the scarcity of suitable DEEs capable of harmonizing electrolyte conductivity, interfacial compatibility, and safety. In this study, we have engineered a DEE leveraging the synergistic interplay between Na&#8208;bonds and hydrogen bonds, achieved through the integration of N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA) and sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). The findings reveal that the distinctive interaction between the polar C&#9552;O group in NMA and Na+ ions, coupled with hydrogen bonding with DFOB&#8722; anions, facilitates the formation of the DEE. The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na+/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance.

     alt="Synergic Coordination Effect in Nonflammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report a novel sodium-based deep eutectic electrolyte, which is induced to form by the double synergistic action of Na&#9472;O and hydrogen bonding together, and the unique solvated structure significantly enhances the compatibility at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which leads to the excellent performance of the sodium-ion batteries. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are emerging as a highly promising class of next-generation electrolytes, poised to revolutionize the performance of safe sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, a significant challenge hindering the progress of SIBs is the scarcity of suitable DEEs capable of harmonizing electrolyte conductivity, interfacial compatibility, and safety. In this study, we have engineered a DEE leveraging the synergistic interplay between Na-bonds and hydrogen bonds, achieved through the integration of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylacetamide (NMA) and sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB). The findings reveal that the distinctive interaction between the polar C&#9552;O group in NMA and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, coupled with hydrogen bonding with DFOB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, facilitates the formation of the DEE. The designed DEE demonstrates exceptional ionic conductivity (4.03 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C), a high oxidation voltage (4.63&#160;V versus Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na), and nonflammability. The unique solvation structure markedly enhances the compatibility of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, with the NVP||Na cell exhibiting outstanding cycling performance (86.8% retention after 7000 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability. Moreover, the DEEs exhibit robust performance at elevated temperatures (94.3% retention after 120 cycles with NVP||Na cell), and the full cell demonstrates significant enhancements in both cycle stability (90.7% retention after 300 cycles) and rate performance. The incorporation of amide-based eutectic electrolytes into SIBs infuses fresh vitality into electrolyte design, propelling the advancement of high-performance SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prediction of One&#8208;Dimensional Metallicity and &#960;&#8208;Band Superconductivity in Rhodizonate Radical Pancakes</title>

         <dc:description>
Equidistant stacking of radicals is typically unstable due to symmetry&#8208;lowering distortions. We predict that such arrangements can be stabilized by multicentered covalent (&#8220;pancake&#8221;) bonding and Coulombic repulsion between negatively charged radicals. This leads to design principles for a new class of organic conductors&#8212;potentially superconductors&#8212;based on abundant, environmentally benign elements. 








Abstract
Computational exploration of condensed phases made of potassium and carbon monoxide leads to predictions of stable salts composed of cyclic six&#8208;membered oxocarbon anions and K+ cations, Kn(C6O6)m. The states of reduction in these systems are wide&#8208;ranging, with C6O6 molecules formally reduced by &#8722;2, &#8722;3, &#8722;3.5, and &#8722;6 in semiconducting and metallic phases. Special attention is paid to K3C6O6, in which triply charged radical anions stack closely and equidistantly in one dimension. Equidistant interactions of radicals are exceedingly rare and typically unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, Peierls or Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The predicted exception of K3C6O6 is explained by inter&#8208;ring multicenter bonding, also known as pancake bonding, in combination with large ionic repulsion. This fascinating interplay of interactions facilitates an exceptionally high density of states at the Fermi level and leads us to predictions of metallicity, a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity, and rare &#960;&#8208;band superconductivity. These predictions reinvigorate the search for new organic conductors and superconductors using molecular design of metallic salts.

         <title>Polycyclic Heteroaromatics with Planar&#8208;Curved Hybrid Skeletons for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One kind of polycyclic heteroaromatics with the unique planar&#8208;negatively curved hybrid skeletons was constructed through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of NBN&#8208;embedded dibenzophenalene. Their photophysical properties, electrochemical behaviors, and hydrogen bond interactions can be significantly improved through tuning their curvatures. Upon visible&#8208;light stimulation, they enable high&#8208;performance photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Creating curvature in the scaffolds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enables breaking their molecular planarity or even symmetry, leading to some exceptional optoelectronic activities and assembling behaviors, but rarely explored for promoting photoredox catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of two PAHs through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of a dibenzophenalene precursor edged with a pristine zigzag nitrogen (N)&#8211;boron (B)&#8211;nitrogen (N) unit. Their unique planar&#8208;negatively curved molecular skeletons were revealed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. Fusing another benzene ring at the terminal positions of such kinds of PAH molecules resulted in a more contorted structure, which led to the successive reversible electrochemical behaviors, stronger hydrophilicity, and better photogenerated charge generation and separation as evidenced by experimental and theoretical data. Upon visible&#8208;light activation, the as&#8208;prepared PAHs showed a curvature&#8208;strengthened photocatalytic activity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (yield: up to 6696&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) with good recyclability and reusability. Finally, the femtosecond transient absorption spectra (fs&#8208;TAS) indicate that the more curved structure Nap&#8208;NBN&#8208;PAH has more photogenerated charges and a longer excited state lifetime, which is consistent with better photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Simultaneous Measurement of RNA Synthesis and Degradation Rates in Single Cells Unveils the Regulatory Mechanisms of Temporal RNA Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double metabolic RNA labeling&#8208;based single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method (scDUAL&#8208;seq) was developed to measure RNA synthesis and degradation rates simultaneously in single cells. scDUAL&#8208;seq resolves the cell cycle&#8208;dependent variations of RNA kinetic rates in cortisol response, identifies the underlying regulatory strategies, and elucidates the coordinated regulation of RNA kinetic rates that control distinct strategy transitions.








Abstract
The temporal dynamics of coordinated RNA transcription and degradation are heterogeneous among different cell types or states. However, current transcriptomic approaches are unable to simultaneously measure transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA synthesis and degradation rates in single cells for resolving the RNA regulatory mechanisms during dynamic processes. Herein, we develop scDUAL&#8208;seq, which integrates double nucleoside analogs pulse&#8208;pulse labeling, chemical nucleoside conversion, and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing to record both RNA transcription and RNA degradation in heterogeneous cell populations. Compared to single nucleoside analog labeling&#8208;based methods, scDUAL&#8208;seq allows simultaneous recording of RNA transcription and degradation, leading to more accurate determination of RNA kinetic rates and RNA regulatory strategies. In a cortisol response model, scDUAL&#8208;seq enables the discovery of key regulons driving strategy transitions and elucidation of the coordinated regulation of RNA synthesis and degradation rates that control distinct strategy transitions. scDUAL&#8208;seq is expected to provide new insights into RNA regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological processes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Conjugated Macrocyclic BODIPYs for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic substitution&#8208;cyclization&#8208;dehydrogenation reactions generate a photosensitizer exhibiting enhanced non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. 








Abstract
With this research we developed a cyclization strategy that effectively converts radiative transitions (RTs) to non&#8208;radiative transitions (NRTs) during the decay process of BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers. Compared to BODIPY monomers, cyclization leads to a significant decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and a significant increase in the HOMO energy. In particular, the absorption spectrum of 7a exhibits a significant redshift, with the maximum absorption wavelength reaching 794&#160;nm. Photophysical characterization indicates that the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d) exhibit a reduced RT process. While, the crystal structure and theoretical calculations suggest that the molecular ring distortion enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d). In addition 7a&#8208;NPs constructed using DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 encapsulation exhibit excellent water solubility, stability, and photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%). The photothermal therapeutic performance of 7a&#8208;NPs was evaluated through in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments. The results indicated that 7a&#8208;NPs could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near&#8208;infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali&#8208;induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo&#8208;thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.

The results indicated that &lt;b&gt;7a-NPs&lt;/b&gt; could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near-infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali-induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo-thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Modulation of Ion Clustering and Polymer Crystallinity for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;driven modulation effectively tailors ion clustering and polymer crystallinity, significantly enhancing low&#8208;temperature performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. A high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with diverse inorganic&#8208;rich SEI species demonstrates superior ionic conductivity, coulombic efficiency, and capacity retention at &#8722;20&#176;C compared to conventional electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries have garnered significant attention for their intrinsic safety and high energy density. Among various solid&#8208;state electrolytes, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer their excellent processability and interfacial compatibility but suffer from the formation of large ionic clusters and crystallization, which hinder Li+ transport and desolvation, particularly at low temperatures (e.g., deep&#8208;sea conditions). In this study, a multicomponent strategy is adopted to enhance the configurational entropy of SPEs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold reduction in Li cluster size and suppression of polymer crystallization. These changes facilitate rapid desolvation and promote the formation of a high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase. Owing to these benefits, the resulting SPEs exhibit an 8.5&#8208;fold improvement in ionic conductivity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (0.17 mS cm&#8722;1). The Li/Cu cells exhibit an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.59% over 300 cycles at room temperature, and maintain nearly unchanged CE even after a temperature drop to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the Li/LiFePO4 cells (N/P&#160;=&#160;4) achieve a 13&#8208;fold capacity improvement and an average capacity retention of 91.49% after 500 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C (over 248 days). This strategy builds a new approach for high performance SPEs for practical low&#8208;temperature operation.

Fused B&#8208;N coordinated organic NIR phosphors (TPP&#8208;BN/BF) with 819&#160;nm emission and 28.6&#160;ms lifetime are synthesized. PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG nanoengineering yields nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;folds enhanced afterglow. A GrB&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) leveraging peptide&#8211;PRET enables tumor immune monitoring with a 216.4 signal&#8208;background ratio, advancing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging, and programmable immunity assessments via molecular&#8208;to&#8208;nanoscale RTP design.








Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold great potential for bioimaging due to their ability to eliminate background noise and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we synthesized octa&#8208;ring fused RTP molecules (TPP&#8208;BN and TPP&#8208;BF) with B&#9472;N coordination bonds via a two&#8208;step reaction, enabling NIR phosphorescent emission at 819&#160;nm and a 28.6&#160;ms lifetime. Using PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG as host and surfactant to stabilize the RTP molecules, we fabricated PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG based nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;fold brighter afterglow than conventional F127&#8208;based methods (FNPs). We further developed a granzyme B (GrB)&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) that achieves specific and quantitative detection. In vivo studies demonstrated their ability to monitor and distinguish tumor immune response with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) as high as 216.4. This study provides a new method for constructing NIR organic RTP probes and advances applications of RTP materials in real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and tumor immune monitoring.

         <title>Studies of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Epoxyketone Synthesis by Small&#8208;Molecule Flavins and Flavoenzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
A combined synthetic and biochemical approach links the flavoenzyme EpxF to three key steps in epoxomicin biosynthesis. Crystallography, mutagenesis, and 13C&#8208;labeling complete the mechanistic picture of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone formation and illustrate the potential of flavin&#8208;mediated transformations.








Abstract
Epoxomicin is a highly potent natural proteasome inhibitor and the structural scaffold for the anticancer drug carfilzomib. The biosynthesis of its &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone warhead involves the flavoenzyme EpxF, but a molecular understanding of the key catalytic reaction cascade remained elusive. Here, we disclose detailed mechanistic insights by characterizing all intermediates in the sequential steps of decarboxylation, desaturation, and epoxidation with synthetic flavins and the flavin&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase EpxF. A high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of EpxF revealed the architecture of the active site and enabled the identification of key catalytic residues. Exploratory docking based on this structure served as a qualitative tool to guide mutagenesis and rationalize substrate recognition. NMR studies with a 13C&#8208;labeled epoxomicin precursor and structure&#8208;based EpxF variants further supported the proposed mechanism. Our integrated approach revealed similarities between synthetic and natural flavin catalysts and offers avenues for developing sustainable biomimetic reactions.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Resistant N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked TEMPO Catholytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of proton&#8208;resistant TEMPO catholytes were developed via N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and heterocycle grafting, enabling efficient charge redistribution and exceptional redox stability. The optimized DMA&#8208;TEMPO derivative delivers near&#8208;quantitative capacity retention (99.98% over 560 cycles), offering a robust molecular design strategy for durable AORFBs.








Abstract
TEMPO is a widely studied catholyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) but suffers from proton&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening degradation when its solubility is enhanced via hydrophilic substitution at the 4&#8208;position, leading to structural failure and rapid capacity fade. To address this issue, five TEMPO derivatives were synthesized through N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle grafting strategy. Combined analyses using atomic dipole moment&#8208;corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) charges, Fukui functions, and linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LTQ&#8208;XL) reveal that aromatic heterocycle functionalization enables favorable charge redistribution during redox cycling, enhancing both redox kinetics and molecular stability. In particular, dimethylaminopyridine&#8208;functionalized TEMPO (DMA&#8208;TEMPO) exhibits enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation and basicity, which suppresses proton&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and significantly improves structural resilience. 1&#160;M DMA&#8208;TEMPO catholyte delivers exceptional cycling performance, retaining 99.98% of its capacity after 560 cycles, while 2&#160;M system maintains 97% capacity over 100 cycles. Compared to its structural analog 1&#160;M PA&#8208;TEMPO, the cycle life is improved 18&#8208;fold. This study offers a robust molecular design strategy for developing proton&#8208;resistant catholytes, advancing the practical deployment of long&#8208;lasting AORFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Rare Mononuclear Lithium&#8211;Carbene Complex for Atomic Layer Deposition of Lithium Containing Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex is introduced as a thermally stable atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor. It features a rare mononuclear structure, suitable volatility, and a low melting point of 55&#160;&#176;C. ALD trials yielded lithium silicate films. This study opens new directions for NHC&#8208;ligand chemistry in thin&#8208;film deposition applications.








Abstract
Lithium is the core material of modern battery technologies and fabricating the lithium&#8208;containing materials with atomic layer deposition (ALD) confers significant benefits in control of film composition and thickness. In this work, a new mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized lithium complex, [Li(tBuNHC)(hmds)], is introduced as a promising precursor for ALD of lithium&#8208;containing thin films. Structural characterization is performed, comparing density functional theory (DFT) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), confirming a rare mononuclear structure. Favorable thermal properties for ALD applications are evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The compound exhibits a low melting point, clean evaporation, and its volatility parameters are encouraging compared to other lithium precursors. ALD trials using [Li(tBuNHC)(hmds)] with ozone demonstrate its effectiveness in depositing LiSixOy films. The ALD process exhibits a saturated growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.95&#160;&#197;. Compositional analysis&#160;using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry/nuclear reaction analysis (RBS/NRA), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD&#8208;OES), confirms the presence of lithium and silicon in the expected ratios. This work not only presents a new ALD precursor but also contributes to the understanding of lithium chemistry, offering insights into the intriguing coordination chemistry and thermal behavior of lithium complexes stabilized by NHC ligands.

         <title>Continuous Dual Hydrogenation of Biomass Substrates in a Membrane&#8208;Free Solid Electrolyte Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic dual hydrogenation method has been developed using hydrazine and cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, enhancing continuous biomass conversion to succinic acid with substantial hydrogenation Faraday efficiency (200%) and long durability (200&#160;h, 100&#160;mA) in a membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor. This advancement highlights significant potential for sustainable green chemistry applications.








Abstract
Production of chemicals from biomass through electrocatalytic hydrogenation shows great potential to reduce environmental impact across various applications in sustainable materials, medicine, food, and more. Particularly, dual electrocatalytic hydrogenation, leveraging concurrent reactions at both anode and cathode stand out with maximized electron efficiency (&#8764;200%) and production yield. However, at higher voltages, anodic hydrogen atoms (H*) tend to revert to protons. This tendency results in challenges such as low conversion rates and selectivity, and difficulties in maintaining continuous production. Herein, by employing hydrazine and water as the hydrogen sources for anode and cathode reactions, respectively, we achieved efficient dual hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid. This approach produces two H* atoms per electron transferred, promoting effective carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation at both cathode and anode. We further developed a modular, membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor for continuous dual hydrogenation of maleic acid using a commercial cobalt catalyst. By leveraging the hydrazine oxidation and water reduction, the reactor consistently produces succinic acid with a Faraday efficiency of approximately 180% for over 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA. Our approach shows significant potential for practical applications in green chemistry, particularly in efficient biomass conversion.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule DNA Tweezers Enable Programmable Control of Enzyme Activity via Arbitrary Molecular Cues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling enzyme activity with molecular precision remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a DNA&#8208;based strategy for the dynamic and programmable regulation of enzyme function in response to arbitrary, user&#8208;defined chemical cues. We report the development of single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs)&#8212;structures that can be programmed to bind and inhibit enzymes, then release upon sensing specific signals, restoring activity.








Abstract
Engineering allosteric control sites into enzymes typically requires extensive protein modification. Here, we introduce single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs), which enable programmable, allosteric&#8208;like regulation of enzyme activity in response to user&#8208;defined chemical cues, without altering the enzyme itself. SMDTs consist of two aptamers connected by a tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA linker. By binding non&#8208;covalently to two distinct sites on an enzyme, the SMDT adopts a &#8220;pinched&#8221; conformation, reminiscent of mechanical tweezers, that inhibits enzymatic activity. Upon exposure to specific molecular triggers, the SMDT undergoes a conformational change that releases the inhibitory aptamer, restoring function. The degree of inhibition and reactivation efficiency can be finely tuned by adjusting the DNA linker's length, sequence, flexibility, and geometry. Operating at nanomolar concentrations, the system exhibits high specificity, capable of discriminating between closely related inputs, including single&#8208;base mismatches in nucleic acids. Importantly, SMDTs can be programmed to respond not only to molecular abundance but also to molecular activity. We show the versatility of this platform by regulating enzymes using diverse triggers, including nucleic acids, transcription factors (TATA&#8208;binding protein [TBP], cellular myelocytomatosis [c&#8208;Myc]), signaling proteins (platelet&#8208;derived growth factor [PDGF]), small molecules (kanamycin), and metal ions (Mn2+). These results establish a generalizable framework for designing responsive protein binders that translate molecular recognition into functional outcomes.

         <title>Direct Boron&#8208;10 Access: Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B Coupling Utilizing 10BF3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C(sp2)&#9472;10B cross&#8208;coupling method was developed, utilizing commercially available 10BF3. This approach features a Lewis acid/base activation strategy to generate reactive borenium ions in situ. It enables the efficient synthesis of a wide range of 10B&#8208;enriched organoboron compounds, which hold significant potential for applications in boron neutron capture therapy drug development and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.








Abstract
The boron&#8208;10 isotope (10B) is critical for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); however, the direct use of industrially available 10BF3 for synthesizing 10B&#8208;enriched compounds remains challenging due to the strong B&#9472;F bonds. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol that enables direct C(sp2)&#9472;10B bond formation using 10BF3. This approach employs AlCl3 and a Lewis base to generate electrophilic borenium ions in situ. The method eliminates the need for pre&#8208;functionalized boron reagents, providing an efficient route to diverse 10B&#8208;enriched compounds with promising applications in BNCT and neutron&#8208;shielding materials.

The long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is finely localized by fluoride&#8208;mediated stabilization of lattice Co sites during reconstruction. The localized long&#8208;range disorder efficiently promotes Co&#9472;O covalency and induces tensile strain, leading to balanced activation and regeneration of lattice oxygen for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).








Abstract
Controlling the long&#8208;range disorder of dynamically reconstructed nanostructures represents a challenging but important approach for achieving practical catalysts with high performance. Here, we report a facile fluoride&#8208;mediated&#8208;stabilization strategy to finely localize the long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanosheets under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions with compatible lattice&#8208;oxygen activation and regeneration for robust anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE). The stabilized lattice Co by fluoride&#8208;induced bond reinforcing in pre&#8208;catalysts enabled localized long&#8208;range disorder of reconstructed amorphous oxyhydroxides. The localized long&#8208;range disorder can promote Co&#9472;O covalency for activating lattice oxygen and also induce tensile strain as an oxygen pump for regenerating lattice oxygen. The corresponding AEMWE yielded a cutting&#8208;edge current of 3.4 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V and remarkable stability with imperceptible degradation of 0.09&#160;mV h&#8722;1 in 1200&#160;h. This work opens up a feasible avenue for developing targeted catalysts under operating conditions by finely tuning the long&#8208;range disorder during reconstruction.

         <title>Topology Regulation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers for Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers. Thus, distinct topological arrangements lead to orders of magnitude differences in photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers, especially those with a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, are emerging as potent photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, even constructed with identical D&#8211;A building blocks, conjugated polymers with diverse topologies can yield distinct photocatalytic properties, underscoring the significance of topology regulation. Herein, two conjugated polymers, Bi&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A2 motif and Tri&#8208;CBTP with a D&#8208;A3 motif, were designed with identical building blocks, and synthesized via a low&#8208;energy, rapid sonochemical method to investigate the influence of topologies on photocatalytic hydrogen production. Comprehensive theoretical calculations and femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy reveal that the topology profoundly regulates the planarity, exciton binding energy, and electron push&#8211;pull effect of the D&#8211;A conjugated polymer. Specifically, Bi&#8208;CBTP achieves a rather high hydrogen production rate of 516.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 as the state&#8208;of&#8208;art performance under simulated solar irradiation, along with a 61.2% apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420&#160;nm. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production.

         <title>Programmable Charge Transport in a Multichannel Single&#8208;Molecule Parallel Circuit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular electronics is confronted with a fundamental challenge: balancing interfacial coupling strength. Strong coupling enhances mechanical stability but often reduces conductivity, whereas weak coupling favors high conductance yet compromises structural integrity. We solve this by integrating both strong and weak coupling modalities within a single&#8208;molecule architecture, achieving programmable ternary switching and memory with ON/OFF ratios &gt;102 and 950&#160;Hz frequency&#8212;setting a new performance benchmarkin molecular&#8208;scale electronic devices.








Abstract
Advances in molecular electronics focus on developing miniaturized electronic devices by leveraging molecules as fundamental building blocks. This approach exploits the unique structural properties of molecules and the robustness of their interfacial interactions with electrodes to achieve enhanced functionalities at the nanoscale. Achieving optimal balance between strong and weak interfacial couplings in molecular&#8208;scale devices to reconcile competing performance and stability requirements remains a significant scientific challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid coupling strategy utilizing multichannel parallel circuits to integrate the stability of strong coupling with the high&#8208;energy molecular orbitals of weak coupling. Through precise mechanical modulation of interfacial coupling, we demonstrate programmable ternary switching and storage devices, achieving On/Off ratios exceeding 102 and switching frequencies up to 950&#160;Hz via tip manipulation experiments. This investigation illuminates the complex dynamics of interfacial coupling in molecular devices and proposes a promising approach to optimize device stability and functionality by harmonizing strong and weak coupling in multichannel parallel circuits.

         <title>Tuning the Adsorption of H and OH on Ruthenium Aerogel to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Ru hetero&#8208;phases (fcc/hcp) combined with Cr ions doping effectively weakens the strong adsorption of OH and H species on Ru sites. This modulation of adsorption energetics exposes more active Ru centers, thereby significantly enhancing the alkaline HER activity of the Ru aerogel.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is an ideal alternative to platinum for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its exceptional catalytic performance. However, during the reaction, the excessively strong adsorption of proton (H) and hydroxyl (OH) species on Ru significantly limits its alkaline HER activity. Herein, we enhanced the alkaline HER performance of Ru by modulating its crystalline phase structure and incorporating a low dosage of Cr ions. The synthesized Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel exhibits a lower overpotential of only 14&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming Ru aerogels (Rufcc and Ruhcp) and commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, Cr0.033Ru0.967 fcc/hcp aerogel demonstrates a remarkable stability at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, sustaining continuous operation for 800&#160;h. Experimental results, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the heterogeneous phase interfaces in the CrRufcc/hcp aerogel effectively weaken the strong adsorption of H at Ru sites. Additionally, with their high affinity for OH species, Cr ions facilitate the removal of OH from adjacent Ru sites. Furthermore, Cr ion incorporation modifies the local electronic structure of Ru, further reducing its OH adsorption energy. This work highlights a synergistic approach to improving catalytic performance and offers a novel strategy for designing highly efficient and durable alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>Interrupting the Hydroxide Enrichment&#8208;Induced Electrode Degradation Loop for Achieving Stable Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper utilizes an electrolyte additive to dynamically interrupt the OH&#8722; crossover&#8208;induced electrode degradation and polyiodide formation. Moreover, it builds water&#8208;deficient electric double layers (EDLs) and forms a ZnS&#8208;rich hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), constrains OH&#8722;, and captures polyiodides at the cathode to simultaneously boost the aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery.








Abstract
Severe adverse reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, lead to short lifetimes of rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries and have aroused widespread attention. However, few studies have specifically investigated the impact of hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) disturbance generated by side reactions on the Zn anode and I2 cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a facile electrolyte additive strategy was introduced to break the OH&#8722; enrichment&#8208;induced bidirectional electrode degradation loop toward achieving stable Zn&#8208;I2 cells. Particularly, the bidirectional additive restricts the crossover of OH&#8722;, suppressing the iodine hydrolysis reaction&#8208;induced polyiodide formation and capturing polyiodides to prevent shuttling. It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn&#8208;I2 cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&#8722;2. The concept of bi&#8208;directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe adverse reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, lead to short lifetimes of rechargeable aqueous zinc-iodine (Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries and have aroused widespread attention. However, few studies have specifically investigated the impact of hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) disturbance generated by side reactions on the Zn anode and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a facile electrolyte additive strategy was introduced to break the OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; enrichment-induced bidirectional electrode degradation loop toward achieving stable Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells. Particularly, the bidirectional additive restricts the crossover of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing the iodine hydrolysis reaction-induced polyiodide formation and capturing polyiodides to prevent shuttling. It also preferentially interacts with Zn, simultaneously reconstructing the solvation shell and promoting the formation of a hybrid ZnS-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to improve Zn kinetics and inhibit HER. Therefore, a stable cycling of Zn//Zn cells can be sustained for 1700 and 400 h in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Impressively, the Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell achieved a cycle life of 9000 cycles at a high mass loading of 12 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The concept of bi-directional synergetic regulation for accounting for the aqueous environment is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Nitroso/Hydroxylamine Redox Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Organic Cathodes in Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>

N&#9552;O/NHOH redox chemistry, inspired by biological processes, enables proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron storage with high voltage and fast kinetics, providing a blueprint for high&#8208;capacity organic cathode materials for aqueous proton batteries.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials are emerging candidates for aqueous proton batteries due to their structural tunability and sustainability. However, the simultaneous realization of high voltage, low solubility, and high capacity remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce a biomimetic redox pair, nitroso/hydroxylamine (&#9472;N&#9552;O &#8652; &#9472;NH&#9472;OH), for the first time in energy storage systems. We report 1&#8208;(hydroxyamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (NHOH&#8208;A), a rationally designed aromatic hydroxylamine compound capable of undergoing a highly reversible proton&#8208;coupled two&#8208;electron redox process. Benefiting from its strong hydrogen bonding, uniform charge distribution, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, NHOH&#8208;A delivers a high discharge voltage of 1.15&#160;V, excellent capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1, and remarkable cyclability (&gt; 13,000 cycles) when coupled with a Zn anode. Furthermore, leveraging its intrinsic proton&#8208;donating capability, we construct a rocking&#8208;chair type all&#8208;organic proton battery by pairing NHOH&#8208;A with an alloxazine anode. The full cell maintains 164 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C (1 C = 224&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and delivers an energy density of 125&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, among the highest for all&#8208;organic proton batteries. This work establishes the N&#9552;O/NHOH chemistry as a promising redox platform, opening new avenues for developing advanced organic cathodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Highly Stable &#960;&#8209;Extended Viologen Functionalized Hybrid Lead Halides for Near Infrared&#8208;Driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly stable viologen&#8208;functionalized lead iodide framework featuring strong UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR absorption extending up to 965&#160;nm, achieving record&#8208;high NIR&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 photoconversion. The intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor architecture, combined with excellent carrier mobility in lead iodide layers, facilitates photoinduced charge separation and directs electrons toward adjacent N radical sites, effectively promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling for selective C2 product formation.








Abstract
Hybrid lead halides show great potential for CO2 photoreduction owing to their structural tunability and excellent photophysical properties. However, their intrinsic instability and the suppressed efficiency of C&#8211;C coupling under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation highlight the significant challenges of developing a stable, single&#8208;component photocatalyst with efficient NIR utilization. Herein, we incorporate &#960;&#8208;extended viologen units into two hybrid lead halides via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, forming intrinsic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) configurations. Dimensional modulation from 1D to 2D extends the NIR absorption to 965&#160;nm, affording a narrow bandgap of 1.28&#160;eV. The inherent D&#8211;A system, combined with excellent carrier mobility of lead halides, promotes efficient electron migration from the lead halide components to the viologen moieties, generating stable N&#8208;radical species. The resultant single&#8208;component photocatalyst achieves selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with high apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of 0.81% at 700(&#177;15)&#160;nm and 0.38% at 800(&#177;15)&#160;nm, exceeding typical NIR&#8208;responsive photocatalysts that typically generate C1 products. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the accumulated carriers enhance *CO intermediate formation on adjacent N radical sites with close proximity (&#8764;4.7&#160;&#197;), promoting *CO&#8211;CO coupling. This work presents an effective strategy for utilizing low&#8208;energy NIR light and drive CO2 conversion to high&#8208;value C2 hydrocarbons, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance metal halide photocatalysts.

Atomically dispersed transition metal modified Pt&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized via the ALD method, which are used to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of Ni and Fe against Pt in methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction, which was achieved by combining microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, DFT calculations. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited optimal activity and the lowest activation energies, attributed to moderate electronic modification against Pt.








Abstract
The electronic effects of bimetallic components in catalysis remain poorly understood. Herein, atomically dispersed transition metal (TM) modified platinum (Pt)&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized with the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Methanol steam reforming (MSR) was selected as a probe reaction to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) on Pt species. In situ/ex situ characterizations, isotope labeling, and DFT calculations reveal that different transition metals and ALD cycles tune the Pt electronic structure, significantly affecting catalytic activity. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits optimal electronic modification, achieving the highest MSR and water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) conversions and the lowest activation energies. Additionally, kinetic isotope effect studies confirm that hydrogen formation proceeds via methanol dehydrogenation coupled with WGS. These findings provide new insights into electronic modifications at atomic scales within the bimetallic components, offering valuable guidance for the design and development of advanced catalytic systems.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Driven Organelle Cross&#8208;Linking Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

This study designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that respectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, achieving precise spatial manipulation at the organelle level through molecular recognition. This approach selectively induced abnormal ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections and ultimately led to strong immunogenic cell death. This supramolecular recognition&#8208;based strategy provides a new perspective for precision medicine.








Abstract
Organelles maintain cellular homeostasis through highly specialized division of labor, dynamic interactions, as well as extensive inter&#8208;organellar information exchange, thereby ensuring the physiological functions of organisms. Although functionalized polymers that target a specific organelle to modulate or disrupt their function have been developed for therapeutic applications, macromolecular systems capable of manipulating two or more types of key organelles remain rare. Here, we designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that can respectively target endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, to achieve precise spatial manipulation of both organelles at the subcellular organelle level via a specific molecular recognition approach. This approach selectively induced unusual junctions between the ER and mitochondria, disrupting their functional synergy, triggering multiple cellular stress responses, such as Ca2+ homeostasis imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, energy metabolism disorder, and ultimately leading to severe immunogenic cell death (ICD). By converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, this strategy provides a supramolecular perspective for tumor immunotherapy.

This approach selectively induced unusual junctions between the ER and mitochondria, disrupting their functional synergy, triggering multiple cellular stress responses, such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, energy metabolism disorder, and ultimately leading to severe immunogenic cell death (ICD). By converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, this strategy provides a supramolecular perspective for tumor immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Photocatalytic Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Single&#8208;Atom Skeletal Editing</title>

Acridinium&#8208;based COFs (Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB) are synthesized via a single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement from xanthylium precursors. The resulting COFs possess high crystallinity, stability, redox activity, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB serves as an efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. 








Abstract
The rational synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with customized functionalities and enhanced stability requires innovative bond&#8208;forming strategies beyond conventional dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we report a novel single&#8208;atom skeletal editing approach to construct acridinium&#8208;based crystalline COFs through an irreversible Katritzky&#8208;type reaction. This strategy enables precise transformation of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;(2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylxanthylium) with either 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene&#8201;(TAPB)&#8201;or&#8201;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TADB) into acridinium&#8208;linked COFs, denoted as Acr&#8208;TAPB and Acr&#8208;TADB, respectively. The transformation proceeds via a unique single&#8208;atom oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen replacement, converting the xanthylium precursor into acridinium frameworks. The resulting COFs exhibit high crystallinity, robust stability, strong redox ability, and efficient charge separation. Notably, Acr&#8208;TADB functions as a highly effective metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative nucleophilic substitution and [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions, supporting gram&#8208;scale synthesis in both batch and flow reactors with excellent stability. This work establishes skeletal editing as a powerful strategy for engineering functionalized COF architectures for advanced applications.

         <title>Defects Induced in Situ Reconstruction of CdS with Oxygen&#8208;Tolerance Up to 23% in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective CdS&#8208;D showed superior oxygen tolerance than traditional CdS, maintaining a stable CO generation rate of 2.77&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 23% O2 (matching pure CO2 conditions). Defect&#8208;induced hole accumulation triggered oxidative reconstruction to active Cd2SO4(OH)2, enhancing CO2 adsorption and suppressing O2 adsorption, thus enabling high oxygen resistance.








Abstract
Direct driving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 from air or flue gas to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is very challenging due to the suppressing effect of the more favorable thermodynamically oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we presented a novel oxygen&#8208;involved reconstruction pathway on a unique defective CdS&#8208;D in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The material is highly tolerant to O2 and generates 2766.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of CO under visible light irradiation in the presence of up to 23% content of O2. Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the performance of CO2 reduction, the presence of oxygen positively promotes it, CO generation rate is up to 5124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after multiple experimental cycles. The meticulously structural analysis reveals that the CdS&#8208;D with abundant defects tended to accumulate photogenerated holes, and S2&#8722; is oxidized to SO42&#8722; in the presence of oxygen to produce Cd2SO4(OH)2 as the active center for preferable CO2 adsorption and inhibit the O2 adsorption, which is the root cause for the high tolerance of oxygen in CO2 reduction (CO2RR). This work reveals a unique reconstruction process of sulfides photo corrosion, which provides a new idea for realizing the direct conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 by omitting expensive carbon capture or purification in industrial carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Cu Evolution over Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta Zeolite Under H2 and Ethanol Atmospheres: Unveiling the Role of Diatomic Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between isolated Cu(II) and Y(III) sites in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts increase the energy barrier for Cu(II) reduction under H2 atmosphere at high temperature, contributing to distinct induction period during ethanol dehydrogenation compared with monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the dynamic evolution of Cu species under varying environmental conditions is critical for addressing challenges related to the activity and the stability of copper&#8208;based catalysts in thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electrocatalysis. However, metal&#8211;metal interactions between dual single atoms and their effects on Cu evolution after exposure to different environmental molecules remain underexplored. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts with dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts with isolated Cu sites in dealuminated Beta zeolites. By varying Cu and Y compositions, diatomic interactions were studied under H2 and ethanol atmospheres. With 6 wt% Y loading, approximately 0.4 wt% of Cu species in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta remained partially oxidized as Cu(I) after reduction in pure H2 at 350 &#176;C, in contrast to the full transition to metallic Cu observed in Cu&#8208;Beta. Combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with kinetic studies revealed that metallic Cu became the predominant species after reduction with H2 as Cu loading increased from 0.4 to 1.7 wt%, quadrupling the initial ethanol dehydrogenation rate and demonstrating the dominant role of Cu(0) sites. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory simulations indicated spatial proximity between dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and elucidated Cu speciation controlled by diatomic interactions.

         <title>Organic Ion&#8208;Mediated Electrostatic Shielding Facilitates Membrane&#8208;Free Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with LiFePO4 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free electrolysis is developed that synergistically integrates hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries. The redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl enables efficient electron transfer from LFP. An electrostatic shielding mechanism is employed by adding polyquaternium&#8208;7 to the electrolyte. This approach effectively minimizes the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by repelling them electrostatically from the electrode surface.








Abstract
Electrolytic water splitting is a cornerstone technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production. However, conventional methods face substantial challenges due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limitations imposed by ion&#8208;exchange membranes, highlighting the need for innovative approaches. This study introduces a novel, membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system that synergistically combines hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Central to this system is the redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (4&#8208;HO&#8208;TEMPO), which facilitates electron transfer from LFP. To mitigate parasitic reactions in the absence of a membrane, an electrostatic shielding mechanism is implemented through the addition of polyquaternium&#8208;7 (PQ&#8208;7) to the electrolyte. This strategy effectively suppresses the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by electrostatically repelling them from the electrode surface, as evidenced by rotating disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The proposed system achieves a remarkable hydrogen faradic efficiency of 92.4% and facilitates lithium ion recycling at a rate of 54.45&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Our work presents a straightforward yet effective strategy for membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis integrated with the sustainable recycling of spent LFP batteries through interfacial microenvironment control.

The redox cycling of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl enables efficient electron transfer from LFP. An electrostatic shielding mechanism is employed by adding polyquaternium-7 to the electrolyte. This approach effectively minimizes the unwanted reduction of redox-active species by repelling them electrostatically from the electrode surface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolytic water splitting is a cornerstone technology for sustainable hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. However, conventional methods face substantial challenges due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limitations imposed by ion-exchange membranes, highlighting the need for innovative approaches. This study introduces a novel, membrane-free electrolysis system that synergistically combines hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Central to this system is the redox cycling of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (4-HO-TEMPO), which facilitates electron transfer from LFP. To mitigate parasitic reactions in the absence of a membrane, an electrostatic shielding mechanism is implemented through the addition of polyquaternium-7 (PQ-7) to the electrolyte. This strategy effectively suppresses the unwanted reduction of redox-active species by electrostatically repelling them from the electrode surface, as evidenced by rotating disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The proposed system achieves a remarkable hydrogen faradic efficiency of 92.4% and facilitates lithium ion recycling at a rate of 54.45&#160;mmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work presents a straightforward yet effective strategy for membrane-free water electrolysis integrated with the sustainable recycling of spent LFP batteries through interfacial microenvironment control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Catalysts based on earth abundant cobalt {as cationic [LCoI]+} and readily available ligands are practical alternatives to prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;catalysts for intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes. Tunable phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligands enable an alternate intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition mode in 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. A mechanism that involves a cobaltacycle formed via intramolecular oxidative dimerization of the precursors is proposed.








Abstract
Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions have been extensively used for the syntheses of biologically active compounds including natural products. We have identified Co(I) complexes and optimal reaction conditions to accomplish highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. These catalysts, readily prepared from an earth&#8208;abundant metal and tunable ligands, serve as practical replacements for the prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;complexes previously used for similar reactions. The cationic complexes are readily prepared by the reaction of LCoX2 with Zn in the presence of NaBARF. Both neutral and cationic Co(I)&#8208;complexes of (S)&#8208;BINAP and (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINAP ligands effect the cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes giving the expected [4+2]&#8208;addition products in excellent selectivities. The [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of the less reactive 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes proceed only with the cationic complexes and 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;[(2S,5S)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane (PhBPE) and appropriately substituted phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) are the most optimal ligands for these reactions. Depending on the ligands, 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes bearing an aromatic substituent at the terminal position undergo an intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, giving cyclobutane products in very good yields and enantioselectivities. The absence of the corresponding [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition in the 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;yne substates may be related to the enhanced strain in the expected bicyclo[3.2.0]heptene products. A unified mechanism involving Co(I)/Co(III)&#8208;redox cycle, consistent with all available evidence, is proposed for these reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Stereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Sulfinylamines with Allenes</title>

An asymmetric copper&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides is reported, wherein the allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes is demonstrated to proceed with broad substrate scope, accompanied by excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Sulfinamides, pivotal scaffolds in modern organic synthesis, have undergone a continuous evolution of synthetic methodologies over the past century, yet the precise construction of sulfur stereocenters remains a significant synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a versatile catalytic asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of S&#8208;chirogenic allyl sulfinamides through the direct allylation of sulfinylamines with allenes. Our methodology employs a catalytic system comprising copper salts, hydrosilanes, and readily accessible chiral ligands, which facilitates the in situ generation of organocopper surrogates via hydrocupration of allenes. This approach demonstrates remarkable substrate scope and excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity across a diverse array of sulfinamide products. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations, including detailed experimental studies and computational analyses, have been conducted to elucidate the reaction pathway and identify the key factors governing enantioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H Functionalization of Nitramines for Accessing Bifunctional Energetic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H functionalization of nitramines enables the synthesis of molecules containing bifunctional energetic heterocycles with promising properties. A telescoped, HNO3&#8208;free sequence involving nitration and azolation steps offers a safer, modular, and scalable platform for the synthesis of energetic compounds.








Abstract
The synthesis of energetic materials (EMs) often involves hazardous reagents and harsh conditions, raising safety and environmental concerns. We herein present an electrochemical method for the &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H azolation of nitramines, enabling the integration of nitramines and various nitrogen&#8208;rich azoles as dual energetic components within the same molecule. To enhance the practicality of the overall synthesis, we developed a tandem two&#8208;step process that transforms free amines into nitramines using stable and readily available reagents, which was complemented by subsequent electrochemical azolation to complete a streamlined, scalable preparation of bifunctional energetic compounds. Finally, a continuous flow system was employed to further improve the practicality of the electrosynthetic method, which substantially reduced electrolyte usage and increased productivity. Computational and experimental data revealed that the introduction of azoles, particularly those with additional nitro substituents, improves the energy density and thermal stability of nitramines. This work provides a proof of concept that the reported electrochemical azolation reaction may not only offer a safer and more sustainable alternative to traditional approaches for energetic material synthesis, but it will also provide a platform for the discovery of novel compounds with favorable energetic properties.

         <title>Molecular Locking in Triplet Sensitization Amplifies Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular geometry matters: We employ nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots to sensitize triplet fusion upconversion, achieving a 43&#8208;fold CPL amplification and high upconversion efficiency. DFT simulation reveals that the record glum originates from the structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during triplet sensitization, maximizing the magnetic dipole moment.








Abstract
The potential of chiral organic molecules exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) for practical applications hinges on the luminescence efficiency and dissymmetry factor (glum). However, surpassing the molecular limitations of dissymmetry factors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the different parity selection rules governing the electric and magnetic dipole moments in chiral molecules. In this study, we tackle this inherent constraint by designing a triplet sensitization photon upconversion system using nontoxic CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) photosensitizer. We demonstrate a 43&#8208;fold amplification of CPL in QD&#8208;sensitized triplet fusion process compared to the direct photoexcitation. Notably, a high green&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion quantum efficiency of 12.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% (normalized to 100%) was achieved. The dissymmetry factors of QD&#8208;sensitized upconversion CPL outperform previous reports based on molecular photosensitizers. The observed large glum, according to our modeling and first&#8208;principles calculations, originates from the unique structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during the ultrafast triplet energy transfer process. Our work provides a new strategy and mechanistic insights for CPL amplification through triplet sensitization.

Notably, a high green-to-blue upconversion quantum efficiency of 12.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19% (normalized to 100%) was achieved. The dissymmetry factors of QD-sensitized upconversion CPL outperform previous reports based on molecular photosensitizers. The observed large &lt;i&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, according to our modeling and first-principles calculations, originates from the unique structural rearrangement of the chiral emitter during the ultrafast triplet energy transfer process. Our work provides a new strategy and mechanistic insights for CPL amplification through triplet sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>EII/EIVO (E&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn) Catalyzed Nitrous Oxide Activation and Chemodivergent Reduction of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent germanium and tin redox catalysis: Catalytic N2O activation at an EII/EIVO redox platform was reported using carbodiphosphorane&#8208;ligated germylene and stannylene as catalysts. Notably, the SnII&#8208;catalyzed reduction of nitroarenes, mediated by a SnII/SnIVO redox cycling, demonstrates excellent selectivity and enables the synthesis of four distinct reduced products under mild conditions.








Abstract
While homogeneous catalysis remains predominantly dominated by transition metal complexes, the utilization of main group compounds as redox catalysts for diverse chemical transformations represents a long&#8208;sought yet underexplored frontier. This work reports the catalytic reduction of N2O in the presence of HBpin via an unprecedented EII/EIVO (E&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn) redox platform, employing carbodiphosphorane ligated germylene or stannylene as the catalyst. The key GeIV and SnIV&#8208;oxo intermediates have been isolated and characterized. Furthermore, we extend this redox platform to achieve efficient and chemodivergent reduction of nitroarenes under mild conditions. Notably, through systematic modulation of reaction conditions, four different reduced products including amino, hydroxylamine, azoxy, and hydrazine derivatives can be synthesized from nitroarenes with high yields and selectivity. This work establishes a novel heavy group 14 element&#8208;based catalytic manifold and unlocks new opportunities for the application of heavy carbene analogues in redox catalysis.

         <title>Formation of Interconnected Nanofiber Sheets by Chemical Vapor Polymerization at the Free Surface of Liquid Crystalline Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation of a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional interconnected amine functionalized nanofiber network at a gas&#8211;liquid crystal interface by chemical vapor polymerization. The network forms via an interfacial phase separation pathway, revealing that the range of morphologies accessible via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystal is much greater than previously understood.








Abstract
We report that chemical vapor polymerization (CVP) of aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane into nematic liquid crystal (LC) films (thicknesses of 18&#160;&#181;m) yields quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional, sub&#8208;micron thick nanoporous polymer networks consisting of interconnected amine&#8208;functionalized nanofibers/nanowalls (widths of 30&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;nm). We establish that the polymer networks form at the free surface of the LC films with thicknesses ranging from 79&#160;&#177;&#160;5 to 280&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;nm and nanoscopic pores tunable via the choice of LC and monomer loading. Structural analysis using electron microscopy reveals the networks to possess morphologies ranging from open bicontinuous&#8208;like to cellular foam&#8208;like structures which, along with optical observations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, supports a synthesis pathway involving an interface&#8208;confined phase separation. MD simulations provide further insight into the atomic&#8208;scale processes determining the synthesis pathway, including the role of reactive precursor chemistry (e.g., hydroxymethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus [2.2]paracyclophane) in defining the nanostructure of the polymer product. Fluorescence and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm that the nanofiber sheets are decorated with primary amine groups, permitting covalent functionalization of the surfaces of the nanosheets. Finally, we show how the nanosheet synthesis can be integrated with existing membrane technology, illustrating the potential utility of the nanoporous sheets in a range of contexts, including filters, separators, and heat exchanger surfaces.

         <title>Synergistic Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis and Photocatalysis via TiO2@PTFE Composites for Efficient N2 to NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step synthesized TiO2@PTFE catalyst integrates contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis with photocatalysis, achieving 133.6 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 NH3 production under mild conditions. The synergy arises from improved dispersion, electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven charge separation, Fermi&#8208;level upshift, and enhanced N2 adsorption. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm dual&#8208;field&#8208;driven activation, providing a sustainable pathway for efficient nitrogen fixation and advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Catalytic nitrogen fixation from N2 and water under mild conditions offers a sustainable NH3 synthesis route. Herein, we report a synergistic nitrogen fixation strategy combining contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) with photocatalysis via one&#8208;step in situ hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 @PTFE catalyst, and achieved an activity of 133.6 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. It represents 10.9&#8208;fold and 7.5&#8208;fold enhancements over pristine TiO2 and PTFE, respectively, outperforming current CEC systems and many photocatalytic systems operating without sacrificial agents. Further characterization and theoretical calculations reveal the synergy: the composite catalyst enhances the CEC catalyst dispersion; the CEC&#8208;generated electric fields promote photogenerated charge separation and elevate the semiconductor's Fermi level, bolstering photocatalytic N2 reduction; conversely, the semiconductor boosts CEC efficiency via enhanced N2 adsorption and supplemental electron donation. We anticipate that this work establishes a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, providing novel insights into CEC&#8208;photocatalysis synergy and a pathway for rational design of high&#8208;performance nitrogen fixation catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Cascade Reaction Efficiency by Local pH Regulation for Integrated Anodic H2O2 Generation and Ammoximation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for efficient oxime synthesis. By regulating the local pH through electrolyte engineering, the system achieves 81% electron efficiency (EE) and 98% H2O2 utilization, offering a generalizable strategy for cascade electrochemical&#8211;chemical processes.








Abstract
Cascade reaction strategies integrating electrochemistry with chemical transformations offer routes for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the efficiencies of such integrated processes get compromised due to competitive electrochemical reactions and incompatibility between electrochemical and chemical transformations. We report an integrated electrochemical&#8211;chemical coupling of anodic H2O2 generation with ammoximation for oxime synthesis. An FTO/Sb2WO6 anode was designed and optimized to anodically produce H2O2 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87%. H2O2 from the anode oxidizes NH3 to NH2OH, which subsequently reacts with cyclohexanone to yield cyclohexanone oxime with 99% selectivity and a maximum electron efficiency (EE) of 81%. Continuous and adjustable H2O2 input ensures synchronization with the ammonia oxidation reaction while minimizing over&#8208;oxidation of the reaction intermediates. Operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) revealed local pH shifts caused by the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and its effect on the FE of H2O2 synthesis and competing NH3 oxidation, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing the reaction microenvironment. By regulating the electrolyte composition to modulate the interfacial pH, side reactions were suppressed and H2O2 generation was promoted, thereby enhancing cascade selectivity. This work highlights local pH regulation as a tool to improve reaction compatibility and efficiency in cascade electrosynthesis.

This work highlights local pH regulation as a tool to improve reaction compatibility and efficiency in cascade electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorophenyl and Trifluoromethylphenyl Terminal Groups: Enabling BT.2020&#8208;Targeted Narrowband Green Emission in High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically fusing diboron&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks with dibenzo[b,d]furan units and introducing fluorine&#8208;containing units as terminal substituents, highly efficient narrowband pure green&#8208;emitting multiple resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials can be developed, with precisely controlled emission peaks while maintaining a narrow full width at half maximum.








Abstract
To meet the critical demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) display technology, luminescent materials must achieve precise peak emission positions and narrow emission bandwidths simultaneously. Herein, we report a new class of narrowband pure green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3. These compounds are constructed on diborane&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) skeletons fused with a dibenzo[b,d]furan motif. Through strategic incorporation of three distinct terminal substituents, 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units, we further precisely modulate emission maxima while maintaining narrowband emission characteristics. All of these emitters exhibit bright green luminescence and narrowband emission characteristics, with luminescence peaks ranging from 513 to 518&#160;nm. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is only 14 to 16&#160;nm in dilute toluene solution. Additionally, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for all of these emitters exceed 95%. The corresponding optimized OLEDs based on DBNDO&#8208;1, DBNDO&#8208;2, and DBNDO&#8208;3 achieved peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 33.7%, 32.4%, and 32.0%, respectively. The CIEy coordinates for these OLEDs were 0.74, 0.75, and 0.75, with FWHM values ranging from 18.5 to 19.4&#160;nm. To the best of my knowledge, the EQEs, FWHM, and CIEy values represent some of the most exceptional performance metrics reported in the current literature.

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel electrochemical protocol for the deoxygenative arylation of bench&#8208;stable O&#8208;alkylisoureas as C(sp3) radical precursors via reductive activation. Combined with nickel catalysis, this methodology enables the deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of alcohol derivatives with a wide range of aryl electrophiles, offering a mild and efficient electrochemical strategy for C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods to employ naturally abundant alcohol derivatives as C(sp3) precursors for deoxygenative carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;coupling holds significant value for expanding sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space. While progress has been made in this area, the field lacks readily accessible, bench&#8208;stable alkylation reagents capable of undergoing reductive activation to generate alkyl radicals. Herein, we report an electroreductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed system for efficient C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) radical cross&#8208;coupling between aryl electrophiles (halides, triflates, tosylates, and boronic acids) and O&#8208;alkylisoureas as radical progenitors. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. Its synthetic utility is highlighted through the preparation of beclobrate analogs and bifonazole, as well as late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations support a radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Dual Spatial and Electronic Regulation in van der Waals Cu3Se2 Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3Se2 NSs are synthesized via chemical vapor transport and electrochemical exfoliation and feature in&#8208;plane Cu&#9472;Se frameworks and layered van der Waals structure. Spatial confinement and Cu 3d&#8211;Se 4p hybridization synergistically modulate Cu active sites, enabling &#960;&#8208;activation of acetylene, efficient H* utilization, and 90.6% FEethylene at 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability. 








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are promising for electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation to sustainable ethylene production, yet conventional catalysts suffer from a dilemma: contiguous Cu ensembles induce C&#9472;C coupling, while isolated Cu atoms on electronegative supports cause over&#8208;polarization and competing hydrogen evolution reaction, limiting selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene. Here, we report atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals Cu3Se2 nanosheets featuring a unique Cu&#9472;Se coordination that enables simultaneous spatial confinement and electronic modulation of Cu sites. The catalyst delivers a FEethylene over 90% at a current density of 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains &gt;90% FE for 25&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial and advanced Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies show that Cu 3d&#8208;Se 4p orbital hybridization tailors the density of states and d&#8208;band center, facilitating &#960;&#8208;orbital activation of acetylene, boosting active hydrogen utilization, and reducing the hydrogenation barrier. Simultaneously, it raises energy barriers for C&#9472;C coupling and H* recombination, suppressing C4 and H2 byproducts. This work positions van der Waals Cu3Se2 as a robust platform for selective ethylene production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Dual Formate Electrosynthesis via Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation and CO2 Reduction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

This study optimized CuxAg10&#8722;x catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration&#8208;dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&#8722; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO2RR achieved dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO3RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
Electrochemical formate (HCOO&#8722;) production via CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds great promise for carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu3Ag7 catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&#8722; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;VRHE. When coupled with CO2RR, the FOR||CO2RR system enabled dual&#8208;side HCOO&#8722; production, achieving a total HCOO&#8722; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an ultra&#8208;low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&#8722; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy&#8208;efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; catalysts, exhibiting superior FOR performance. We revealed HCHO concentration-dependent deactivation caused by HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation, highlighting the importance of electrolyte optimization. Coupling FOR with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR achieved dual-side HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production (0.39&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0.5&#160;V. Furthermore, FOR's versatility was demonstrated by pairing with HER, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR, and ORR to produce electricity and value-added chemicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) production via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) holds great promise for carbon-neutral energy systems; however, its practical implementation is significantly hindered by the high energy demand of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Replacing OER with a more energetically and economically favorable alternative anodic reaction is therefore essential. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu&#8211;Ag catalyst for anodic formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR). Systematic investigations employing in situ Raman spectroscopy and comprehensive electrochemical analyses revealed that Cu enables&#160;an earlier onset potential for FOR, and Ag enhances formaldehyde adsorption, leading to synergistically improved performance. The optimal Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited superior FOR performance, with an onset potential of&#160;&#8722;0.05&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) and Faradaic efficiencies for HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; exceeding 90% from 0.1 to 0.5&#160;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;. When coupled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, the FOR||CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR system enabled dual-side HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production, achieving a total HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; yield rate of 0.39&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultra-low cell voltage of 0.5&#160;V, surpassing the performance of previously reported electrochemical HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production systems. Furthermore, this study presents a versatile anodic strategy that integrates FOR with a range of cathodic reactions, offering an energy-efficient chemical synthesis approach for the advancement of sustainable electrochemical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable and Programmable Al8 Macrocycles for Advanced Dielectrics: Uniting High Permittivity, Minimal Loss, and Robust Moisture Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tunable macrocycles surface engineering, we developed solution&#8208;processable aluminum molecular ring (Al8)&#8208;based dielectric materials. Guided by theoretical calculations, the metal center engineering strategy significantly improved material synthesis efficiency. The designed Al8&#8208;based materials effectively addressed critical issues of conventional Al2O3 fillers, including interfacial hydrolysis and uneven polarization, achieving synergistic optimization of high permittivity, low loss, and superior moisture resistance.








Abstract
The development of polymer composite dielectrics exhibiting high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and excellent environmental stability is essential for enhancing field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) performance and reliability. While conventional high&#8208;&#954; materials like Al2O3 suffer from surface hydrolysis&#8208;induced polarization inhomogeneity, we present herein a molecular engineering solution through solution&#8208;processable and structurally programmable Al8 macrocycles. By employing computationally guided metal center and macrocycle surface engineering, we achieved highly efficient synthesis of solution&#8208;processable Al8&#8208;based dielectric materials. The resulting series of 10 structurally programmed Al8 macrocycles creates tailored electronic microenvironments, delivering exceptional dielectric properties: a threefold enhancement in dielectric constant compared to pure polymer matrices, remarkably low dielectric loss (tan &#948; = 0.064), and superior humidity resistance versus conventional Al2O3 fillers. This work establishes a comprehensive materials paradigm that simultaneously optimizes the critical dielectric parameters (&#954;, tan &#948;, and moisture resistance) while demonstrating the versatility of cluster molecular design.

         <title>Converting Residual Unstable PbI2 into Robust 2D Perovskite via Spacer Cation Engineering Toward Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering is developed, which stabilizes grain boundaries and thus improves device operational stability. The p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted devices incorporating guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) fulfill a champion efficiency of 26.19%, maintaining 92% of their initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation.








Abstract
Addressing light instability challenges induced by residual PbI2 is essential for simultaneously achieving high power conversion efficiency and excellent stability. Herein, we report an effective management strategy of residual photoactive PbI2 based on dimensional engineering. The guanfacine hydrochloride (GUFCl) as additive or interface modifier is used to modulate perovskite films, converting residual PbI2 at grain boundaries (GBs) into stable 2D perovskites, which suppresses the photodecomposition of perovskite films, inhibits ion migration and thus stabilizes GBs. The formation of 2D perovskites can result in reduced defect density and facilitated carrier transport and extraction, thereby mitigating carrier nonradiative recombination. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating GUFCl achieve a champion efficiency of 26.19% with significantly improved operational stability. The unencapsulated inverted PSC maintains 92% of its initial efficiency after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point (MPP) continuous tracking. This work provides a simple yet effective method to solve the residual PbI2&#8208;induced intrinsic instability issue, aiming to realize efficient, operationally stable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Generally Grafting Hydrophobic Polymer Brushes in Pure Water Through SIP of Phase Transfer Delivered Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a simple and versatile strategy for surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization (PTD&#8208;SIP), which employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) as a phase&#8208;transfer agent. This approach enables the surface&#8208;initiated polymerization of hydrophobic monomers in a pure aqueous phase, allowing precise synthesis of hydrophobic polymer brushes with different topologies and tunable physicochemical properties of material surface and interface.








Abstract
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes hold significant potential in antifouling, energy, medical, and lubrication applications. Because of rigorous polymerization conditions and requirements of organic solvents, research on hydrophobic polymer brushes is limited. Herein, we report a simple but efficient surface&#8208;initiated polymerization technique based on phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;delivered hydrophobic monomers (named PTD&#8208;SIP) that enables generally grafting hydrophobic brushes using minimal chemicals in an oxygen&#8208;tolerant environment with high end&#8208;group reactivity. This method employs methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CD) as a transport carrier to deliver hydrophobic monomers in water, eliminating the need for organic solvents. The PTD&#8208;SIP method enables easy alternating or simultaneous grafting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers and is applicable to various substrates and monomer types. Furthermore, reversible structural color has been achieved through rewritable surface&#8208;grafted polymer brushes, while permanent inorganic hybrid coatings provided expanded opportunities for applications in optics and tribology. These features make water&#8208;based hydrophobic polymer brushes a powerful tool for developing high&#8208;performance interfacial materials.

         <title>Unlocking Cryogenic Flexibility in Organic Crystals via Photoinduced E&#8594;Z Isomerization</title>

Organic crystals based on acylhydrazone derivatives fracture upon immersion in liquid nitrogen. After UV irradiation, they exhibit remarkable elastic bending at 77&#160;K. This strategy unlocks cryogenic elasticity in organic crystals.








Abstract
Dynamic tuning of mechanical properties in organic crystals remains a major challenge due to their intrinsic brittleness and rigidity, especially at cryogenic temperatures. Herein, we report the first example of light&#8208;induced cryogenic elasticity in organic molecular crystals via photoactivated E&#8594;Z isomerization. Crystals of a photoresponsive acylhydrazone derivative (NPH) undergo surface&#8208;localized isomerization upon 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, inducing partial surface melting while maintaining internal crystallinity. This remote, postsynthetic modulation dramatically enhances mechanical compliance, enabling irradiated crystals to exhibit elastic deformation and photomechanical bending even in liquid nitrogen (77&#160;K)&#8212;whereas nonirradiated crystals fracture upon immersion, with only the fragments retaining photomechanical activity. This work represents a breakthrough in mechanically reconfigurable molecular crystals and establishes a generalizable strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials operable in extreme environments. These findings open new avenues for the development of cryogenic actuators, adaptive optical systems, and low&#8208;temperature flexible electronics.

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Cluster Rhodium Catalyst for Efficient CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh single&#8208;cluster catalysts were designed for efficient thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. An unprecedented TOFRh of 595.2 h&#8722;1 with 95.3% ethanol selectivity and 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 ethanol yield was achieved over RhSC/CN. Mechanisms revealed by extensive characterizations and simulations demonstrate that Rh4 single&#8208;clusters facilitate efficient coupling of CH3* with CO* and benefit ethanol formation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is a promising strategy for efficient utilization of CO2. However, it remains a grand challenge to achieve a high ethanol yield due to the difficulty in accurate control of CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling under thermocatalytic reaction conditions. Herein, a precise rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;cluster catalyst on carbon nitride support (RhSC/CN) was designed for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The RhSC/CN catalyst, with an average Rh&#8211;Rh coordination number of 2.06, exhibits a record turnover frequency (TOFRh) of 595.2&#160;h&#8722;1, a high ethanol selectivity of 95.3% and an ethanol yield of 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 240&#160;&#176;C and 5.0&#160;MPa (H2/CO2&#160;=&#160;3), surpassing previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and H2/D2 isotope exchange probing experiments altogether reveal the reaction mechanism, and show that the synergetic interaction between Rh&#8211;Rh and Rh&#8211;N sites boosts CO2 adsorption and asymmetric C&#8211;C coupling between CH3* and CO* to form CH3CO*, leading to a high ethanol selectivity. This discovery provides new insights into the design of single&#8208;cluster catalysts for simultaneously promoting CO2 reactivity and ethanol&#160;selectivity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages for Ultrafast Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel metallo&#8208;cages were designed and self&#8208;assembled, exhibiting exceptional photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production. Through a bottom&#8208;up strategy, the metallo&#8208;cage were dispersed into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, achieving a record H2O2 production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported systems.








Abstract
In the realm of photocatalytic production, discrete metallo&#8208;organic cages have emerged as promising photocatalysts. However, their performance is often constrained by limited substrate accessibility and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel nonnoble metallo&#8208;cages, S1 and S2, and evaluated their photocatalytic activities. Benefit from the high structural stability, low exciton binding energy (52.9&#160;meV), ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (49.50&#160;ps), and prolonged excited&#8208;state lifetime (1, 970&#160;ps), S2 exhibits efficient charge carrier separation. In addition, a bottom&#8208;up approach was employed to disperse S2 into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, which significantly enhanced substrate accessibility and the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the addition of sodium oxalate not only optimizes charge carrier separation and utilization but also provides a kinetically favorable pathway for superoxide radical anion (&#183;O2&#8722;) generation, overcoming ORR kinetic bottlenecks. These synergistic effects culminate in a record production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported organic photocatalytic systems.

         <title>24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Single Polymer Chains Through Engineering&#8208;Compatible One&#8208;Pot Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;Hour&#8208;long afterglow from single polymer chains has been reported. The polymer chains emit an afterglow that lasts longer than 24&#160;h under ambient conditions. At &#8722;&#160;18&#160;&#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after photoexcitation cessation, making them the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymers reported to date. They can be activated by sunlight and maintain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air with potential applications in flexible displays and wearable devices.








Abstract
We report the unprecedented observation of 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) emission from single polymer chains. The polymer chains were synthesized through a straightforward engineering&#8208;compatible one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction. These polymers exhibit afterglow emissions exceeding 24&#160;h under ambient conditions through charge separation and recombination mechanisms. Remarkably, these HLA polymers can be activated by sunlight and sustain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air, rendering them suitable for practical engineering applications. Notably, the HLA is temperature&#8208;dependent, with lower temperatures substantially prolonging emission duration. At &#8722;&#160;18 &#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after ceasing photoexcitation, establishing these polymers as the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymeric materials reported to date. Moreover, the excellent processability of the 24&#8208;HLA polymers allows their facile fabrication into diverse forms including films and fibers using conventional polymer processing techniques, positioning them as promising candidates for flexible displays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Asymmetric Acetylene Activation Enables Enhanced Electrochemical Ethylene Formation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived Cu nanoparticles have been constructed to modulate the interfacial electron distribution to regulate the hydrogenation rate and increase both the C2H4 selectivity and the C2H2 hydrogenation activity to improve the ethylene formation kinetics. In addition, the origin of the enhanced C2H4 formation kinetics is the asymmetric C2H2 adsorption over the OD Cu&#8211;B NPs.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts with weak ethylene (C2H4) adsorption exhibit a robust ability to suppress the overhydrogenation of electrocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation (EAH), providing a green alternative for C2H4 production. However, the unsatisfactory C2H4 formation kinetics due to the sluggishness of C2H2 reactants still limit its practical application potential. Herein, borate&#8208;decorated oxide&#8208;derived copper nanoparticles (OD Cu&#8211;B NPs) are designed to promote C2H2 activation and adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts deliver a partial current density of 720 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 48.33 s&#8722;1, greatly outperforming the bare OD Cu counterpart. The symmetric electron distribution of C2H2 is revealed to be broken over the Cu&#8211;borate interface, making it easier to activate and adsorb, which accounts for the lowered hydrogenation barrier and enhanced selectivity, consequently promoting C2H4 formation kinetics through the EAH process.

The symmetric electron distribution of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed to be broken over the Cu&#8211;borate interface, making it easier to activate and adsorb, which accounts for the lowered hydrogenation barrier and enhanced selectivity, consequently promoting C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation kinetics through the EAH process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Robust Heterometallic Pt2Pd2L8 Double Cage Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterometallic Pt(II)&#8211;Pd(II) quadruply interlocked cage catenane (Pt2Pd2L8) has been assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. The integration of inert Pt(II) and labile Pd(II) ions within the architecture enables facile catenation while strongly enhancing stability of the assembly.








Abstract
The combination of different metal ions in supramolecular structures can lead to the emergence of new features, such as enhanced stability, reduced symmetry, and peculiar reactivity. Mechanically interlocked architectures containing dissimilar metal ions are still scarce. Herein, we report the first example of a heterometallic, quadruply interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 cage catenane, assembled via a combination of metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry. While direct complexation of the used asymmetric ligand with a mixture of Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions could yield 14 different monomeric and 576 interlocked cage products, the chosen approach allowed us to selectively obtain one PtPdL4 monomeric cage and a single Pt2Pd2L8 double cage isomer as major products, respectively, depending on the reaction conditions. In the obtained interlocked Pt2Pd2L8 structure, the kinetically inert Pt(II) ions are positioned peripherally, while the more labile Pd(II) ions are buried and interlocked within the cage interior, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The resulting catenane structure exhibits an enhanced kinetic stability, resisting disassembly in the presence of excess competitive ligands such as halide anions, unlike previously reported Pd(II) cage catenanes. Furthermore, the Pt2Pd2L8 cage binds halide anions with high affinity, enabling efficient sequestration of halides from organic substrates.

         <title>Boosting the Ionic Conductivity of Non&#8208;Aqueous Proton Electrolyte for Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized 80&#160;m H3PO4/EA electrolyte achieves the highest ionic conductivity among reported non&#8208;aqueous proton electrolytes, enabling the MoO3//AC capacitor with ultrahigh power density, extended cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability. 








Abstract
Proton batteries have emerged as promising alternatives for energy storage owing to their rapid H&#8314; transport kinetics and environmental sustainability. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;art proton batteries using aqueous acid electrolytes suffer from severe hydrogen evolution, electrode dissolution, and narrow electrochemical windows. Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could obviate these challenges, while they are typically limited by low ionic conductivity. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated proton transport mechanism is revealed in the phosphoric acid/ethyl acetate (H3PO4/EA) electrolytes with various concentrations. The optimized non&#8208;aqueous H3PO4/EA electrolyte (80&#160;m) simultaneously achieves high ionic conductivity (21.8&#160;mS cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical stability window (2.5&#160;V), wide operational temperature range (&#8722;80 to 200&#160;&#176;C), and minimal corrosiveness. Using this electrolyte, the MoO3//AC hybrid capacitor demonstrates ultrahigh power density (13292&#160;W kg&#8722;1), extended cycling stability (10&#160;000 cycles), and unprecedented temperature adaptability (&#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C). Our findings provide fundamental insights into non&#8208;aqueous proton conduction mechanisms and establish new design principles for practical proton energy storage systems.

         <title>Si&#8722;H Activation via Dynamic Permutational Isomerism: A Ligand&#8208;Directed Route to Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;controlled dynamic permutational isomerism in pentacoordinate silicon intermediates enables metal&#8208;free dehydrogenative Si&#9472;O coupling. The accessibility of axial hydride positions dictates whether Si&#9472;H bond activation or Si&#9472;N bond cleavage occurs, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding hydrogen release and coupling processes in silicon chemistry.








Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DHC) of hydridosilanes with silanols under metal&#8208;free conditions provides a sustainable route to Si&#9472;O bond formation. Yet, the mechanistic origin of hydrogen release in such systems has remained unclear. Here, we show that dynamic permutational isomerism of pentacoordinate silicon intermediates is a key prerequisite for Si&#9472;H activation and H2 release. Using sterically tailored diaminohydridosilanes, we demonstrate that only ligands enabling access to axial hydride configurations facilitate Si&#9472;O coupling with productive H2 elimination. In contrast, N&#8211;tert&#8208;butyl substitution locks the hydride in the equatorial position and diverts reactivity toward Si&#9472;N bond cleavage. Multinuclear variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy, combined with quantum chemical calculations, reveals an equilibrium between equatorial and axial hydride configurations, enabling Berry pseudorotation and hydrogen evolution. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for H2 release in hydridosilicates and establish ligand&#8208;directed isomerism as a general design principle for selective, metal&#8208;free Si&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Sustainable Fluorinated Silicon Dielectric Design for Enhanced Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>

Fluorinated silicon powder, synthesized via mild self&#8208;assembly, enhances CE Chemistry efficiency by 30&#8208;fold for dye degradation and enables noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free iodine oxidation, offering a sustainable alternative to fluoropolymers.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification (CE) has recently emerged as a powerful means of initiating interfacial chemical reactions via charge transfer. Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are frequently employed as solid dielectrics owing to their fluorine&#8208;rich surfaces, which exhibit strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics. However, their high environmental cost and poor surface modifiability hinder the broader adoption of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;chemistry (CE&#8208;Chemistry). Here, we report a low&#8208;cost and tunable dielectric alternative based on silicon powder, surface&#8208;functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains to mimic the interfacial properties of conventional fluoropolymers. Fluorinated silicon powders (F&#8208;Si) were synthesized via a mild self&#8208;assembly approach using 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The resulting F&#8208;Si powders exhibited a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in methyl orange degradation efficiency compared to unmodified silicon, and a 4&#8208;fold improvement in phenol degradation relative to size&#8208;matched FEP powder. In contrast, aggressive fluorination via piranha&#8208;assisted pretreatment (P&#8208;F&#8208;Si) induced particle aggregation and loss of CE reactivity, highlighting the importance of controlled surface engineering. Furthermore, CE&#8208;Chemistry enabled the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxidation of I&#8722; to I3&#8722;, establishing a low&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective paradigm for catalytic iodine conversion. Together, these advances provide a sustainable materials design framework for CE&#8208;Chemistry, with broad implications for scalable, green chemical transformation technologies.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Locking Strategy Enables Volatile Ether Organic Electrolytes to Achieve High&#8208;Energy Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;locking subnanometer&#8208;nanowire gel electrolytes (SNWGE) enable high&#8208;energy Li cells from ether solutions. Three&#8208;dimensional network traps nonpolar solvent and promotes salt dissociation, yielding high ionic conductivity, wide potential window, and robust interfaces. Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells retain 88.5% (670th) and Li&#8211;air cells operate&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles. At 28.5% of commercial carbonate electrolyte cost, SNWGE offers a scalable, durable, and intrinsically safer electrolyte platform.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal batteries are constrained by safety and lifespan owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. Here, we report a synergy of molecular&#8208;locking and gelation treatment by cations&#8211;bridged polyoxometalate subnanometer nanowires (SNW), which facilitates using ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy Li metal batteries. The formed SNW&#8208;based gel electrolyte (SNWGE) exhibits continuous three&#8208;dimensional networks that effectively capture nonpolar ether electrolytes and promote the dissociation of Li salts, eliminating the risks of electrolyte leakage and volatilization. Homogeneous and continuous Li+ fast transport channels were created in the SNWGE through intermolecular interactions, contributing to sufficient ionic conductivity (1.26 mS cm&#8722;1), high oxidative stability (up to 5.0&#160;V versus Li+/Li), and good solid/cathode electrolyte interphase formation capability. The SNWGE enables the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells to reach good cyclability (over 88% capacity retention after 670 cycles), excellent low&#8208;temperature, and abuse&#8208;tolerant properties. Notably, the cost of the SNWGE is only 28.5% of the commercial electrolyte (1&#160;M lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), highlighting its significant potential for industrial application. When the SNWGE is tested in Li&#8211;air batteries, a stable cycling of&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles was obtained. The electrolyte design paves a promising path for highly energetic, durable, and safe rechargeable Li metal batteries.

         <title>Delocalized Frustrated Lewis Pairs in COF&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Transfer for Urea Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COF photocatalyst, where F&#8208;functionalization creates electron&#8208;delocalized Fe&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). The FLPs selectively adsorb and activate NO3&#8722; at Fe sites and CO2 at keto oxygen atoms, while enhancing charge separation and weakening Fe&#9472;N bonds to promote *NHx intermediate transfer, thereby enabling efficient photosynthesis of urea from CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;reduction. 








Abstract
Photosynthesis of urea through C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrates (NO3&#8722;) represents a sustainable route for both carbon utilization and environmental remediation, yet remains fundamentally challenging due to competing parallel reduction reactions. Building upon hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base principles, we demonstrate that electronic delocalization modulation in iron (Fe)&#8208;keto oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) can effectively suppress these reductions while selectively promoting C&#9472;N coupling. To realize this strategy, we engineered a fluorinated Fe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (Fe/F&#9472;COF) photocatalyst, where F functionalization modulates the electronic structure to create electron&#8208;delocalized FLPs with precisely controlled Fe&#8208;keto oxygen spatial spacing at 3.4 &#197;. Experimental and computational results reveal that F&#8208;induced electron delocalization enhances Lewis acidity at Fe sites for NO3&#8722; activation and increases basicity at keto oxygen for the CO2 activation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;delocalized Fe center exhibits softened acid character that weakens the Fe&#8208;N bond in adsorbed *NH species, facilitating N&#8208;transfer for C&#9472;N coupling. Such spatial and electronic configuration lowers the C&#9472;N coupling barrier, favoring *NHCO intermediate formation and subsequent urea production. The Fe/F&#8208;COF achieves a high urea yield rate of 93 &#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 1.1% at 400 nm, surpassing most reported photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction coupling systems to date.

Abstract
Carbon materials, renowned for their exceptional intrinsic properties, play a pivotal role in the domain of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially for encasing delicate metal&#8208;based catalysts. However, this encasement hinders the precise control of catalytic capacity because carbon's inherent &#963;&#8208;bonding complicates direct changes to the material's surface atomic and electronic structure. Herein, a universal fresh perspective is reported that remotely and precisely reverse manipulation the surface electronic structure of carbon host by driving electron pumping, accumulation, Li ion diffusion and facilitate covalent interactions with polysulfides using s&#8208;d block high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (CoNiCuMnMg@C). Theoretical calculation optimization results confirm that polysulfides stabilize at the Carbon interface rather than directly at the alloy surface so as to avoid its being poisoned. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and KPFM results shed light on that coupling with high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys, especially with highly exotic Mg, reduces the work function and enhances the electron density signaling that an electron deviation from alloy to C (Hershfield charge of &#8722;0.34 e), which in turn enhances the electron&#8208;rich carbon's ability to strongly adsorb Li+. The CoNiCuMnMg@C catalyst boosts Li+ diffusion and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The CoNiCuMnMg@C/S cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity and capacity retention. This novel strategy provides new horizons for high&#8208;effective catalyst design.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystal Films for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

This work presented a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy achieved unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.0%, and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32 nm. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;efficient displays and eye&#8208;healthy lighting technologies. However, CP&#8208;OLEDs obtained from conventional chiral luminescent materials face critical limitations, including insufficient electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and broad emission bandwidths, which collectively impede their practical application. Herein, we proposed a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs. Firstly, chiral inducers (P/M&#8208;THH) were incorporated into the N&#8208;LC (2PFP) host. Subsequent thermal annealing yielded intrinsically luminescent N*&#8208;LCs films exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| up to 1.33. Introducing the achiral energy acceptor BCz&#8208;BN at optimal concentrations enabled efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (&#934;ET&#160;=&#160;99%), producing ternary co&#8208;assembled N*&#8208;LCs films. These films retained the nematic order while inheriting the narrowband emission and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of BCz&#8208;BN. This approach achieves unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum EQE of 9.0%, and narrowband electroluminescence with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. These findings establish a novel pathway for fabricating high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs and open up a new avenue for exploring the chiral optoelectronic application.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) have emerged as promising candidates for energy-efficient displays and eye-healthy lighting technologies. However, CP-OLEDs obtained from conventional chiral luminescent materials face critical limitations, including insufficient electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;), low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and broad emission bandwidths, which collectively impede their practical application. Herein, we proposed a strategy utilizing co-assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*-LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high-performance CP-OLEDs. Firstly, chiral inducers (&lt;i&gt;P/M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-THH&lt;/b&gt;) were incorporated into the N-LC (&lt;b&gt;2PFP&lt;/b&gt;) host. Subsequent thermal annealing yielded intrinsically luminescent N*-LCs films exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 1.33. Introducing the achiral energy acceptor &lt;b&gt;BCz-BN&lt;/b&gt; at optimal concentrations enabled efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (&#934;&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;99%), producing ternary co-assembled N*-LCs films. These films retained the nematic order while inheriting the narrowband emission and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of &lt;b&gt;BCz-BN&lt;/b&gt;. This approach achieves unprecedented CP-OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| value of 0.61, a maximum EQE of 9.0%, and narrowband electroluminescence with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. These findings establish a novel pathway for fabricating high-performance CP-OLEDs and open up a new avenue for exploring the chiral optoelectronic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Diamine Synthesis for Covalent Organic Frameworks: Boosted Photocatalytic Performance by Restricting &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine Bond Twist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing nonlinear connections through C1h ligand, the twist of linkers caused by &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond is restricted. This approach maintains the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, facilitating electron separation and transport, thereby boosting photocatalytic performance, such as the production of H2O2.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are typically formed by the covalent bonding of geometrically symmetrical linkers. In this work, an asymmetric (C1h symmetry) amine linker (2,6&#8208;diaminobenzothiazole) was employed to non&#8208;linearly connect and synthesize the COFs (TpBa) featuring &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond, which lead to the discovery of interesting &#8220;angle&#8208;induced restricted twist (AIRT)&#8221; effect. Compared with the COFs TpPa and TpDa with geometrically symmetrical linkers, the presence of asymmetric amine moieties in TpBa introduced certain angles between building blocks, mitigating the twist of the molecular plane caused by spatial steric hindrance on both sides of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bonds thereby preserving the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Although TpDa exhibited a more favorable charges structure and distribution for separation and transport, TpBa demonstrated superior H2O2 yield, suggesting the potential dominance of the AIRT effect under specific conditions. This work not only expands the option for COFs linker selection but also provides insights into boosting the photocatalytic performance of COFs.

         <title>Bi&#9472;O Bridges Trigger Lattice Strain&#8208;Electronic Synergy at Inherent In Sites in ZnIn2S4 for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic Bi&#9472;O coordination in ZnIn2S4 triggers synergistic lattice strain and electronic rearrangement to activate Inherent In sites, significantly optimizing charge carrier dynamics and stabilizing key intermediates, thus enabling dual&#8208;site O2 adsorption&#8211;conversion and functioning as a proton reservoir. This design achieves an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate (6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency (2.32%) with 97.3% selectivity for the 2e&#8722; pathway.








Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents represents a promising yet challenging route for sustainable chemical production, hindered by low solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency (natural photosynthesis is only &#8764;0.1%). Notably, the abundant inherent active sites within base semiconductors remain substantially underutilized. Here, we incorporate Bi into ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) lattices through atomic&#8208;level Bi&#9472;O coordination, activating inherent In sites via synergistic lattice strain and electron rearrangement. Multiscale characterization confirms the formation of BiO2S2&#8211;ZIS with quantified 1.51% lattice elongation. Integrated theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses reveal that Bi&#9472;O coordination increases electron density at adjacent In sites, which lowers the p&#8208;band center and enhances carrier separation. Meanwhile, lattice strain strengthens Bi&#9472;O orbital hybridization and weakens In&#9472;O covalency. Thus, these effects cooperatively optimize carrier dynamics. Then, the O2 adsorption is Pauling&#8208;type at In site to Yeager&#8208;type adsorption at the In&#9472;Bi dual sites. Simultaneously, Bi&#9472;O bridges function as proton reservoirs to facilitate *OOH formation and *H2O2 synthesis through enhanced Coulombic interactions. The resulting strain&#8208;electron synergy achieves an unprecedented H2O2 production rate of 6.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and 2.32% SCC efficiency, surpassing all reported inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts. This work demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance and establishes a highly effective strategy for inherent site activation.

         <title>Programmable Ultralong Phosphorescent Ionogels for Intelligent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly tough room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) ionogels (77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) has been fabricated with long lifetimes (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, &#964;&#160;&#8776;&#160;5.23&#160;s) and broad color gamut (from deep blue to NIR&#8208;I). The ionogels have been integrated into real&#8208;time strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring, smart conductive materials, as well as intelligent grippers, thus demonstrating their potential application in smart materials. 








Abstract
Pure organic flexible RTP materials show broad application prospects in fields such as electronic sensing and high&#8208;resolution displays. IGs offer advantages over conventional soft matter due to their high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and low volatility. However, flexible IGs often fail to provide sufficient rigidity to protect triplet excitons from environmental quenching, presenting a challenge in the development of RTP&#8208;IGs. Additionally, these materials may encounter unforeseen circumstances during operation that compromise their functional integrity, affecting real&#8208;time monitoring effectiveness. Developing novel IG systems with excellent RTP properties and real&#8208;time monitoring capabilities is thus urgent and meaningful. This work fabricated a novel, mechanically outstanding IG material (toughness&#160;&#8776;&#160;77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) serving as an excellent matrix for flexible RTP materials. A trace doping strategy endowed these materials with ultralong full&#8208;color RTP (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, lifetime up to 5.23&#160;s), demonstrating potential for real&#8208;time operational state monitoring. These systems were applied in strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring materials, smart conductive systems, and an intelligent thermally driven claw.

         <title>Spin Interactions in Supramolecular Assemblies of Porphyrin Oligomer Radical Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;strand porphyrin ladder complexes offer an excellent way to hold two spin centers in a well&#8208;defined structure. Nutation experiments on the dianion of such complexes confirm the presence of doublet and triplet species. Spin dynamics simulations show that the emergence of these higher multiplicities can be fully accounted for by considering the dipolar interaction between electron spins.








Abstract
Diradicals have potential applications in spintronics, molecular electronics, and dynamic nuclear polarization due to their unique electronic structure. Supramolecular diradicals are particularly attractive, as changes in conformation can be used to switch the spin state. In this work, we explore a class of supramolecular diradicals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of charged zinc porphyrin oligomers with bidentate ligands such as 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and 4,4'&#8208;bipyridyl. Field&#8208;dependent nutation experiments on the anions of porphyrin ladder complexes show nutation frequencies corresponding to doublet and triplet species, which can both be attributed to the same spin system using simulations based on the time evolution of the density matrix.

&lt;p&gt;Double-strand porphyrin ladder complexes offer an excellent way to hold two spin centers in a well-defined structure. Nutation experiments on the dianion of such complexes confirm the presence of doublet and triplet species. Spin dynamics simulations show that the emergence of these higher multiplicities can be fully accounted for by considering the dipolar interaction between electron spins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diradicals have potential applications in spintronics, molecular electronics, and dynamic nuclear polarization due to their unique electronic structure. Supramolecular diradicals are particularly attractive, as changes in conformation can be used to switch the spin state. In this work, we explore a class of supramolecular diradicals formed by the self-assembly of charged zinc porphyrin oligomers with bidentate ligands such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and 4,4'-bipyridyl. Field-dependent nutation experiments on the anions of porphyrin ladder complexes show nutation frequencies corresponding to doublet and triplet species, which can both be attributed to the same spin system using simulations based on the time evolution of the density matrix. Density functional theory was used to calculate dipolar coupling tensors and provided insights into the electronic structure of these double-stranded&#160;assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous PtPd Alloy &#8208; High Entropy Oxide Heterostructures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthetic approach has been developed to obtain mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO heterostructures via in situ assembly from MOF&#8208;derived HEAs. Excellent catalytic efficiency and durability for MOR are exhibited by the resulting material, with performance significantly outperforming that of commercial benchmarks. 








Abstract
The widespread adoption of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has been significantly hindered by the low activity of commercial noble metal catalysts toward the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and their susceptibility to CO poisoning. To address these challenges, a mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO (HEO&#160;=&#160;high entropy oxide) heterostructure is assembled in situ from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived high entropy alloy (HEA) in this work. Mass activity exceeding that of commercial Pt/C by more than an order of magnitude is demonstrated by this catalyst. A peak power density of 155&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term operational stability are achieved in a DMFC assembled with mesoporous PtPd&#8208;HEO, surpassing the performance of cells based on Pt/C and PtPd/C. In situ spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the valence electronic structure of the PtPd alloy is modulated by the HEO component, resulting in improved selectivity for non&#8208;CO pathways and increased formation of reactive hydroxyl species. Superior MOR catalytic activity and durability for PtPd&#8208;HEO are attributed to this synergistic electronic tuning and the porous structure. The development of HEO&#8208;based mesoporous heterostructures is proposed as a promising strategy for the design of next&#8208;generation catalysts in energy conversion and sustainable technologies.

         <title>Ph2SCCO: A New Versatile CCO&#8208;Fragment Transfer Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the unprecedented heterocumulene Ph2SCCO is presented. Starting from simple precursors, Ph2SCCO provides direct access to the valuable class of (bicyclic) &#945;&#8208;cyclopropylcarbonyl compounds. It has emerged from our reactivity studies as an excellent reagent for the CCO fragment transfer in organic synthesis.








Abstract
ketenylidene (C2O) is an electronically intriguing small molecule with significant potential as a C2 synthon in organic synthesis. However, its high reactivity has thus far precluded practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new reagent, the heterocumulene Ph2S&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O (1), a well&#8208;defined C2O equivalent that accurately replicates the chemical reactivity profile of C2O in a controlled manner. 1 uniquely integrates ketene&#8208;like and classical carbene reactivity. In the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids, 1 undergoes initial 1,2&#8208;addition to form a sulfur ylide intermediate, which can be exploited for subsequent reactions including cyclopropanation, epoxidation, or X&#8211;H addition. The CCO fragment transfer strategy, starting from simple precursors, enables efficient access to &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208; as well as &#945;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;carbonyl derivatives and structurally complex bicyclic cyclopropanes.

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries face a critical challenge in synergistically optimizing high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading redox kinetics and suppressing soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a self&#8208;phase&#8208;separating electrolyte design strategy based on heterogeneous LiPSs dissolution characteristics, using co&#8208;solvents of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) to induce spontaneous phase separation during LiPSs dissolution through solvation disparity. The constructed electrolyte system facilitates formation of a strong&#8208;solvation region at the cathode to maintain rapid sulfur redox kinetics while establishing a weak&#8208;solvation region at the anode to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby achieving dual objectives of &#8220;kinetics promotion and shuttle suppression&#8221; via a spatially partitioned dual&#8208;zone synergistic mechanism. This strategy enables steady cycling above 170 cycles of single&#8208;layer Li&#8208;S pouch cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathodes (4.3 mgs cm&#8722;2). Moreover, under practical lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions (6.2 mgs cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading, 50&#160;&#181;m Li, 3&#160;&#181;L mgs&#8722;1 electrolyte), a 1.8 Ah multi&#8208;layer pouch cell delivers 323&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density with stable cycling above 50 cycles. This work provides an effective solution for resolving the critical trade&#8208;off between rapid sulfur conversion kinetics and stable anode interfacial behavior in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetraarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of structurally novel axially chiral tetraarylethenes has been synthesized for the first time through an electrophilic aromatic substitution of phenols with 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones, facilitated by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. The resulting highly enantioenriched products enable further stereospecific elaborations to yield chiral materials with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.








Abstract
Chiral TAEs hold great promise for the development of optically active materials. However, current strategies for constructing such structures are largely limited to introduce spatially distal central chirality or intrinsically helical chirality. In this work, we have incorporated axial chirality to create a novel class of skeletally innovative atropisomeric TAEs for the first time. A CPA&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of prochiral TAEs has been established, enabled by an enantioselective aromatic substitution of phenols using 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones as electrophiles. This method achieves excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol for all attempted substrates under the optimized conditions. The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE&#8208;based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.

The resulting highly enantioenriched TAEs enable stereospecific modifications to produce a diverse range of axially chiral TAEs. This work not only complements existing achievements but also provides a rapid and efficient route to access TAE-based chiroptical devices with favorable asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[3]CycloBODIPY: A Highly Strained Cyclic BODIPY Trimer with Effective Macrocyclic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic [3]cycloBODIPY, composed solely of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) units, was synthesized via gold&#8208;mediated cyclization. Despite its high strain energy (86.4&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1), flexible boron centers help disperse the strain. The macrocycle shows near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 1050&#160;nm due to BODIPY deformation and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. 








Abstract
Cyclic oligomers containing porphyrinic chromophores have attracted significant attention in broad areas of science as artificial models for photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting antennae due to their structural and functional resemblance to natural chlorophyll arrays. Here, the synthesis of a macrocyclic [3]cycloBODIPY derivative, which consists of only boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) units, via an Au&#8208;mediated macrocyclization protocol is reported. While this [3]cycloBODIPY derivative exhibits a high total strain energy of 86.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, part of the intrinsic strain is effectively dispersed due to the flexible boron centers. Furthermore, this [3]cycloBODIPY derivative exhibits near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1050&#160;nm as the result of two electronic modulation factors, i.e., deformation of the BODIPY subunits and effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the entire macrocycle.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineering of Au&#8211;Ag Nanoclusters Enables Divergent Triplet Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle structural changes in Au&#8211;Ag nanoclusters with an identical Au6 core give rise to distinct triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence: Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, while Au6Ag4 shows dual emission involving phosphorescence and TADF, driven by differences in metal&#8211;ligand interactions and excited&#8208;state electronic coupling.








Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state&#8208;based luminescence holds great promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic materials, yet its mechanistic modulation through structural control remains a fundamental challenge for nanomaterials. Here, we present a comparative study of two atomically precise nanoclusters, Au6Ag2 and Au6Ag4, which feature an identical Au6 core but differ subtly in Ag atom count and ligand coordination. Despite their structural similarity and triplet dominated emission origin, the results herein reveal that Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, whereas Au6Ag4 demonstrates dual emission involving both phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The contrasting behaviors arise from fine&#8208;tuning the silver contents and organic ligands, which alters photoluminescence nature without modifying the metal core. This work highlights a structure&#8208;driven approach to regulating triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence in metal nanoclusters and offers a blueprint for designing next&#8208;generation triplet&#8208;emissive materials.

         <title>Lean&#8208;Water Gel Electrolyte Enables Zinc Ion Battery at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study developed a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer system formed by in situ polymerization of the DOL strategy, which exhibits excellent performance at low temperatures of &#8722;70 &#176;C due to its fast kinetic process. It can also change the storage model of H+ in the cathode, prevent electrode passivation, and achieve stable cycling under high loads. 








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are attracting growing interest in electrochemical energy storage due to safety, reliability, and affordability. However, water brings drawbacks including parasitic reactions, narrow electrochemical window, and cathode degradation. The freezing nature of water also challenges the zinc ion transport and storage at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, especially below &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Here, we design a water&#8208;in&#8208;polymer electrolyte to confine water using a weak&#8208;solvation monomer&#8208;directed polymerization technique initiated by protons. This electrolyte strategy significantly suppresses the water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and widens the electrochemical window to 2.59&#160;V. Besides, a high ionic conductivity of 0.36&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 is achieved at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C benefiting from unique fast ion transport channel and favorable desolvation process at the interface. Symmetric Zn cells exhibit excellent cycle stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h (437 days) at room temperature (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@1 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 700&#160;h at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (5.25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@5.25 mAh cm&#8722;2). Zn||Zn0.58V2O5 full cells show impressive performance under high mass loading and low temperatures originating from the suppression of H+ insertion. The electrolyte strategy in this work will inspire more efforts for water confinement in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridge&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes by Catalytic Metal Carbene Insertion into Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion reaction into bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been developed. This method enables access to previously unattainable 2&#8208;functionalized BCPs featuring quaternary and tertiary bridges, with high yields and broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a stepwise addition pathway with excellent regioselectivity, which avoids diene fragmentation. 








Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are emerging saturated hydrocarbon bioisosteres for polysubstituted benzenes; however, their synthesis from bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) via direct metal carbene insertion remains unrealized. Herein, we report the first catalytic metal carbene insertion into BCBs using triftosylhydrazones as safe and stable carbene precursors, which circumvents the use of [1.1.1]propellane in the synthesis of the BCPs scaffold. This operationally straightforward method accommodates a wide range of substituted BCB esters and triftosylhydrazones, enabling the synthesis of valuable 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCPs, including those bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary all&#8208;carbon center, in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Selective post&#8208;synthetic transformations of the product BCP esters into other useful small&#8208;ring building blocks, as well as the preparation of the BCP analogue of a drug molecule fragment, demonstrate the versatility and utility of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations, including density functional theory calculations, support a direct, stepwise metal carbene addition into the C&#9472;C bond of the BCB.

         <title>Channel&#8208;Pocket Ultra&#8208;Micropore Configuration in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Simultaneous High Xe Capture and Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a threefold interpenetrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with a channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore configuration. This HOF achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation.








Abstract
Development of energy&#8208;efficient physisorbents for xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation is highly essential to produce high&#8208;purity noble gases and control the pollution of radioactive isotopes. Porous organic materials are very promising for gas separation due to their advantages of low regeneration energy, high moisture resistance, good solution processability and easy regeneration. However, their nonpolar pore surfaces lack strong sorbate&#8211;sorbent interactions, leading to the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between Xe capacity and selectivity that severely delimit their separation efficiency. Herein, we report a strategy of designing channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore configuration in a threefold interpenetrated HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a) for achieving simultaneous high Xe capture and Xe/Kr separation. This channel&#8208;pocket ultra&#8208;micropore structure can provide the size&#8208;matched pore channels and cavities (4.7 and 4.4&#160;&#197;) to offer strong pore confinement for highly selective binding of Xe, and also maximize the usage of pore spaces for high surface area (1113&#160;m2 g&#8722;1) to target large Xe adsorption. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a thus achieves a rare combination of simultaneous high Xe uptake (3.3&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) and record Xe/Kr selectivity (23.5) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, surpassing all the reported porous organic materials. The adsorption binding of Xe and Kr was visualized by gas&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;6a crystal structures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate its exceptional separation capacities for actual Xe/Kr mixtures under ambient conditions, affording the record&#8208;high dynamic selectivity (13.7) among porous organic materials.

         <title>Perspective on Interdisciplinary Approaches on Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 47, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemotaxis is the movement of individual organisms towards or away from a chemical stimulus. This phenomenon is investigated in various disciplines, ranging from biology to physics and even engineering. This perspective aims to summarise recent developments in the field and encourage the unification of terminology to promote interdisciplinary knowledge transfer and collaboration.








Abstract
Most living things on Earth &#8211; from bacteria to humans &#8211; must migrate in some way to find favourable conditions. Therefore, they nearly all use chemotaxis, in which their movement is steered by a gradient of chemicals. Chemotaxis is fundamental to many processes that control our well&#8208;being, including inflammation, neuronal patterning, wound healing, tumour spread in cancer, even embryogenesis. Understanding it is a key goal for biologists. Despite the fact that many basic principles appear to have been conserved throughout evolution, most research has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that control signal processing and locomotion. Cell signaling &#8211; cells responding to time&#8208;varying external signals &#8211; underlies almost all biological processes at the cellular scale. Chemotaxis of single cells provides particularly amenable model systems for quantitative cell signaling studies, even in the presence of noise and fluctuations, because the output, the cell's motility response, is directly observable. However, the different scientific disciplines involved in chemotaxis research rarely overlap, so biologists, physicists and mathematicians interact far too infrequently, methodologies and models differ and commonalities are often overlooked, such as the possible influence of physical or environmental conditions, which has been largely neglected.
