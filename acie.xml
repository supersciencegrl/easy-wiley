      <title>Dynamics of ligand binding to a rigid glycosidase</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8208;domain GH11 glycosidase from&#160;  Bacillus circulans  &#160;(BCX) is involved in the degradation of hemicellulose, one of the most abundant renewable biomaterials in nature. We demonstrate that BCX in solution undergoes minimal structural changes during turnover. NMR spectroscopy results show that the rigid protein matrix provides a frame for fast substrate binding in multiple conformations, accompanied by slow conversion, attributed to an enzyme induced substrate distortion. A model is proposed in which the rigid enzyme takes advantage of substrate flexibility to induce a conformation that facilitates the acyl formation step of the hydrolysis reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoactivated Polymersome Nanomotors: Traversing Biological Barriers</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nanomotors are appealing delivery vehicles for the dynamic transport of functional cargo. Although there are literature examples of such systems, their effective translation toward biological applications is limited due to the use of non&#8208;degradable components. Furthermore, the limitation of size has been an impediment to application due to the importance of achieving nanoscale (ca. 100 nm) dimensions, as opposed to microscale examples that are far more prevalent in the literature. Here, we present a hybrid nanomotor that can be activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;irradiation for the triggered delivery of internal cargo and facilitated transport of external agents to the cell. Utilizing biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) (PEG&#8208;PDLLA) block copolymers, with the two blocks connected via a pH sensitive imine bond, we generate nanoscopic polymersomes that are subsequently modified with a hemispherical gold nanocoat. As a consequence of the Janus morphology, such hybrid polymersomes are capable of undergoing photothermal motility in response to thermal gradients generated by plasmonic absorbance of NIR irradiation, with velocities ranging from 1.9 &#177; 0.25 &#956;m s &#8208;1  to 6.2 &#177; 1.10 &#956;m s &#8208;1  in response to modulating laser power. These biodegradable photothermally&#8208;driven polymersome nanomotors (PNMs) are capable of traversing cellular membranes, allowing the intracellular delivery of molecular and macromolecular cargo, and as such hold great potential for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Acceptor&#8208;doping accelerated charge separation in Cu2O photocathode for photoelectrochemical water splitting: a theoretical and experimental study</title>
      <dc:description>Cu  2  O is a typical photoelectrocatalyst for sustainable hydrogen production, while the fast charge recombination hinders its further development. Herein, Ni  2+  cations have been doped into Cu  2  O lattice (named as Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O) via a simple hydrothermal method and act as electron traps. Theoretical results predict that the Ni dopants produce an acceptor impurity level and lower the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrate that Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O exhibits a photocurrent density of 0.83 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which is 1.34 times higher than that of Cu  2  O. And the photostability has been enhanced by 7.81 times. Moreover, characterizations confirm the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting, facilitated charge separation and transfer, prolonged charge lifetime, and increased carrier concentration of Ni&#8208;Cu  2  O. This work provides a deep insight into how the acceptor&#8208;doping modifies the electronic structure and optimize the PEC process.</dc:description>

      <title>Spin Filtering Along Chiral Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Spin dependent conduction and polarization in chiral polymers were studied, when the polymers are organized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers and the conduction is along the polymer backbone, namely along its longer axis. Large spin polarization and magnetoresistance effects were observed, which showed a clear dependence on the secondary structure of the polymer. The results indicate that the spin polarization process does not include spin flipping and hence it results from backscattering probabilities for the two spin states.</dc:description>

      <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Rhombohedral DNA Crystal Scaffold with Tunable Cavity Sizes and High Resolution Structural Detail</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally designing DNA crystal lattices to scaffold molecular species and solve their structure with X&#8208;ray crystallography is the foundational goal of structural DNA nanotechnology. DNA is an ideal molecule for the construction of 3D crystals with tunable properties due to its high programmability based on canonical Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing, with crystal assembly in all three dimensions facilitated by immobile Holliday junctions and sticky end cohesion. Despite the promise of these systems, only a handful of unique crystal scaffolds have been reported. In this work, we describe a new crystal system with a repeating sequence that mediates the assembly of a 3D scaffold via a series of Holliday junctions linked together with complementary sticky ends. By using an optimized junction sequence, we were able to determine a high resolution (2.7 &#197;) structure containing R3 crystal symmetry, with a slight subsequent improvement (2.6 &#197;) using a modified sticky&#8208;end sequence. The structure is distinct due to a unique immobile Holliday junction sequence, which in turn allowed us to produce crystals that provided a structure with unprecedented atomic detail. Furthermore, we expanded the crystal cavities by 50% by adding an additional helical turn between junctions, and we solved the structure of the resulting lattices to 4.5 &#197; resolution by molecular replacement. These crystals will potentially enable the discrete placement of guest molecules&#8212;such as small molecule catalysts, nanoparticles, or peptides/proteins&#8212;amenable to the cavity size within the scaffold with atomic precision.</dc:description>

      <title>Necroptosis Induced by Ruthenium(II) Complexes as Dual Catalytic Inhibitors of Topoisomerase I/II</title>
      <dc:description>Inducing necroptosis in cancer cells is an effective approach to circumvent drug&#8208;resistance. Metal&#8208;based triggers have, however, rarely been reported. Ruthenium(II) complexes containing 1,1&#8208;(pyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyreno[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazine were developed with a series of different ancillary ligands (  Ru1  &#8208;  7  ). The combination of the main ligand with bipyridyl and phenylpyridyl ligands endows  Ru7  with superior nucleus&#8208;targeting properties. As a rare dual catalytic inhibitor,  Ru7  effectively inhibits the endogenous activities of topoisomerase (topo) I and II and kills cancer cells by necroptosis. The cell signaling pathway from topo inhibition to necroptosis was elucidated. Furthermore,  Ru7  displays significant antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells  in vivo  . To the best of our knowledge,  Ru7  is the first Ru&#8208;based necroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic agent.</dc:description>

Ruthenium(II) complexes containing 1,1&#8208;(pyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyreno[4,5&#8208;e][1,2,4]triazine were developed with a series of different ancillary ligands (  Ru1  &#8208;  7  ). The combination of the main ligand with bipyridyl and phenylpyridyl ligands endows  Ru7  with superior nucleus&#8208;targeting properties. As a rare dual catalytic inhibitor,  Ru7  effectively inhibits the endogenous activities of topoisomerase (topo) I and II and kills cancer cells by necroptosis. The cell signaling pathway from topo inhibition to necroptosis was elucidated. Furthermore,  Ru7  displays significant antitumor activity against drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells  in vivo  . To the best of our knowledge,  Ru7  is the first Ru&#8208;based necroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Alcohols on Heterogeneous Dual Active Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2  to liquid fuels such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, powered by renewable electricity, offers a promising strategy for controlling the global carbon balance and addressing the need for the storage of intermittent renewable energy. In this work, we discovered that the composite composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQ) on CuO&#8208;derived Cu nanorods (NGQ/Cu&#8208;nr) was outstanding electrocatalyst for CO2  reduction to ethanol and n&#8208;propanol. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ alcohols could reach 52.4% with a total current density of 282.1 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2  . This is the highest FE for C2+ alcohol with commercial current density to date. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NGQ/Cu&#8208;nr could provide dual catalytic active sites, and could stabilize the CH2CHO intermediate to enhance the FE of alcohols significantly through further carbon protonation. The NGQ and Cu&#8208;nr had excellent synergistic effect for accelerating the CO2  reduction reaction to alcohols.</dc:description>

      <title>Constructing Charge Transfer Excited State Based on Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Narrowband Green Electroluminescence with High Color Purity and Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of organic materials with narrowband emission feature in longer wavelength region beyond 510 nm remain a great challenge. For constructing narrowband green emitters, we propose a unique molecular design strategy based on frontier molecular orbital engineering (  FMOE  ), which can ingeniously integrate the advantages of twisted donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure and multiple resonance (MR) delayed fluorescence skeleton. By attaching an auxiliary donor to a MR skeleton, a novel molecule with twisted D&#8211;A and MR structure characteristics is formed. Importantly, remarkable red&#8208;shift of emission maximum and narrowband spectrum are simultaneously achieved. The target molecule is employed as emitter to fabricate green organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) with the Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.0%.</dc:description>

      <title>3D hydroxylated MXene/carbon nanotubes composite as scaffold for dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal electrode</title>
      <dc:description>Sodium metal is a promising anode, but the uneven Na deposition with a dendrite growth seriously impedes its application. Herein, a fibrous hydroxylated MXene/carbon nanotubes (h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs) composite is designed as a scaffold for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal electrode. This composite displays fast Na  +  /electron transport kinetics, satisfied thermal conductivity and mechanical property. The h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  contains abundant sodiophilic functional groups, which play a significant role in inducing homogeneous nucleation of Na. Meanwhile, CNTs provide high tensile strength and ease film&#8208;forming. As a result, h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs exhibit a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% and no dendrite after 1000 cycles. The h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs/Na based symmetric cells show a long lifespan over 4000 h at 1.0 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  with a capacity of 1.0 mAh&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Furthermore, Na&#8208;O  2  batteries with h&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  /CNTs/Na anode exhibit a low potential gap of 0.11 V after an initial 70 cycles.

      <title>Flapping Peryleneimide as a Fluorogenic Dye with High Photostability and Strong Visible&#8208;Light Absorption</title>
      <dc:description>Flapping fluorophores (FLAP) with a flexible 8&#960; ring are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile photofunctional system. Here we report a highly photostable &#8220;flapping peryleneimide&#8221; with an unprecedented fluorogenic mechanism based on a bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar conformational change in the S  1  excited state. The S  1  planarization induces an electronic configurational switch, almost quenching an inherent fluorescence (FL) of peryleneimide moieties. However, the FL quantum yield is remarkably improved with a prolonged lifetime by a slight environmental change. This fluorogenic function is realized by sensitive &#960;&#8208;conjugation design, as a more &#960;&#8208;expanded analogue does not show the planarization dynamics. With strong visible&#8208;light absorption, the FL lifetime response synchronized with the flexible flapping motion is useful for the latest optical techniques such as FL lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Monofunctionalization Enabled by Reaction History&#8208;Dependent Communication in Catalytic Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>Selective monofunctionalization of substrates with distant, yet equally&#8208;reactive functional groups is difficult to achieve, as it requires the second functional group to selectively modulate its reactivity once the first functional group has reacted.&#160;We now show that mechanically&#8208;interlocked catalytic rings can effectively regulate the reactivity of stoppering groups in rotaxanes over a distance of ~2&#160;nm.

      <title>In&#8208;situ Spectroscopy of Calcium Fluoride&#8208;anchored Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Thin&#8208;Films during Gas Sorption</title>
      <dc:description>Surface&#8208;mounted Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (SURMOFs) show promising behavior for a manifold of applications. As MOF thin&#8208;films are often unsuitable for conventional characterization techniques, understanding their advantageous properties over their bulk counterparts presents a great analytical challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that MOFs can be grown on calcium fluoride (CaF  2  ) windows after proper functionalization. As CaF  2  &#160;is optically (in the IR&#8208; and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;range of the spectrum) transparent, this allows to study SURMOFs using a conventional spectroscopic tool typically used during catalysis or gas sorption. Hence, we have measured HKUST&#8208;1 during the adsorption of CO and NO. We show that no copper oxide impurities are observed and also confirmed that SURMOFs grown by a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) approach possess Cu  +  &#8208;species in paddlewheel confirmation, but 1.9 times less than in bulk HKUST&#8208;1. The developed methodology paves the way for studying the interaction of any adsorbed gases with thin&#8208;films; not limited to MOFs, low temperature or these specific probe molecules, pushing the boundaries of our current understanding of functional porous materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.

      <title>Facile Preparation of WO3&#8208;x Dots with Remarkably Low Toxicity and Uncompromised Activity as Coreactants for Clinic Electrochemiluminescent Diagnosis</title>
      <dc:description>The exceptional nature of WO3&#8208;x  dots has inspired widespread interests, but it is still a significant challenge to synthesize high&#8208;quality WO3&#8208;x  dots without using unstable reactants, expensive equipment, and complex synthetic processes. Herein, we report the synthesis of ligand&#8208;free WO3&#8208;x  dots that were highly dispersible and rich in oxygen&#8208;vacancies by a simple but straightforward exfoliation of bulk WS2  and a mild follow&#8208;up chemical conversion. Surprisingly, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were emerged as coreactants for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of Ru(bpy)32+  with a comparable ECL efficiency to the well&#8208;known Ru(bpy)32+  /tripropylamine (TPrA) system. Moreover, compared to TPrA, whose toxicity remains a critical issue of concern, the WO3&#8208;x  dots were ~300&#8208;fold lower toxic. The potent of WO3&#8208;x  dots was further explored in a showcase for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with the most competitive limit of detection so far. This work would not only open a new way to synthesize WO3&#8208;x  dots with superior properties but also stimulate an emerging application in clinic ECL diagnosis as coreactants with uncompromised high performance and unprecedented low toxicity.</dc:description>

      <title>Designable Aluminum Molecular Rings: Ring Expansion and Ligand Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>Presented here are the Al(III) molecular ring architectures from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring. Although there are numerous reported cyclic coordination compounds based on transition metals, gallium, or lanthanides, so far the Al molecular are less developed due to the fast hydrolysis nature of Al 3+  ion. In this work, with the assistant of different monohydric alcohol, a series of atomic precisely aluminum molecular rings based on benzoates have been successfully synthesized. The ring expansion of these Al&#8208;rings from 8&#8208;ring to 16&#8208;ring is related to the structure&#8208;directing agents of monohydric alcohols. Moreover, the organic ligands on the Al&#8208;ring can be properly modified by using various benzoate derivatives, which lead to tunable surface properties of these Al&#8208;rings from hydrophilicity to ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity. Importantly, 4&#8208;aminobenzoic acid bridged 16&#8208;ring is soluble in organic solvents and exhibits high solution stability revealed by mass spectroscopy. Ligand substitution also can be performed between these Al&#8208;rings, which reveal controllable ligand functionalization of these Al&#8208;rings. This family of Al&#8208;rings with the ability to be post&#8208;modified therefore can be considered and expected as interesting and potential lego&#8208;like nano&#8208;building units for reticular chemistry. Such a model of organic shell modification without alteration of the inorganic core structure opens a new platform to further tune the chemical&#8208;property and subsequent utilization of these promising Al&#8208;rings. This work not only reveals molecular ring architectures assembled from Al 3+  ions and benzoates but also provides coordination delayed hydrolysis strategy toward the synthesis of crystalline Al(III)&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyolefin&#8211;Based Janus Separator for Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rechargeable sodium battery is a promising technology for low&#8211;cost energy storage. However, the undesirable drawbacks originating from the glass fiber membrane separators have been long overlooked. Herein, we report a versatile &#8220;grafting&#8211;filtrating&#8221; strategy to controllably tune commercial polyolefin separators for sodium batteries. The as&#8211;developed Janus separators contain a single sodium&#8211;ion conducting polymer grafted side and a functional low&#8211;dimensional material coated side. When employed in room&#8211;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries as an example, a poly(1&#8211;[3&#8211;(methacryloyloxy) propylsulfonyl]&#8211;1&#8211;(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8211;imide sodium) grafted side effectively enhances the electrolyte wettability, and inhibits the polysulfide diffusion and sodium dendrite growth. Moreover, a titanium&#8211;deficient nitrogen&#8211;containing MXene coated side electrocatalytically improve the polysulfide conversion kinetics. The as&#8211;developed batteries show high capacity, extended cycling life with lean electrolyte loading.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We disclose the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroacylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with exogenous aldehydes in a domino sequence to forge enantioenriched ketones. The products were obtained in good yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the chiral products served as valuable precursors to access complex spirocyclic scaffolds with three contiguous stereocenters.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Superresolution Imaging using Charge Transfer Dynamics in Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
      <dc:description>In a conjugated polymer based single&#8208;particle heterojunction, stochastic fluctuations of the photogenerated hole population lead to spontaneous fluorescence switching. We found that 405 nm irradiation can induce charge recombination and activate the single&#8208;particle emission. Based on these phenomena, we developed a novel class of semiconducting polymer dots that can operate in two superresolution imaging modes. The spontaneous switching mode offers efficient imaging of large areas, with &lt;10 nm localization precision, while the photoactivation/deactivation mode offers slower imaging, with further improved localization precision (~1 nm), showing advantages in resolving small structures that require high spatial resolution. Superresolution imaging of microtubules and clathrin&#8208;coated pits was demonstrated, under both modes. The excellent localization precision and versatile imaging options provided by these nanoparticles offer clear advantages for imaging of various biological systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective additions of nucleophiles to cyclic carbonates for the preparation of self&#8208;blowing non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams</title>
      <dc:description>Polyurethane (PU) foams are indisputably daily essential materials found in many applications, notably for comfort (e.g. matrasses) or energy saving (e.g. thermal insulation). Today, greener routes for their production are intensively searched for avoiding the use of toxic isocyanates.

These reactions are first validated on model compounds and rationalized by DFT calculations. Various foams are then prepared and characterized in terms of morphology and mechanical properties, and the scope of the process is illustrated by modulating the composition of the reactive formulation. Due to the impressive diversity and accessibility of the main components of the formulations, this new robust and solvent&#8208;free process is opening avenues for constructing more sustainable PU foams, and offers the first realistic alternative to the traditional isocyanate route.</dc:description>

      <title>Illuminating Initial Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation during the Early Stages of Methane Dehydroaromatization</title>
      <dc:description>Still in 2020, methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) is among the most challenging processes in catalysis science due to the inherent harsh reaction conditions and fast catalyst deactivation. To improve it further, understanding the initial C&#8208;C bond formation mechanism is sine qua non. However, consensus about the actual reaction mechanism is still to be achieved. In this work, using advanced magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we study in detail the early stages of the reaction over a well&#8208;dispersed Mo/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst. Simultaneous detection of acetylene (i.e., presumably the direct C&#8208;C bond forming product from methane), methylidene, allenes, acetal and surface&#8208;formate species along with the typical olefinic/aromatic species allow us to conclude the existence of two independent C&#8208;H activation pathways.

A variety of cages can be achieved by applying dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), which are less chemical stable. Here we describe the transformation of a salicylimine cages to a quinoline cage by a twelvefold Povarov reaction as key&#8208;step. Besides the chemical stability of the cage in a broad pH regime, it shows a unique absorption and emission depending on acid concentration. Furthermore, thin films for the vapor detection of acids were investigated, showing color switches from pale yellow to red and characteristic emission profiles.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzymatically&#8208;Formed Peptide Assemblies Sequestrate Proteins and Relocate Inhibitors for Selectively Killing Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show that enzymatic reaction generates peptide assemblies to sequestrate proteins for selectively killing cancer cells.  A phosphopeptide bearing the antagonistic motif (AVPI) to the inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) enters cancer cells and normal cells via caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, respectively. The AVPI&#8208;bearing peptide assemblies in the cytosol sequestrate IAPs and sensitize the cancer cells to bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor, but rescue the normal cells (i.e., HS&#8208;5) by trafficking the BTZ into lysosomes. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) acts as a context&#8208;dependent signal for trafficking the peptide/BTZ assemblies and selectively inducing the death of the cancer cells. The assemblies of AVPI exhibit enhanced proteolytic resistance. This work, being the first example of utilizing the endocytic difference of enzymatically formed peptide assemblies for selective killing cancer cells, promises a new way to develop selective cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Disintegrants: A New Generation of Enzyme Preparation Platforms with Boosted Activity</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance enzyme preparation plays critical roles to realize enzymes&#8217; practical applications. We developed a new generation of enzyme formulation platforms using customized enzyme activators (e.g., metal ions) to directly construct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as protective carriers of the enzymes. More interestingly, these MOF carriers can also serve as the &#8217;disintegrating agents&#8217; that are disintegrable to simultaneously release enzymes and their activators during biocatalysis with boosted activities. For the first time, this highly efficient enzyme preparation platform combines the benefits of enzyme immobilization (enhanced stability, easy operation) and homogeneous biocatalysis (fast diffusion, high activity). Notably, the MOF serves as &#8216;ion pump&#8217; that continuously provides metal ion activators who greatly promote the enzymatic activities (up to 251%). Moreover, this MOF&#8208;enzyme composite demonstrated an excellent protective effect against various perturbation environments. An in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation revealed that the spontaneous activator/enzyme&#8208;releasing and ion&#8208;pumping effects enable enzymes to sufficiently interact with their activators due to the proximity effects and lead to boost of biocatalytic performance, while directly adding activators into enzyme solution leads to much lower activation efficiency. This study opens up the new avenue for high&#8208;performance enzyme preparation, and will significantly promote the broad application of enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Sorting Supramolecular Polymerization into Helical or Lamellar Aggregates of Tetra&#8208;Bay&#8208;Acyloxy Perylene Bisimide</title>
      <dc:description>A new perylene bisimide (PBI) with outstanding fluorescence quantum yield up to unity and its self&#8208;assembly into two polymorphic supramolecular polymers is presented. This newly synthesized PBI bears four solubilizing acyloxy substituents at bay&#8208;position while being unsubstituted at imide position, thereby allowing for hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly in non&#8208;polar solvents. The formation of the polymorphs can be controlled by the cooling rate applied to a hot solution of monomers. They show distinctive absorption profiles and morphologies and can be isolated in different polymorphic liquid&#8208;crystalline states. The interchromophoric arrangement causing the spectral features was elucidated by X&#8208;ray scattering and polarized spectroscopy, revealing the formation of columnar and lamellar phases, respectively, that are formed by either homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly of the atropo&#8208;enantiomeric PBI building block. Kinetic studies reveal that a narcissistic self&#8208;sorting process prevails upon fast cooling and that the transformation into heterochiral (racemic) sheet&#8208;like self&#8208;assemblies proceeds by dissociation via the monomeric state.</dc:description>

In detail, the nitrogen&#8208;rich salt guanidinium 5,5&#8217;&#8208;azotetrazolate (GZT), which is usually applied as gas generator or propellant ingredient, was combined with different smoke dyes (Solvent Red 1, Solvent Violet 47, Solvent Green 3, Solvent Yellow 33).

The author&#8217;s determined common smoke characteristics with respect to burn time / burn rate, yield factor, transfer rate as well as energetic properties and compared them with classic chlorate&#8208;based in&#8208;use formulations. To the best of our knowledge, nothing comparable is known in the literature.

      <dc:description>Miniaturized lasers with high spectral purity and wide wavelength tunability  are crucial for various photonic  applications. Here we propose a strategy to realize broadband tunable single&#8208;mode lasing based on photoisomerization activated intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) process in coupled polymer microdisk cavities. The photoisomerizable  molecules doped in the polymer microdisks can be quantitatively transformed into a kind of laser dyes with strong ICT characters by photoexcitation. The gain region was tailored over a wide range through the self&#8208;modulation of the optically activated ICT isomers. Meanwhile, the resonant modes shifted with the photoisomerization due to an effective refractive index change of the polymer microdisk cavity. Based on the synergetic modulation of optical gain and microcavity, we realized the broadband tuning of the single&#8208;mode laser.

      <title>Universal Strategy for Improving the Sensitivity of Detecting Volatile Organic Compounds by Patterned Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>The diffusion of target analytes is a determined factor for the sensitivity of a given gas sensor.

      <dc:description>Developing graphene&#8208;like two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials naturally possessing a bandgap has sparked enormous interest.

Besides the precise control in sophisticated on&#8208;surface synthesis, this work proposes a single atomic&#8208;layer organic semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3.41 eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Formation and structure of fluorescent silver nanoclusters at interfacial binding sites facilitating oligomerization of DNA hairpins</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent, DNA&#8208;stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA&#8208;AgNCs) are applied in a range of applications within nanoscience and nanotechnology.

      <title>Surface Capping Agents and Their Roles in Shape&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A pivotal role in directing the growth of colloidal metal nanocrystals into diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes is played by surface capping agents. This article offers a comprehensive review of capping agents as well as their use in engineering the surface structures and catalytic properties of metal nanocrystals.







Abstract
Surface capping agents have been extensively used to control the evolution of seeds into nanocrystals with diverse but well&#8208;controlled shapes. Here we offer a comprehensive review of these agents, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of their roles in guiding the shape evolution of metal nanocrystals. We begin with a brief introduction to the early history of capping agents in electroplating and bulk crystal growth, followed by discussion of how they affect the thermodynamics and kinetics involved in a synthesis of metal nanocrystals. We then present representative examples to highlight the various capping agents, including their binding selectivity, molecular&#8208;level interaction with a metal surface, and impacts on the growth of metal nanocrystals. We also showcase progress in leveraging capping agents to generate nanocrystals with complex structures and/or enhance their catalytic properties. Finally, we discuss various strategies for the exchange or removal of capping agents, together with perspectives on future directions.

      <title>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Nanozyme with Both Accelerated and Inhibited Biocatalytic Activities Capable of Accessing Drug&#8208;Drug Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Emerged as a cost&#8208;effective and robust enzyme mimic, nanozymes have drawn increasing attention with broad applications ranging from cancer therapy to biosensing. Developing nanozymes with both accelerated and inhibited biocatalytic properties in a biological context is intriguing to peruse more advanced functions of natural enzymes, but remains challenging, because most nanozymes are lack of enzyme&#8208;like molecular structures. By re&#8208;visiting and engineering the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst that has a heme&#8208;like Fe&#8208;N  x  active sites, herein, we report that Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C could not only catalyze drug metabolization but also had inhibition behaviors similar to cytochrome P450 (CYP), endowing it a potential replacement of CYP for preliminary evaluation of massive potential chemicals, drug dosing guide and outcome prediction. In addition, different to the electrocatalysts, the highly graphitic framework of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C may not be obligatory for a competitive CYP&#8208;like activity. Beyond merely boosting the activity, this work would open a new vista of nanozymes with inhibited behavior for keeping up more demanding applications, enabled by further mimicking the molecular structure of enzymes.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerged as a cost&#8208;effective and robust enzyme mimic, nanozymes have drawn increasing attention with broad applications ranging from cancer therapy to biosensing. Developing nanozymes with both accelerated and inhibited biocatalytic properties in a biological context is intriguing to peruse more advanced functions of natural enzymes, but remains challenging, because most nanozymes are lack of enzyme&#8208;like molecular structures. By re&#8208;visiting and engineering the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst that has a heme&#8208;like Fe&#8208;N  x  active sites, herein, we report that Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C could not only catalyze drug metabolization but also had inhibition behaviors similar to cytochrome P450 (CYP), endowing it a potential replacement of CYP for preliminary evaluation of massive potential chemicals, drug dosing guide and outcome prediction. In addition, different to the electrocatalysts, the highly graphitic framework of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C may not be obligatory for a competitive CYP&#8208;like activity. Beyond merely boosting the activity, this work would open a new vista of nanozymes with inhibited behavior for keeping up more demanding applications, enabled by further mimicking the molecular structure of enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Pd&#8208;Senphos Catalyzed trans&#8208;Selective Cyanoboration of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
      <dc:description>The first trans&#8208;selective cyanoboration reaction of an alkyne, specifically a 1,3&#8208;enyne, is described. The reported palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyanoboration of 1,3&#8208;enynes is site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselective, and is uniquely enabled by the 1,4&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based Senphos ligand structure. Tetra&#8208;substituted alkenyl nitriles are obtained providing useful boron&#8208;dienenitrile building blocks that can be further functionalized.

      <title>Mutant&#8208;Selective Allosteric EGFR Degraders are Effective Against a Broad Range of Drug&#8208;Resistant Mutations</title>
      <dc:description>Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through an allosteric mechanism provides a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug&#8208;resistant EGFR mutations that emerge within the ATP binding site. Here, we develop an allosteric EGFR degrader, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163, which can selectively inhibit the proliferation of L858R/T790 (L/T) mutant Ba/F3 cells while leaving wildtype EGFR Ba/F3 cells unaffected. DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is also effective against osimertinib&#8208;resistant cells with L/T/C797S and L/T/L718Q EGFR mutations. When combined with an ATP&#8208;site EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, the anti&#8208;proliferative activity of DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 against L858R/T790M EGFR&#8208;Ba/F3 cells is enhanced. Collectively, DDC&#8208;01&#8208;163 is a promising allosteric EGFR degrader with selective activity against various clinically relevant EGFR mutants as a single agent and when combined with an ATP&#8208;site inhibitor. Our data suggests that targeted protein degradation is a promising drug development approach for mutant EGFR.</dc:description>

      <title>Excimer and Exciplex Formation in Gold(I) Complexes Preconditioned by Aurophilic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Bond formation through excitation: Linear, two&#8208;coordinate gold(I) complexes are known to aggregate side&#8208;on through aurophilic interactions. The resulting weak Au&#8211;Au contacts are strengthened upon UV irradiation as evidenced by a shortening of the intermetallic distance and the vibrational and electronic absorption and emission characteristics of the resulting excimers. The changes in the redox potentials make [AuI&#8722;AuI]* excimers useful intermediates in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Excimers and exciplexes are defined as assemblies of atoms or molecules A/A&#8242; where interatomic/intermolecular bonding appears only in excited states such as [A2]* (for excimers) and [AA&#8242;]* (for exciplexes). Their formation has become widely known because of their role in gas&#8208;phase laser technologies, but their significance in general chemistry terms has been given little attention. Recent investigations in gold chemistry have opened up a new field of excimer and exciplex chemistry that relies largely on the preorganization of gold(I) compounds (electronic configuration AuI(5d10)) through aurophilic contacts. In the corresponding excimers, a new type of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au bonding arises, with bond energies and lengths approaching those of ground&#8208;state Au&#8722;Au bonds between metal atoms in the Au0(5d106s1) and AuII(5d9) configurations. Excimer formation gives rise to a broad range of photophysical effects, for which some of the relaxation dynamics have recently been clarified. Excimers have also been shown to play an important role in photoredox binuclear gold catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bond formation through excitation &lt;/b&gt;: Linear, two&#8208;coordinate gold(I) complexes are known to aggregate side&#8208;on through aurophilic interactions. The resulting weak Au&#8211;Au contacts are strengthened upon UV irradiation as evidenced by a shortening of the intermetallic distance and the vibrational and electronic absorption and emission characteristics of the resulting excimers. The changes in the redox potentials make [Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;]* excimers useful intermediates in photoredox catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excimers and exciplexes are defined as assemblies of atoms or molecules &lt;b&gt;A &lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;A &lt;/b&gt;&#8242; where interatomic/intermolecular bonding appears only in excited states such as [&lt;b&gt;A &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]* (for excimers) and [&lt;b&gt;AA &lt;/b&gt;&#8242;]* (for exciplexes). Their formation has become widely known because of their role in gas&#8208;phase laser technologies, but their significance in general chemistry terms has been given little attention. Recent investigations in gold chemistry have opened up a new field of excimer and exciplex chemistry that relies largely on the preorganization of gold(I) compounds (electronic configuration Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;(5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;)) through aurophilic contacts. In the corresponding excimers, a new type of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au bonding arises, with bond energies and lengths approaching those of ground&#8208;state Au&#8722;Au bonds between metal atoms in the Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Au&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(5d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) configurations. Excimer formation gives rise to a broad range of photophysical effects, for which some of the relaxation dynamics have recently been clarified. Excimers have also been shown to play an important role in photoredox binuclear gold catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;I: Progress</title>
      <dc:description>
The contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences is discussed in this two&#8208;part Review. This first part describes how discoveries of physical matter, processes, and models are unified as search problems; what to consider when assessing the extent of autonomy in a discovery; and many examples of discoveries in synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this first part, we describe a classification for discoveries of physical matter (molecules, materials, devices), processes, and models and how they are unified as search problems. We then introduce a set of questions and considerations relevant to assessing the extent of autonomy. Finally, we describe many case studies of discoveries accelerated by or resulting from computer assistance and automation from the domains of synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science. These illustrate how rapid advancements in hardware automation and machine learning continue to transform the nature of experimentation and modeling. Part two reflects on these case studies and identifies a set of open challenges for the field.
