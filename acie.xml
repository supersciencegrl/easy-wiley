      <title>Polymerized Small Molecule Acceptors for High Performance All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), with  n  &#8208;type conjugated polymer (  n  &#8208;CP) as acceptor instead of fullerene derivative or lately developed small molecule acceptors (SMAs), have drawn tremendous research interests in recent years, due to their inherent advantages of good film&#8208;forming property, morphology stability and mechanical flexibility. Thus numerous  n  &#8208;CPs have been developed, among them, a naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer N2200 is the most representative and most widely used  n  &#8208;CP acceptor. Device engineering with N2200, have driven the power conversion efficiencies of all&#8208;PSCs exceeding 11%, comparable to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fullerene&#8208;based PSCs. However, its low absorption coefficient in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region limits its photovoltaic efficiency to be further increased. In 2017, we proposed a strategy of polymerizing SMAs to construct new generation polymer acceptors with SMA as the key building block. The polymerized SMAs (PSMAs) possess low bandgap and strong absorption in the NIR region benefitted from the SMAs. Recently, these PSMAs have received increasing attention and the PCE of the  all  &#8208;PSC with Y6&#8208;based PSMA as acceptor reached the high level of over 12%~14%. This perspective aims to explain the design strategies of the molecular structure of PSMAs and to introduce the recent research progress of the PSMAs.

      <title>Continuous Tuning of the Au&#8208;Cu2O Janus Nanostructures for Efficient Charge Separation</title>
      <dc:description>In photocatalysis, the Schottky barrier in metal&#8208;semiconductor hybrids is known to promote charge separation, but a core&#8208;shell structure always leads to charge build&#8208;up and eventually shuts off the photocurrent. Here, we show that the Au&#8208;Cu2O hybrid nanostructures could be continuously tuned, particularly when the Cu2O domains are single&#8208;crystalline. It is in contrast to the conventional systems where the hybrid configuration is mainly determined by the choice of materials. The distal separation of the Au&#8208;Cu2O domains in Janus nanostructures leads to enhanced charge separation and great improvement of the photocurrent. The activity of the Au&#8208;Cu2O Janus structures is 5 times higher than the core&#8208;shell structure, and 10 times higher than the neat Cu2O nanocubes. The continuous structural tuning allows study of the structure&#8208;property relationship, and optimization of the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Anion solvation reconfiguration enables high&#8208;voltage carbonate electrolytes for stable Zn/graphite cells</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional carbonate solvents with low HOMO levels are theoretically compatible with the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;voltage Zn/graphite battery chemistry. However, the anion nucleophilic attack on carbonates induces the oxidative breakdown at high potentials. Here, we restore the inherent anodic stability of carbonate electrolytes by designing a micro&#8208;heterogeneous anion solvation network. Based on the addition of a strongly electron&#8208;donating trimethyl phosphate (TMP) solvent, the oxidation&#8208;vulnerable anion&#8208;carbonate affinities are decoupled because of the preferential sequestration of anions into TMP solvating domains around metal cations. The hybridized electrolytes elevate the electrochemical window of carbonate electrolytes by 0.45 V and enable the operation of 2.80 V Zn/graphite dual&#8208;ion cells with a long cycle life (92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). By inheriting the non&#8208;&#64258;ammability from TMP and high ion&#8208;transport kinetics from carbonate systems, this facile strategy provides cells with additional benefits of &#64257;re retardancy and high&#8208;power capability.</dc:description>

      <title>A two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic polymer enabled by robust nickel&#8208;nitrogen and hydrogen bonds for exceptional sodium&#8208;ion storage</title>
      <dc:description>Organic electrode materials are suffering from the low electronic conductivity and poor structure stability. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic polymer, Ni coordinated tetramino&#8208;benzoquinone (Ni&#8208;TABQ), is synthesized via  d&#8208;&#960;  hybridization, the polymer chains of which are stitched by hydrogen bonds to feature as a robust two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered structure. It offers both electron conduction and Na  +  diffusion pathways along the directions of the polymer chains and the hydrogen bonds. With both the conjugated benzoid carbonyls and imines as the redox centers for the insertion and extraction of Na  +  , the Ni&#8208;TABQ delivers high capacities of ~469.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and 345.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 8 A g  &#8208;1  . The large capacities are sustained for 100 cycles with almost 100% coulombic efficiencies. The exceptional electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique 2D electron conduction and Na  +  diffusion pathways enabled by the robust Ni&#8208;N and hydrogen bonds. This investigation will shed lights into the molecular design and the electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

The exceptional electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique 2D electron conduction and Na  +  diffusion pathways enabled by the robust Ni&#8208;N and hydrogen bonds. This investigation will shed lights into the molecular design and the electrochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Selective Olefin Production from CO2 Hydrogenation on Iron Catalysts: A Subtle Synergy between Manganese and Sodium Additives</title>
      <dc:description>Mn and Na additives have been widely studied for improving the efficiency of CO  2  hydrogenation to valuable olefins on Fe catalysts, but their effects on the catalytic properties and mechanism are still under vigorous debate. This study shows that Fe&#8208;based catalysts with moderate Mn and Na contents are highly selective for CO  2  hydrogenation to olefins, together with low selectivities both to CO and CH  4  and much improved space&#8208;time olefin yields compared to those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Combined kinetic assessment and quasi in&#8208;situ characterizations further unveil the sole presence of Mn suppresses the activity of Fe catalysts due to the close contact between Fe and Mn, while the extra introduction of Na mediates the Fe&#8208;Mn interaction and brings strong basic sites. This subtle synergy between Na and Mn sheds light on the importance of the interplay of multiple additives that would bring an enabling strategy to improve catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Exotic compositional ordering in Mn&#8208;Ni&#8208;As intermetallics</title>
      <dc:description>In this work we benefited from recent advances in tools for crystal structure analysis that enabled us to describe an exotic nanoscale phenomenon in structural chemistry. The Mn0.60Ni0.40As sample of the Mn1&#8208;xNixAs solid solution, exhibits an incommensurate compositional modulation intimately coupled with positional modulations. The average structure is of the simple NiAs type, but in contrast to a normal solid solution, we observe that manganese and nickel segregate periodically at the nano&#8208;level into ordered MnAs and NiAs layers with thickness of 2&#8208;4 face&#8208;shared octahedra. The detailed description was obtained by combination of 3D electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction. The distribution of the manganese and nickel layers is perfectly described by a modulation vector q = 0.360(3) c*. Displacive modulations are observed for all elements as a consequence of the occupational modulation, and as a means to achieve acceptable Ni&#8208;As and Mn&#8208;As distances. This extraordinary modulated evolution of magnetic MnAs and non&#8208;magnetic NiAs&#8208;layers with periodicity at ~10&#160;&#197; level, may provide an avenue for spintronics.</dc:description>

By optimizing component domains, the phonon coupling strength can be reduced by a factor of 2 driven by the delocalization of 2D excitons in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientations. It shows the picosecond energy transfer originated from the F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiently competes with the exciton&#8208;phonon interactions in the binary system. Explicit deciphering of the relationship between phonon interactions and energy transfer, and successful modulations of the phonon interactions in the binary system provide significant implications for developing high&#8208;performance excitonic optoelectronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Gas&#8208;Constructed Vesicles with Gas&#8208;Moldable Membrane Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooking with gas: CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pair monomers can polymerize to form vesicles. Changing the gas used results in the formation of vesicles with distinct components, architectures, and morphologies. This introduces the use of gases to form nanomaterials and could be used to recycle industrial waste gases.







Abstract
Integrating gas as a main building block into nanomaterial construction is a challenging mission that remains elusive. Herein, we report a gas&#8208;constructed vesicular system formed by CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Two molecular triads bearing three bulky borane and phosphine groups are designed as trivalent disc&#8208;like FLP monomers. CO2, as a gas cross&#8208;linker, can drive the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization of these two FLP monomers, leading to the generation of planar FLP networks that further transform into a thermodynamically favored membranous vesicle structure. Gas&#8208;guided vesicle formation is also applicable to other inert but FLP&#8208;activatable gases. Different gas linkages can form vesicles with distinct architectures, sizes, and morphologies. We envisage that this study would suggest a new concept that exploits gases to fabricate tunable nanomaterials.

      <title>Anisotropic protein organofibers encoded with extraordinary mechanical behaviors for cellular mechanobiology applications</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogels particularly those integrated with living cellular systems, show active properties for diverse applications due to their dynamic networks, structural flexibility, and tailorable functionalities. However, their mechanical performances are limited especially in the context of cellular mechanobiology. Besides, it remains elusive to fabricate robust gel networks with a long&#8208;term durability. Thus, it is highly desirable to design new generation of soft materials showing outstanding mechanical behaviors for mechanobiology applications. Here, we harnessed synthetic biology strategy and supramolecular assembly rationale to prepare a family of elastin&#8208;like protein (ELP) organogel fibers with extraordinary mechanical properties. Mechanical performance and stability of the assembled anisotropic proteins are significantly superior to other organo&#8208;/hydro&#8208;gel systems. Remarkably, bone&#8208;derived mesenchymal cells for the first time were introduced in the organofiber system for stem cell lineage differentiation. Thus, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of mechanically strong and anisotropic organo&#8208;networks for mechanobiology applications and holds great potentials for tissue regeneration translations.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels particularly those integrated with living cellular systems, show active properties for diverse applications due to their dynamic networks, structural flexibility, and tailorable functionalities. However, their mechanical performances are limited especially in the context of cellular mechanobiology. Besides, it remains elusive to fabricate robust gel networks with a long&#8208;term durability. Thus, it is highly desirable to design new generation of soft materials showing outstanding mechanical behaviors for mechanobiology applications. Here, we harnessed synthetic biology strategy and supramolecular assembly rationale to prepare a family of elastin&#8208;like protein (ELP) organogel fibers with extraordinary mechanical properties. Mechanical performance and stability of the assembled anisotropic proteins are significantly superior to other organo&#8208;/hydro&#8208;gel systems. Remarkably, bone&#8208;derived mesenchymal cells for the first time were introduced in the organofiber system for stem cell lineage differentiation. Thus, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of mechanically strong and anisotropic organo&#8208;networks for mechanobiology applications and holds great potentials for tissue regeneration translations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fluorescence Quenching Effects of Tetrazines and Their Diels&#8208;Alder Products: Mechanistic Insight Toward Fluorogenic Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iedDA) reactions between  s  &#8208;tetrazines and strained dienophiles have numerous applications in chemical biology and materials science. Tetrazines most often quench the emission of pendant fluorophores. This effect, however, is diminished upon iedDA, leading to the formation of emissive products with important applications in fluorescence labelling of biomolecules. Herein we investigate the effect of the dienophile on the fluorescence enhancement obtained upon reaction with a tetrazine&#8208;quenched fluorophore and study the possible mechanisms of fluorescence quenching by both the tetrazine and its reaction products through a combination of linear and ultrabroadband two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) experiments. The dihydropyridazine product obtained from reaction of the tetrazine with a strained cyclooctene shows a residual fluorescence quenching effect, greater than that exerted by the pyridazine arising from reaction of the tetrazine with the analogous alkyne. Ultrabroadband 2D ES measurements reveal that resonance energy transfer is the mechanism responsible for the fluorescence quenching effect of tetrazines, whereas a mechanism involving more intimate electronic coupling, most likely photoinduced electron transfer, is responsible for the quenching effect of the dihydropyridazine. These studies uncover parameters that can be tuned to maximize fluorogenic efficiency in bioconjugation reactions and they reveal that strained alkenes, though optimal for fast kinetics, are not the best reaction partners for achieving maximum contrast ratio in fluorescence labeling.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications, whereas new 2D candidates targeted at solar&#8208;blind UV range remain extremely scarce. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics that combine polarization and semiconducting properties have taken a booming position within this portfolio. Here, using the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D dimensional reduction of CH3NH3PbCl3, we successfully designed a multilayered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (CH3CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Cl10  , which shows notable spontaneous polarization and a high Curie temperature (390 K) comparable with that of BaTiO3  (393 K). Strikingly, the wide bandgap (~3.35 eV) and anisotropic absorbance stemming from its intrinsic 2D motif, greatly favor its polarization&#8208;sensitive activity in UV region. Consequently, the device displays excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive behaviours under 266 nm, along with a large dichroic ratio (~1.38) and high on/off current ratio (~2.3*103  ).

      <title>A Genetically Encoded RNA Photosensitizer for Targeted Cell Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>Genetically encoded RNA devices have emerged for various cellular applications in imaging and bio&#8208;sensing, but their functions as precise regulators in living systems are still limited. Inspired by protein photosensitizers, we propose here a  G  enetically encoded  R  NA  A  ptamer&#8208;based  P  hotosensitizer (GRAP). Upon illumination, the RNA photosensitizer can controllably generate reactive oxygen species for targeted cell regulation. The GRAP system can be selectively activated by endogenous stimuli and light of different wavelengths. Compared with their protein analogs, GRAP is highly programmable and exhibit reduced off&#8208;target effect. Our results indicate that GRAP enables efficient noninvasive target cell ablation with high temporal and spatial precision. We believe this new RNA regulator system will be widely used for optogenetics, targeted cell ablation, subcellular manipulation, and advanced imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photo&#8208;Switched MicroRNA Amplifier for Precise Photodynamic Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a hot topic in precise medicine. However the low abundance of responsive trigger molecules in early&#8208;stage diseases limits its application. Here we designed an amplifier with multiple upconversion luminances to achieve near&#8208;infrared photo&#8208;switched cascade reaction triggered by specific microRNA and precise PDT of early&#8208;stage cancers. This amplifier was composed of photo&#8208;caged DNA nanocombs and an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) sensitized with IRDye&#174; 800CW. The nanocomb was prepared by assembling a &#8220;photozipper&#8221;&#8208;protected hairpin and two kinds of hybridizable hairpin probes on a DNA skeleton. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, the produced UV light cleaved off the &#8220;photozipper&#8221; to induce microRNA&#8208;responsive cascade hybridization reaction, which activated the photosensitizers linked to different hairpins to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the simultaneously emitted blue light for efficient PDT. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the high amplification efficiency and promising application of the photo&#8208;switched amplifier in early&#8208;stage cancer treatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Cocrystal prediction by artificial neural networks</title>
      <dc:description>A significant amount of attention has been given to the design and synthesis of cocrystals by both industry and academia because of its potential to change a molecule&#8217;s physicochemical properties. Yet, difficulties arise when searching for adequate combinations of molecules (or coformers) to form cocrystals, hampering the efficient exploration of the target&#8217;s solid&#8208;state landscape.

      <title>Engineering Corona Structure on Gold Nanoclusters for Gastrointestinal Imaging by Red&#8208;shifted Emissions in the Second Near&#8208;infrared Window</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescence emissions in the second near infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have shown extraordinary advantages for bio&#8208;imaging. However, it&#8217;s a big challenge to exploit NIR&#8208;II emitters for gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging due to fluorescence quenching in digestive microenvironment. Herein, we made an interesting finding that red&#8208;shifted emissions of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) into NIR&#8208;II region with improved quantum yields (QY) could be achieved by engineering a corona structure of a ribonuclease&#8208;A (RNase&#8208;A) on particle surfaces. RNase&#8208;A encapsulated AuNCs (RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs) displayed emissions at 1050 nm with a 1.9% QY. Compare to rare earth and silver based NIR&#8208;II emitters, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs had excellent biocompatibility, showed &gt;50&#8208;fold higher sensitivity in GI tract, and homogeneously migrated during gastrointestinal peristalsis to allow visualization of the detailed structures of GI tract. Notably, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs could be exploited to successfully differentiate intestinal tumor mice from the healthy, indicating a potential utility for early diagnosis of intestinal tumors in clinics.</dc:description>

      <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Nitrogen Fixation Catalyzed by Stable Radical&#8208;Containing MOFs: Improved Efficiency Induced by a Structural Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we present a new viologen&#8208;based radical&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (RMOF) Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7, which upon heating in air undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to generate Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8. Both RMOFs exhibit excellent air and water stability as a result of favorable radical&#8208;radical interactions, and their long&#8208;lifetime radicals result in wide spectral absorption in the range 200&#8208;2500 nm.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we present a new viologen&#8208;based radical&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (RMOF) Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7, which upon heating in air undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to generate Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8. Both RMOFs exhibit excellent air and water stability as a result of favorable radical&#8208;radical interactions, and their long&#8208;lifetime radicals result in wide spectral absorption in the range 200&#8208;2500 nm. Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7 and Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8 show excellent activity toward solar&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation, with ammonia production rates of 128 and 220 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , respectively.

      <dc:description>The design, synthesis, and characterization of two novel nonfullerene acceptors (M8 and M34) based on ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacenes with different heterocycles are reported. Replacing the furan heterocycles with the thiophene heterocycles in the heteroheptacene backbone leads to hypsochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport for the resulting nonfullerene acceptor (M34) although the &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking distances are barely affected. Bulk&#8208;heterojunction polymer solar cells fabricated from M34 and a wide bandgap polymer (PM6) as the donor showed a best power conversion ef&#64257;ciency (PCE) of 15.24% with an open circuit voltage (  V  OC  ) of 0.91 V, much higher than a PCE of 4.21% and a  V  OC  of 0.83 V for the counterparts based on M8:PM6.

      <title>Activating Versatile&#160;Mechanoluminescence in Organic Host&#8208;Guest Crystals by Controlling Exciton Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials are attracting increasing interest due to its promising applications in various areas. However, to date, it remains a major challenge to develop a precise and universal route to achieving organic ML materials. Herein, we report the first example that ML can be easily realized in organic piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals, under the conditions that neither the host nor the guest is ML&#8208;active. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that, excitons of the host generated by piezoelectricity can be harvested effectively by the guest for light emission, due to the restraint of intersystem crossing process. Moreover, different host&#8208;guest crystals are constructed, wherein the emission colour, intensity, colour purity and emission duration of ML can be manipulated. This work deepens our understanding of organic ML generation in piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals and provides an inspiring principle to design more organic ML materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing the Magnesium Storage Mechanism in Mesoporous Bismuth via Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Bismuth is a promising alternative to magnesium metal anode.

      <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials, featuring an energy upconversion from triplet to singlet states, are anticipated to overcome triplet&#8208;related losses towards electrically driven organic lasers. Thus far, contributions from triplets to lasing have not yet been experimentally convinced, which should be ascribed to the difficulties in constructing devices with both high triplet&#8208;harvesting ability and strong cavity effect.

In these materials, triplets are continuously converted to radiative singlets through RISC, giving rise to reduced losses in stimulated emission. The involvement of regenerated singlets in population inversion results in a thermally activated lasing; that is, the lasing intensity increases with increasing temperature, accompanied by accelerated depletion of the excited&#8208;state population. Benefiting from the suppression of triplet accumulations by RISC processes, a high&#8208;repetition&#8208;rate microlaser was achieved.

      <title>High&#8208;Density and Thermally Stable Palladium Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Chemoselective Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have shown superior activity and/or selectivity for many energy&#8208; and environment&#8208;related reactions, but their stability at high site density and under reducing atmosphere remains unresolved. Herein, we elucidate the intrinsic driving force of palladium single atom with high site density (up to 5 wt%) under reducing atmosphere, and its unique catalytic performance for hydrogenation reactions.  In&#8208;situ  experiments (including scanning transmission electron microscopy, near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and quasi in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray adsorption) and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms tend to migrate into the surface vacancy&#8208;enriched molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process by transferring oxide crystals to carbide crystals, leading to the surface enrichment of atomic Pd instead of formation of particles. The Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent selectivity for both liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics (&gt; 99%) and gas&#8208;phase hydrogenation of CO  2  to CO (&gt; 98%), which is far superior to their nanoparticles analogues. More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have shown superior activity and/or selectivity for many energy&#8208; and environment&#8208;related reactions, but their stability at high site density and under reducing atmosphere remains unresolved. Herein, we elucidate the intrinsic driving force of palladium single atom with high site density (up to 5 wt%) under reducing atmosphere, and its unique catalytic performance for hydrogenation reactions.  In&#8208;situ  experiments (including scanning transmission electron microscopy, near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and quasi in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray adsorption) and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms tend to migrate into the surface vacancy&#8208;enriched molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process by transferring oxide crystals to carbide crystals, leading to the surface enrichment of atomic Pd instead of formation of particles. The Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent selectivity for both liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics (&amp;gt; 99%) and gas&#8208;phase hydrogenation of CO  2  to CO (&amp;gt; 98%), which is far superior to their nanoparticles analogues. More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles above MW 1000: Backbone rigidity vs. side&#8208;chain lipophilicity</title>
      <dc:description>Large, macrocyclic peptides can achieve surprisingly high membrane permeability, although the properties that govern permeability in this chemical space are only beginning to come into focus. We generated two libraries of cyclic decapeptides with stable, cross&#8208; b conformations, and found that peptoid substitutions within the b &#8208;turns of the macrocycle preserved the rigidity of the parent scaffold, whereas peptoid substitutions in the opposing b &#8208;strands led to &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; species that were rigid in nonpolar media but highly flexible in water. Both rigid and chameleonic compounds showed high permeability over a wide lipophilicity range, with peak permeabilities differing significantly depending on scaffold rigidity. Our findings indicate that modulating lipophilicity can be used to engineer favorable ADME properties into both rigid and flexible macrocyclic peptides, and that scaffold rigidity can be used to tune optimal lipophilicity.</dc:description>

Herein, we present the successful doping of copper(I) into 0D Cs  2  ZnBr  4  .

Detailed spectral characterizations including ultrafast transient absorption (TA) techniques were carried out to investigate the effect of Cu  +  dopants and the origin of blue emission in Cs  2  ZnBr  4  :Cu. To further study the role of A&#8208;site cation and halogen, A  2  ZnCl  4  :Cu (A= Cs, Rb) are also synthesized and found to generate intense sky&#8208;blue emission (PLQY ~73.1%).

      <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Hydrocyanation of Nonconjugated Dienes</title>
      <dc:description>The&#160;metal&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reaction has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to functionalize remote positions in organic molecules. However, a chain&#8208;walking protocol for nonconjugated dienes remains scarcely reported and his development is currently ongoing. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of nonconjugated dienes involving the chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and a wide range of substrates were tolerated, delivering the products in high yields and enantioselectivities.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The&#160;metal&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reaction has recently emerged as a powerful strategy to functionalize remote positions in organic molecules. However, a chain&#8208;walking protocol for nonconjugated dienes remains scarcely reported and his development is currently ongoing. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of nonconjugated dienes involving the chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, and a wide range of substrates were tolerated, delivering the products in high yields and enantioselectivities. Deuterium labeling experiments support the chain&#8208;walking process which involves an iterative &#946;&#8208;H elimination and reinsertion processes. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis, regioconvergent experiments, and downstream transformations gave further insights into the high potential of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The ability to incorporate functional metal ions (M  n+  ) into metal&#8208;organic coordination complexes adds remarkable flexibility in the synthesis of multifunctional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with tailorable electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.

      <title>LaOCl&#8208;coupled polymeric carbon nitride for overall water splitting through a  one&#8208;photon excitation pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Sun&#8208;light driven water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases in a large scale is a promising method for solar energy conversion. However, it is still a challenge to explore photocatalytic materials for overall water splitting due to the limited choice of a single semiconductor with suitable band energy levels (matching with water redox splitting potentials) while with minimized band gap for light harvesting. Here, we report a one&#8208;photon excitation pathway by coupling polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with LaOCl semiconductor to achieve overall water splitting. This artificial photosynthesis composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2, with evolution rates of 22.3 and 10.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1, respectively, outperforming most of the PCN&#8208;based materials. The high photocatalytic performance of PCN/LaOCl can be ascribed to the simultaneously accomplished reduction and oxidation of water on LaOCl and PCN domains, respectively, as well as the fast charge separation and migration induced by the interfacial electric field related to LaOCl modification. This study provides new insights on the development &#160;of composite photocatalysts for pure water splitting on the basis of polymer&#8208;based materials via charge modulation.</dc:description>

The wavelength, brightness, and stability are three crucial factors that determine the performance of a NIR&#8208;II fluorophore. Up to now, significant progress has been made in the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence molecular probes, including the synthesis of D&#8208;A&#8208;D and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores with improved NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging performance and the construction of the off&#8208;on probe and ratiometric probe via energy transfer or molecular structure modification. In this Review, we summarize the most recent advances in molecular engineering design strategies of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and probes, then highlight a selection of bioimaging and biosensing applications. We also provide perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiospecific solid solution formation triggers the propagation of homochirality</title>
      <dc:description>Propagation of homochirality plays a crucial role in the discussion on the origin of life. We here investigate the role of structurally related enantiopure additives in chiral symmetry breaking during reactive crystallizations. We demonstrate that a symmetry breaking process can be driven towards the same absolute configuration as the additive if this additive forms an enantiospecific solid solution with the racemate. We observe two antagonistic processes: enantiospecific growth inhibition directs symmetry breaking to the opposite enantiomer following &#8220;the rule of reversal&#8221; and enantiospecific solid solution formation that favors homochiral outcomes. During continuous grinding, contributions of solid solution formation override contributions of enantiospecific growth inhibition, directing the process towards the absolute configuration of the additive. Collectively, our findings offer a potential mechanism for propagation of homochirality.</dc:description>
