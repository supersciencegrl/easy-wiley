         <title>A Traceless Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation on Native Antibodies Enables Efficient One&#8208;Step Payload Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct chemical modification of native antibodies in a site&#8208;specific manner remains a great challenge due to the complicated structural characteristics of antibodies. Ligand&#8208;directed conjugation can achieve the selective modification of antibodies, but usually requires multiple extra steps for ligand release and cargo assembly. Herein, we report a novel, traceless strategy to enable the facile and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of site&#8208;specific antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) by harnessing a thioester&#8208;based acyl transfer reagent. The designed reagent, consisting of an optimized Fc&#8208;targeting ligand, a thioester bridge and a toxin payload, directly assembles the toxin precisely onto the K251 position of native IgGs and simultaneously self&#8208;releases the affinity ligand in one step. With this traceless, one&#8208;step method, we successfully synthesized a series of K251&#8208;linked ADCs from native Trastuzumab. These ADCs demonstrated excellent homogeneity, thermal stability, and both  in vitro  and  in vivo  anti&#8208;tumor activity. This strategy is equally efficient for IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subtypes. The current work presents a robust, traceless, site&#8208;specific antibody functionalization via a self&#8208;releasing strategy, and offers a novel acyl transfer design for broad potential application in ligand&#8208;directed protein modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Distorted Antimony (III) Chloride [Sb2Cl8]2&#8208; Dimers for Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence up to 1070 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date. This study presents three novel 0D hybrid antimony chlorines with edge&#8208;sharing [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers, showing the unusual room&#8208;temperature broadband NIR emission with the maximum emission wavelength even up to 1070 nm. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation analysis demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom. The reported hybrid antimony chlorines with [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers herein expand the paradigm for discovering new NIR materials in 0D metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Dihydrogen Activation by Mononuclear Iridium(II) Compounds: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organometallic chemistry of 4d and 5d transition metals has been vastly dominated by closed&#8208;shell states. The reactivity of their metalloradical species is though remarkable, albeit yet poorly understood and with limited mechanistic investigations available. In this work we report the synthesis and characterization of two mononuclear Ir(II) species, including the first dinitrogen adduct. These compounds activate dihydrogen at a dissimilar rate, in the latter case several orders of magnitude faster than its Ir(I) precursor. A combined experimental/computational investigation to ascertain the mechanism of this transformation in Ir(II) compounds is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hybrid Ultramicroporous TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni under Humid Conditions Using Non&#8208;Equilibrium Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs, pore size &lt; 7 &#197;) are benchmark physisorbents for trace&#160;carbon dioxide&#160;(CO2)&#160;capture under dry conditions, their affinity for&#160;water&#160;(H2O)&#160;mitigates their carbon capture performance in humid conditions. Herein, we&#160;report on the co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2&#160;by TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni&#8212;a high CO2&#160;affinity HUM&#8212;and&#160;find that slow H2O sorption kinetics can enable CO2&#160;uptake and release using shortened adsorption cycles with retention of&#160;ca.&#160;90% of dry CO2&#160;uptake. Insight into co&#8208;adsorption is provided by&#160;in situ&#160;infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations. The binding sites and sorption mechanisms reveal that both CO2&#160;and H2O molecules occupy the same ultramicropore through favorable interactions between CO2&#160;and H2O at low water loading. An energetically favored water network displaces CO2&#160;molecules at higher loading. Our results offer bottom&#8208;up design principles and insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2&#160;and H2O that is likely to be relevant across the full spectrum of carbon capture sorbents to better understand and address the challenge posed by humidity to gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machines for spatially resolved searching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repurposing the RNA&#8208;guided endonuclease Cas9 to develop artificial CRISPR molecular machines represents a new direction toward synthetic molecular information processing. The operation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9&#8208;based machines, nevertheless, relies on the molecular recognition of freely diffused sgRNA/Cas9, making it practically challenging to perform spatially regulated localized searching or navigation. Here, we develop a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule CRISPR machine that can perform spatially resolved DNA cleavage via either free or localized searching modes. When triggered at a specific site on the DNA origami with nanoscale accuracy, the free searching mode leads to searching activity that gradually decays with the distance, whereas the localized mode generates spatially&#8208;confined searching activity. Our work expands the function of CRISPR molecular machines and lays foundations to develop integrated molecular circuits and high&#8208;throughput nucleic acid detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Precise Fabrication of One&#8208;handed Helical Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Programming the organization of semiconducting polymers to form well&#8208;defined nanoarchitectures is desirable for fabricating functional materials. In this work, semiconducting copolymers,  poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)  (PCA&#8208;  b  &#8208;P3HT) containing helical PCA and poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PAA&#8208;  b  &#8208;P3HT) containing achiral PAA segments, were prepared. Crystallization of P3HT and helicity of PCA drove PCA&#8208;  b  &#8208;P3HT self&#8208;assemble into spherical nanoparticles that gradually transformed into one&#8208;handed helical nanofibers. The chirality of PCA was transferred to the supramolecular architectures, induced high optical activity in P3HT. Interestingly, the chiral seed micelles of PCA&#8208;  b  &#8208;P3HT induced asymmetric copolymerization of achiral PAA&#8208;  b  &#8208;P3HT, which led to helical supramolecular block copolymers with defined helicity and controlled length. Remarkably, the supramolecular copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral RuII&#8208;PtII Complexes Inducing Telomere Dysfunction against Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers presents a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular crowding conditions within cells diminish the potency of current G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Herein, chiral Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complexes were developed as highly potent G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers even under challenging molecular crowding conditions. The compounds were encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages to enhance sub&#8208;cellular localization and provide cancer selectivity. The nanoparticles were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous activities of telomerase in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells and cause cell death by apoptosis. The nanomaterials demonstrated high antitumor activity towards cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells as well as tumor&#8208;bearing mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a Ru(II)&#8208;Pt(II) dinuclear complex as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer with an anti&#8208;cancer effect towards drug&#8208;resistant tumors inside an animal model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intramolecular chlorine&#8208;sulfur (Cl&#8208;S) non&#8208;covalent interaction is introduced to modify the molecular backbone of a benchmark small&#8208;molecule donor (SMD) BTR to help planarize the molecular framework for improving charge transport. Theoretical simulations and temperature&#8208;variable NMR experiments clearly validate the existence of Cl&#8208;S non&#8208;covalent interaction in BP&#8208;Cl and BM&#8208;Cl and explain its important role in enhancing planarity and rigidity of the molecules for enhancing their crystallinity. Moreover, the asymmetric isomerization of side&#8208;chains by shifting the alkyl group from  para  &#8208; to  meta  &#8208;position on the phenyl ring further optimizes the molecular orientation and surface energy of BM&#8208;Cl to strike a balance between its crystallinity and miscibility. This carefully manipulated molecular design helps result in increased carrier mobility and suppressed charge recombination to obtain simultaneously enhanced  J  SC  and FF and a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.73% in binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;Field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanoplatform is developed as a Mn reservoir that exhibits efficient storage, specific delivery and accurate release of Mn ions for high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. Such a smart nanoplatform can exert a responsive imaging signal in dual&#8208;mode (T1&#8208; or T2&#8208;weighted) high&#8208;field MRI, which enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of Mn release within the tumor microenvironment and of ferroptosis initiation.







Abstract
Ferroptosis exhibits potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and the lack of reliable imaging for monitoring the ferroptosis process in living systems. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within the tumor to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, produce O2 and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts a responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T1&#8208;/T2&#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to store, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of Various Low&#8208;Bandgap Donor&#8211;Acceptor Alternating Conjugated Polymers via Living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Chung&#8208;Mo Park at Seoul National University on the occasion of his retirement and his life&#8208;long achievement in research and educationDonor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers with various electronic characteristics, including strong donor&#8211;strong acceptor, are synthesized via living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization in a controlled manner. The polymerization also works with a complex quateraryl monomer and allows for one&#8208;pot di(tri)block copolymer synthesis. The resulting polymers have tunable optical and electrochemical properties based on the combination of building units.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) using a RuPhos Pd G3 precatalyst is a versatile method for the precision synthesis of various donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (DA ACPs). First, the living SCTP of biaryl monomers with combinations of both medium to strong A and D were optimized to produce DA ACPs with controlled number average molecular weight (Mn), narrow dispersity (&#208;, 1.05&#8211;1.29), and high yield (&gt;87&#8201;%). Moreover, its expansion to controlled polymerization (Mn=9.2&#8211;40.0&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of an A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2&#8208;D quateraryl monomer containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; strong A) was successful. The living SCTP also enabled the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of various diblock and triblock copolymers. Lastly, the DA ACPs showed tunable optical band gap (Egopt, from 1.29 to 1.77&#8197;eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (from &#8722;5.57 to &#8722;4.75&#8197;eV), while their block copolymers exhibited broad absorption ranges and promising visible light&#8208;harvesting properties.

         <title>Alkyl/Glycosyl Sulfoxides as Radical Precursors and Their Use in the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides are shown to be suitable precursors to radicals. Alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which, upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to give various pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and N&#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl C&#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclopentyl Boronic Esters Bearing Contiguous Fully Substituted Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes enables the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.







Abstract
The synthesis of molecules bearing two or more contiguous, quaternary stereocenters is challenging, owing to the difficulty in controlling stereochemistry whilst simultaneously constructing a sterically congested motif. Herein, we report the electrophile&#8208;induced ring contractive 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of 6&#8208;membered cyclic alkenyl boronate complexes for the synthesis of cyclopentyl boronic esters bearing two contiguous, fully substituted stereocenters with high levels of stereocontrol. Remarkably, simple variation of the reaction solvent enabled their diastereodivergent construction with facile access to complementary diastereomeric pairs. The utility of our methodology is demonstrated in the asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;herbertene&#8208;1,14&#8208;diol.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated the first fast&#8208;scanning potential&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP&#8208;OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.







Abstract
Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined use of FSP as a gating mode and transconductance (gm) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility, and stability. The FSP&#8208;OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899&#8197;S&#8201;M&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection down to 5&#8197;nM and was validated for in vivo monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong electronic interactions between hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and Cu2O protect the Cu&#8722;O bonds against electron attack through the transfer of accumulated electrons from Cu2O to h&#8208;BN. This effect stabilizes the active Cu+ species during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO2RR activity, Cu+ in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu2O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu+. The C2H4/CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO2RR with Cu2O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu2O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu2O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu2O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO2RR and stabilizing the Cu+ species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu+ species enhanced the C2 product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu2O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Metathesis Reactions of a NHC&#8208;Stabilized Phosphaborene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable compounds with a genuine B=P double bond are rare and have limited applications given their protecting groups&#8242; bulky nature. The preparation of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene with a B=P double bond and a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal is reported, which exhibits an unprecedented ability for B=P&#8208;unit transfer reactions, allowing the isolation of B=P&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
The BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.

Carbene&#8208;copper&#8208;amide thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring &#960;&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands show exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and can deliver stable and high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color CuI&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;hours at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;high brightness up to 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air&#8208; and thermally stable two&#8208;coordinate CuI emitters featuring bulky pyrazine&#8208; (PzIPr) or pyridine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide&#8208;Cu&#8208;carbene bonding interactions. These CuI emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the 1LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Vapour&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on these CuI emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the CuI&#8208;TADF emitters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air- and thermally stable two-coordinate Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters featuring bulky pyrazine- (PzIPr) or pyridine-fused N-heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide-Cu-carbene bonding interactions. These Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Vapour-deposited OLEDs based on these Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Back&#8208;Gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;Tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microcell&#8208;based in&#8197;situ electronic/electrochemical system was designed to unlock the fixed charge transfer of a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction under an electric field. The charges across the van der Waals (vdW) channel distribute to three Mo atoms adjacent to S vacancies and strengthen Mo&#8722;H bonding. The catalyst design enables precise regulation of the electronic configuration.







Abstract
Charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Establishing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies beyond conventional methods. We describe exertion of an external electric field in the cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the band gap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. In&#8197;situ photoluminescence spectra and gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement reveal a linear correlation between the charge accumulation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. This approach provides a new strategy for the design of catalysts, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Efficient Chiral Induction by Helicene&#8208;Type Additives in Copolymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special class of helicene&#8208;type additives, which are straightforward to synthesize in large amounts, induce strong chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films. Advanced chirality&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods based on transient circular dichroism and transient circularly polarized luminescence reveal the supramolecular origin of the chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We observed efficient induction of chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films by mixing with helicene&#8208;type chiral additives based on the dibenzo[c,h]acridine motif. Images obtained from circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) microscopy provide information about the chiral arrangements in the thin films with diffraction&#8208;limited resolution. The CD signal shows a characteristic dependence on the film thickness, which supports a supramolecular origin of the strong chiral response of the copolymer. In particular, we demonstrate the discrimination between films of opposite chirality based on their ultrafast transient chiral response through the use of femtosecond broadband CD spectroscopy and a newly developed setup for transient CPL spectroscopy with 28&#8197;ps time resolution. A systematic variation of the enantiomeric excess of the chiral additive shows that the &#8220;Sergeants and Soldiers&#8221; concept and &#8220;Majority Rules&#8221; are not obeyed.

         <dc:description>Herein, we develop a novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed as the Trojan nanobacteria system, which is made of nanoagents internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin&#160;(MD) transporters. Compared with the system of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, the presented Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability.&#160;In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Afterwards, Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues, which is due to the synergistic effects of antitumor protein (  e.g.,  tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) expression and photothermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung AlaB Reagents for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteogenic Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amino acid synthon in the form of boronoalanine (AlaB) suitable for umpolung peptide/protein functionalization is described. It is demonstrated that AlaB can be incorporated into peptides and proteins, and remains stable under solid&#8208;phase synthesis, native chemical ligation, and radical desulfurization. Furthermore, AlaB is a competent partner in inter(intra)molecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids and functionalized peptides are important motifs in modern drug discovery. Here we report that AlaB can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of AlaB from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of &#946;&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that AlaB can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. AlaB is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of AlaB&#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, AlaB reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, AlaB synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.

Furthermore, Ala&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; reagents participate in Pd-catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross-couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, Ala&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Elimination of Chlorine from a Carbene&#8208;Xanthylium Gold(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex combining an ambiphilic carbene/xanthylium ligand and a gold trichloride supports the efficient green&#8208;light&#8208;induced extrusion of chlorine radicals en route to the corresponding gold(I) complex. The photolability of this gold(III) complex originates from excitation of a carbene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad, the excited state of which challenges the inherent stability of the gold(III) moiety.







Abstract
With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([7]+) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [7]+ featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [7]+.

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although doubted in the past, two &#960;&#8208;electrons are just enough to stabilize five&#8208;membered aromatic compounds that are even stable at room&#8208;temperature, as shown by the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene. This compound is a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths.







Abstract
Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirm its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol at Close to Theoretical Potential via Engineering Abundant Electron&#8208;Donating Cu&#948;+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2S1&#8722;x hollow nanocubes with abundant and stable Cu&#948;+ species are designedly synthesized and achieve ethanol&#8208;selective electrosynthesis. The abundant Cu&#948;+ sites have electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to liquid multi&#8208;carbon alcohols provides a promising way for intermittent renewable energy reservation and greenhouse effect mitigation. Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can produce ethanol, but the in situ formed Cu&#948;+ is insufficient and easily reduced to Cu0. Here a Cu2S1&#8722;x catalyst with abundant Cu&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;1) species is designedly synthesized and exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 0.19&#8197;V for ethanol production. The catalyst not only delivers an outstanding ethanol selectivity of 86.9&#8201;% and a Faradaic efficiency of 73.3&#8201;% but also provides a long&#8208;term stability of Cu&#948;+, gaining an economic profit based on techno&#8208;economic analysis. The calculation and in situ spectroscopic results reveal that the abundant Cu&#948;+ sites display electron&#8208;donating ability, leading to the decrease of the reaction barrier in the potential&#8208;determining C&#8722;C coupling step and eventually making the applied potential close to the theoretical value.

         <title>Bioinspired and Ligand&#8208;Regulated Unnatural Prenylation and Geranylation of Oxindoles with Isoprene under Pd Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy has been developed for the bioinspired and ligand&#8208;regulated chemoselective unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles with isoprene under Pd catalysis. The selectivity was governed by modulating the coordination geometry of the Pd catalyst.







Abstract
In nature, prenylation and geranylation are two important metabolic processes for the creation of hemiterpenoids and monoterpenoids under enzyme catalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated bioinspired unnatural prenylation and geranylation of oxindoles using the basic industrial feedstock isoprene through ligand regulation under Pd catalysis. Pentenylated oxindoles (with C5 added) were attained with high selectivity when using a bisphosphine ligand, whereas upon switching to a monophosphine ligand, selectivity toward geranylated oxindoles (with C10 added) was achieved. Moreover, the head&#8208;to&#8208;head product could be further isomerized to an internal skipped diene under Pd&#8722;H catalysis. No stoichiometric by&#8208;product was formed in the process.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Layered Lithium Oxides through Cation Vacancies for Enhanced Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beginning with cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2, the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations was studied. The results indicate that lattice oxygen activated by cation vacancies triggered charge disproportionation to form high&#8208;activity Ni4+, resulting in facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.







Abstract
Despite the fact that high&#8208;valent nickel&#8208;based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2 (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO&#8208;2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with excellent stability after the 160&#8197;h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO2 with moderate cation vacancies triggers charge disproportion of the Ni site to form Ni4+ species, facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with cation-vacancy controllable LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations was studied. The results indicate that lattice oxygen activated by cation vacancies triggered charge disproportionation to form high-activity Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that high-valent nickel-based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation-vacancy controllable LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO-2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; along with excellent stability after the 160&#8197;h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with moderate cation vacancies triggers charge disproportion of the Ni site to form Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; species, facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes enabled by copper hydride and palladium cooperative catalysis was developed. Utilizing readily available carbamoyl chlorides, this method can be applied to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, providing &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Reductive Carbon&#8211;Carbon Coupling on Metal Sites Regulates Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Water Using ZnSe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive carbon&#8211;carbon coupling was used to block H2 evolution in CO2 photoreduction in water. Furfural, one of the biomass platform molecules, adsorbs on Zn&#8208;sites consuming electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, but the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies remains. Therefore, CO was evolved with a CO/H2 ratio of 265&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the gas phase and furfural was upgraded to value&#8208;added hydrofuroin.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) consisting of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements show attractive potentials towards solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. However, the inhibition of hydrogen (H2) production in aqueous solution remains a challenge. Here, we describe the first example of a carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reaction to block the competing H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction in water. In a specific system taking ZnSe QDs as photocatalysts, the introduction of furfural can significantly suppress H2 evolution leading to CO evolution with a rate of &#8776;5.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover number (TON) of &gt;7500 under 24&#8197;h visible light. Meanwhile, furfural is upgraded to the self&#8208;coupling product with a yield of 99.8&#8201;% based on the consumption of furfural. Mechanistic insights show that the reductive furfural coupling reaction occurs on surface Zn&#8208;sites to consume electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, while the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies from CO2 remains.

         <dc:description>We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc = biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2 mmol g&#8208;1 at 0.1 bar and 298 K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500 ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed Cu(II) or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopic and inelastic neutron scattering &#160;enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8208;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. The refinement of pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiotherapy&#8208;Induced Cleavage of Quaternary Ammonium Groups Activates Prodrugs in Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cleavage chemistry offers a new chance to activate chemotherapeutic prodrugs in a tumor&#8208;selective manner, yet developing spatiotemporally controllable cleavage chemistry with deep tissue penetration is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a novel radiotherapy&#8208;triggered cleavage chemistry that enables controlled drug release in tumors. Quaternary ammonium groups are identified as masking groups that can be efficiently removed by hydrated electrons (e  &#8208;  aq  ) from water radiolysis. The subsequently released tertiary amines can be anti&#8208;cancer toxins or readily release functional molecules via 1,6&#8208;elimination. This radiotherapy&#8208;induced cleavage works successfully in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, showing remarkable treatment efficacy when the mice are given carfilzomib prodrug and radiotherapy. This strategy provides a new perspective for combinational radiochemotherapy, which is the first&#8208;line treatment for over 50% of cancer patients.</dc:description>

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Here we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. We suppose the reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution commonly recognized due to iminium activation through LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) lowering. A wide range of substrates are compatible with this protocol giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.</dc:description>

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8208;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through the periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1:1 complex in toluene.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating the  Structure of Carbon Dots via Crystalline &#960; &#8208;aggregated  Organic Nanodots Prepared by Kinetically Trapped Self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports the successful preparation of a new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#160;nm) by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly, which is then used as  a simplified  &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the structure of CDs.  The precise structure and J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced photoluminescence (PL) of the nanodots are revealed by investigating the structural relationship between the nanodots and the corresponding single crystals and their properties.  Compared with the single crystals, crystalline organic nanodots show longer PL lifetime, higher PL quantum yield, and narrower PL peak, indicating that they are potential organic quantum nanodots. In addition, the efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking environment in the corresponding single crystals can promote &#960;&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced PL anisotropy. This work indicates crystalline organic nanodots with precise structures to be potentially useful for understanding the structures of CDs and to be attractive potential luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosome Interference Enabled by Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Assembly of DNA Nanoframework inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing material chemistry systems coupled with biological processes is a promising way to rationally modulate lysosomal functions. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;driven dynamic assembly of DNA nanoframework inside cells coupled with the lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways/lysosomal maturation, achieving the rational modulation of lysosomal functions, which we termed as lysosome interference. Through lysosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis, DNA nanoframework with acid&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;i&#8208;motif entered into lysosome and assembled into aggregate triggered by lysosomal acidity, which performed a long&#8208;term retention. Meanwhile, the consumption of protons resulted in lysosomal acidity reduction and hydrolase activity attenuation, thereby alleviating the degradation of nucleic acid drugs in interfered lysosomes and improving gene silencing effect. This study explores a new avenue to achieve lysosome interference by coupling subcellular microenvironment and precisely&#8208;programmable assembly system.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Activation and Ni&#8208;S Stabilization in NiO/NiS2 for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the active species and improving the structural stabilization of sulfur&#8208;containing catalysts during the OER process remain a tremendous challenge. Herein, we constructed NiO/NiS  2  and Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  as catalyst models to study the effect of Fe doping. As expected, Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . The accumulation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials after Fe doping can promote the formation of high active NiOOH at a lower OER potential. Moreover, we investigated the level of corrosion of M&#8208;S bonds and compared the stability variation of M&#8208;S bonds with Fe at different locations. Interestingly, Fe bonded with S in the bulk as the sacrificial agent can alleviate the oxidation corrosion of partial Ni&#8208;S bonds and thus endow Fe &#8208; NiO/NiS  2  long&#8208;term durability. This work would motivate the community to focus more on resolving the corrosion of sulfur&#8208;containing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Local Free Water Enriched Microenvironment for Surpassing Platinum Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface to push reactants into inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) is desirable for efficient electrocatalysts, however, has rarely been implemented due to the elusive electrochemical IHP and inert catalyst surface. Here, we propose the introduction of local force fields by surface hydroxyl group to engineer the electrochemical microenvironment and enhance alkaline hydrogen evolution activity. Taking hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure as a prototype, we revealed that the local hydrogen bond induced by the surface hydroxyl group drag 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded H  2  O molecules across the IHP to become free H  2  O and thus continuously supply reactants for catalytic sites. In addition, the hydroxyl group coupled with Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure further lowers the water dissociation energy by polarization effect. As a direct outcome, hydroxyl&#8208;rich catalysts surpass Pt/C activity at high current density (500 mA cm  &#8208;2  @ ~276 mV) in alkaline medium.</dc:description>

Taking hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure as a prototype, we revealed that the local hydrogen bond induced by the surface hydroxyl group drag 4-coordinated hydrogen-bonded H  2  O molecules across the IHP to become free H  2  O and thus continuously supply reactants for catalytic sites. In addition, the hydroxyl group coupled with Ni/Ni  3  C heterostructure further lowers the water dissociation energy by polarization effect. As a direct outcome, hydroxyl-rich catalysts surpass Pt/C activity at high current density (500 mA cm  -2  @ ~276 mV) in alkaline medium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PEG&#8208;Functionalized Hollow Multishelled Structures with On&#8208;Off Switch and Rate&#8208;Regulation for Controllable Antimicrobial Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of responsive antimicrobial carriers with multifunctional and controllable release is an attractive but challenging proposition. Recently developed hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) possess intrinsic structural advantages such as easily modifiable surfaces and mutually influenced shells. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted to realize their potential in drug&#8208;delivery systems. Herein, we report a novel pH&#8208;responsive antimicrobial carrier having hierarchical shells as multilevel responsive bodies using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a gated regulator. The interaction between PEG&#8208;functionalized shells endows them with a pH&#8208;responsive switch and rate&#8208;regulator capability. These features are present in the form of rapid release of molecules wrapped in the outer shell, and controlled diffusion of antimicrobials stored in the inner shell by electrostatic interaction, respectively, resulting in a long&#8208;lasting mildew resistance for up to 71 days. The versatility of the hierarchical interactions of HoMSs will inspire the design of promising smart drug carriers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Here we present the development of a  PluriZyme  , TR  2  E  2  , with efficient native transaminase (  k  cat  : 69.49&#177;1.77 min  &#8208;1  ) and artificial esterase (  k  cat  : 3908 to 0.41 min  &#8208;1  ) activities, integrated into a single scaffold and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR  2  E  2  (pH  opt  : 8.0&#8208;9.5; T  opt  : 60&#8208;65 &#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(  R  )&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester to the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently to the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR  2  E  2  PluriZyme  was proved with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Multivalent Porphyrin&#8211;Peptide Conjugates by Direct Porphyrin Construction on Resin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates with different propensities for self&#8208;assembly into various supramolecular nanoarchitectures play important roles in advanced materials and biomedical research. However, preparing prefunctionalized core porphyrins by traditional low&#8208;yielding statistical synthesis and purifying them after peptide ligation through many rounds of HPLC purification is tedious and unsustainable. Herein, we report a novel integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for the construction of porphyrin moieties from simple aldehydes and dipyrromethanes on resin&#8208;bound peptides directly to form mono&#8208;, cis/trans&#8208;di&#8208;, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates in a highly efficient and controllable manner; moreover, only single final&#8208;stage HPLC purification of the products is needed. This efficient strategy enables the rapid, greener, and substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of multivalent porphyrin&#8208;(long) peptide conjugate libraries for multifarious biological and materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence&#8208;Boosted Escape of DNAzyme from Endosomes for Enhanced Gene&#8208;Silencing Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous potential of DNAzyme for gene therapy, its efficacy is hampered by the limited endosomal escape capability. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNAzyme delivery platform to achieve enhanced gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. The nanoplatform is composed of therapeutic DNAzyme, photosensitizers (PSs) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that can convert NIR light to visible light. The system allows NIR light&#8208;activatable generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species due to the energy transfer from the UCNPs to PSs, which boosts the endosomal escape of DNAzyme for an improved gene&#8208;silencing efficacy. We demonstrate that the nanocomposites represent a promising platform to integrate DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy with NIR light&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy for combinational tumor treatment. This work highlights a robust approach to combat the current limitations of DNAzyme delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photostability and Dynamic Helical Behavior in Chiral Poly(phenylacetylene)s with a Preferred Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) are interesting materials due to the possibility of tuning their helical scaffold (sense and elongation) once they have been prepared and by the presence of external stimuli. The main limitation in the application of PPAs is their poor photostability. These polymers degrade under visible light exposure through a photochemical electrocyclization process. In this work, it was demonstrated, through a selected example, how the photochemical degradation in PPAs is directly related to their dynamic helical behavior. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic helical structures show poor photostability under UV&#8208;vis light exposure, poly&#8208;(  R  )&#8208;  1  , bearing an enantiopure sulfoxide group as pendant group and designed to have a quasi&#8208;static helical behavior, shows a large photostability due to the restricted conformational composition at the polyene backbone, needed to orient the conjugated double bonds prior to the photochemical electrocyclization process and the subsequent degradation of the material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper Cage&#8208;Complex as Mimic of the pMMO CuC Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and its mechanism of action are not known. Recently, the Cu  C  site emerged as a potential active site, but to date it lacks any study on biomimetic resemblance of the coordination environment provided by the enzyme. Here, the synthesis of a cage ligand providing such environment is reported. Copper is incorporated, and coordination occurs by the two imidazole and one carboxylate group offered by the ligand. Depending on the oxidation state, it can adopt different coordination modes, evidenced by solid state structures and computational investigation. The copper(I) state readily reacts with dioxygen and thereby undergoes CH activation. On top, the catalytic aerobic oxidation of hydroquinones as ubiquinol mimics is shown. Clean one electron oxidation occurs under mild conditions and EPR analysis of the copper(II) state in the presence of water reveals striking similarities to the data obtained from pMMO.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Nanostructured 3D Printed Materials by Controlling Macromolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured polymeric materials play important roles in many advanced applications, however, controlling the morphologies of polymeric thermosets remains a challenge. This work uses multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs to mediate polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) and prepare nanostructured materials via photoinduced 3D printing. The characteristic length scale of microphase&#8208;separated domains is determined by the macroCTA arm length, while nanoscale morphologies are controlled by the macroCTA architecture. Specifically, using 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; arm macroCTAs provides materials with different morphologies compared to analogous monofunctional linear macroCTAs at similar compositions. The mechanical properties of these nanostructured thermosets can also be tuned while maintaining the desired morphologies. Using multi&#8208;arm macroCTAs can thus broaden the scope of accessible nanostructures for extended applications, including the fabrication of actuators and potential drug delivery devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Crucial Roles of a Pendant Imidazole Ligand of a Cobalt Porphyrin Complex in the Stoichiometric and Catalytic Reduction of Dioxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cobalt porphyrin complex with a pendant imidazole base ([(L1)CoII]) is an efficient catalyst for the homogeneous catalytic two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen by 1,1&#8242;&#8208;dimethylferrocene (Me2Fc) in the presence of triflic acid (HOTf), as compared with a cobalt porphyrin complex without a pendant imidazole base ([(L2)CoII]). The pendant imidazole ligand plays a crucial role not only to provide an imidazolinium proton for proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2  in the presence of HOTf but also to facilitate electron transfer (ET) from [(L1)CoII] to O2  in the absence of HOTf. The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O2  have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L1)CoII] for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Aptamers with Selectively Enhanced Biostability in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer sgc8c equipped with an ATP&#8208;responsive protection module, termed ARP&#8208;sgc8c, was designed. ARP&#8208;sgc8c could be selectively protected from nuclease degradation in the tumor microenvironment through specific incorporation along with high&#8208;concentration ATP, while its rapid degradation was maintained in healthy tissues.







Abstract
Aptamers are emerging as promising molecular tools in cancer&#8208;targeted theranostics. Improving their in vivo stability has been a critical issue in promoting clinical translation, but such efforts could lead to more serious side effects resulting from prolonged retention in healthy organs. To address this problem, we developed an environment&#8208;responsive stabilization strategy for the selective enhancement of aptamer biostability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Briefly, by means of the end extension of an ATP&#8208;responsive protection (ARP) module, the designed aptamer could be protected from nuclease degradation through the specific incorporation of ATP. Based on our in vivo results, this ARP&#8208;aptamer probe was effectively accumulated in tumors via aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition. It showed selectively prolonged tumor retention time, but rapid digestion in healthy organs. Our strategy should provide a new paradigm for the development of organ&#8208;specific nucleic acid&#8208;based imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Native Ambient Mass Spectrometry of an Intact Membrane Protein Assembly and Soluble Protein Assemblies Directly from Lens Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integral membrane protein assembly Aquaporin&#8208;0 was analysed by native ambient mass spectrometry of eye lens tissue. Membrane protein assemblies were solubilised by detergent micelles. Spatially&#8208;resolved analysis for mapping protein assembly distributions, accurate intact mass determination, and the identification of assemblies approx. 100&#8197;kDa in molecular weight are demonstrated.







Abstract
Membrane proteins constitute around two&#8208;thirds of therapeutic targets but present a significant challenge for structural analysis due to their low abundance and solubility. Existing methods for structural analysis rely on over&#8208;expression and/or purification of the membrane protein, thus removing any links back to actual physiological environment. Here, we demonstrate mass spectrometry analysis of an intact oligomeric membrane protein directly from tissue. Aquaporin&#8208;0 exists as a 113&#8197;kDa tetramer, with each subunit featuring six transmembrane helices. We report the characterisation of the intact assembly directly from a section of sheep eye lens without sample pre&#8208;treatment. Protein identity was confirmed by mass measurement of the tetramer and subunits, together with top&#8208;down mass spectrometry, and the spatial distribution was determined by mass spectrometry imaging. Our approach allows simultaneous analysis of soluble protein assemblies in the tissue.

         <title>Tailored Multivalent Targeting of Siglecs with Photosensitizing Liposome Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach towards optically active biohybrid systems that selectively bind receptors of the sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins (siglecs) family is described. To this end, siglec&#8208;modified supported lipid bilayers act as cell membrane mimics that interact in a multivalent fashion with photosensitizer&#8208;loaded vesicles, showing a potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.







Abstract
The modification of surfaces with multiple ligands allows the formation of platforms for the study of multivalency in diverse processes. Herein we use this approach for the implementation of a photosensitizer (PS)&#8208;nanocarrier system that binds efficiently to siglec&#8208;10, a member of the CD33 family of siglecs (sialic acid (SA)&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins). In particular, a zinc phthalocyanine derivative bearing three SA moieties (PcSA) has been incorporated in the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), retaining its photophysical properties upon insertion into the SUV's membrane. The interaction of these biohybrid systems with human siglec&#8208;10&#8208;displaying supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) has shown the occurrence of weakly multivalent, superselective interactions between vesicle and SLB. The SLB therefore acts as an excellent cell membrane mimic, while the binding with PS&#8208;loaded SUVs shows the potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.

         <title>Molecular Motion and Nonradiative Decay: Towards Efficient Photothermal and Photoacoustic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, the molecular motion&#8208;facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect has been widely used to develop efficient photothermal and photoacoustic systems. To give a timely summary of this emerging field, the present Minireview systematically highlights the underlying mechanism, molecular design principles, and advanced applications of photothermal transduction agents with flexible molecular groups.







Abstract
Nonradiative decay invariably competes with radiative decay during the deexcitation process of matter. In the community of luminescence research, nonradiative decay has been deemed less attractive than radiative decay. However, all things in their being are good for something and so is nonradiative decay. As the molecular motion&#8208;facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect is inevitable in photophysical processes, it provides a new avenue to convert the harvested light energy into exploitable forms by harnessing molecular motion. In many cases, active molecular motion enables thermal deactivation from excited states. In this Minireview, recent advances in photothermal and photoacoustic systems with MMFND character are summarized. We believe that this presentation of the rational engineering of molecular motion for efficient photothermal generation will deepen the understanding of the relationship between molecular motion and nonradiative decay and navigate people to rethink the positive aspects of nonradiative decay for the establishment of new light&#8208;controllable techniques.

&lt;p&gt;Nonradiative decay invariably competes with radiative decay during the deexcitation process of matter. In the community of luminescence research, nonradiative decay has been deemed less attractive than radiative decay. However, all things in their being are good for something and so is nonradiative decay. As the molecular motion-facilitated nonradiative decay (MMFND) effect is inevitable in photophysical processes, it provides a new avenue to convert the harvested light energy into exploitable forms by harnessing molecular motion. In many cases, active molecular motion enables thermal deactivation from excited states. In this Minireview, recent advances in photothermal and photoacoustic systems with MMFND character are summarized. We believe that this presentation of the rational engineering of molecular motion for efficient photothermal generation will deepen the understanding of the relationship between molecular motion and nonradiative decay and navigate people to rethink the positive aspects of nonradiative decay for the establishment of new light-controllable techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>VPO4F Fluorophosphates Polyanion Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal criterion for proton cathodes was put forward combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, which might pave a new way for exploiting electrode materials for proton batteries. As a result, vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with high capacity.







Abstract
Proton batteries are emerging in electrochemical energy storage because of the associated fast kinetics, low cost and high safety. However, their development is hindered by the relatively low energy density due to the limited choice of cathode materials. Herein, metal phosphate polyanion cathodes are proposed as the proton cathode for the first time. Combining experimental results and theoretical simulations, a universal criterion for the proton cathode was put forward. Vanadium fluorophosphate (VPO4F) was demonstrated as a promising high&#8208;voltage proton cathode material with a specific capacity of 116&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high potential of 1.0&#8197;V (vs. SHE). The proton insertion/extraction mechanism in the VPO4F electrode was also verified through X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the stability of VPO4F was investigated in various electrolytes and the optimized electrolyte enabled the stable operation of VPO4F for 300&#8197;cycles. This work provides new inspiration in the exploitation of new electrode materials for electrochemical proton storage devices.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Board&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of molecular recognition and materials science, a multi&#8208;functional two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is prepared and applied as a board&#8208;spectrum adsorbent for the high&#8208;efficiency removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl pollutants.







Abstract
The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits board&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen&#8208;bond donors, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors, and fluorophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and board&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the board&#8208;spectrum affinity. FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.

         <title>Reversible Switchability of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetodielectric Effect Induced by Intermolecular Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triggered by thermally assisted intermolecular motion via hydrogen bonds, a CoII compound undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by reversible switching of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, magnetic anisotropy and magnetodielectric effect.







Abstract
Introducing magnetic switchability into artificial molecular machines is fascinating for precise control of magnetism via external stimuli. Herein, a field&#8208;induced CoII single&#8208;molecule magnet was found to exhibit the reversible switch of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion near room temperature, along with thermal conformational motion of the 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 rotor, which pulls the coordinated H2O to rotate through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and triggers a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition with Twarm=282&#8197;K and Tcool=276&#8197;K. Interestingly, the molecular magnetic anisotropy probed by single&#8208;crystal angular&#8208;resolved magnetometry revealed the reorientation of easy axis by 14.6&#176;. Moreover, ON/OFF negative magnetodielectric effects were respectively observed in the high&#8208;/low&#8208;temperature phase, which manifests the spin&#8208;lattice interaction in the high&#8208;temperature phase could be stronger, in accompanied by the hydrogen bonding between the rotating 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 and the coordinated H2O.

         <title>Methylamine Lithium Borohydride as Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion conductor based on methylamine lithium borohydride is reported. The new compound crystallizes in a layered two&#8208;dimensional structure with fast Li&#8208;ion migration in the interlayers. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as electrolyte is demonstrated with Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode material.







Abstract
Fast Li&#8208;ion conductivity at room temperature is a major challenge for utilization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Metal borohydrides with neutral ligands are a new emerging class of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors, and here we report the discovery of a new mono&#8208;methylamine lithium borohydride with very fast Li+ conductivity at room temperature. LiBH4&#8901;CH3NH2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, forming a two&#8208;dimensional unique layered structure. The layers are separated by hydrophobic &#8722;CH3 moieties, and contain large voids, allowing for fast Li&#8208;ionic conduction in the interlayers, &#963;(Li+)=1.24&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The electronic conductivity is negligible, and the electrochemical stability is &#8776;2.1&#8197;V vs Li. The first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery using a lithium borohydride with a neutral ligand as the electrolyte, Li&#8208;metal as the anode and TiS2 as the cathode is demonstrated.

         <title>Intramolecular Energy and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transfer within a BINOL&#8208;Perylene Hetero&#8208;Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) hetero&#8208;cyclophane comprising a chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) dye and a dynamically racemic PBI dye shows quantitative energy and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transfer among its components, thereby leading to an amplified bright red circularly polarized luminescence from PBI.







Abstract
Multichromophoric macrocycles and cyclophanes are important supramolecular architectures for the elucidation of interchromophoric interactions originating from precise spatial organization. Herein, by combining an axially chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) and a bay&#8208;substituted conformationally labile twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) within a cyclophane of well&#8208;defined geometry, we report a chiral PBI hetero&#8208;cyclophane (BBI&#8208;PBI) that shows intramolecular energy and solvent&#8208;regulated chirality transfer from the BBI to the PBI subunit. Excellent spectral overlap and spatial arrangement of BBI and PBI lead to efficient excitation energy transfer and subsequent PBI emission with high quantum yield (80&#8211;98&#8201;%) in various solvents. In contrast, chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the respective solvent as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The combination of energy and chirality transfer affords a bright red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the PBI chromophore by excitation of BBI.

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MG8, a novel polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome, with robust PET degradation activity, was discovered and characterized. It was further repurposed into a covalent binder of PET through genetic code expansion, enabling its use to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Thermomorphic Multiphasic System for Biocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applicability of a deep eutectic solvent thermomorphic multiphasic system (DES&#8208;TMS) within biocatalysis was successfully demonstrated. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was simply recycled using the DES&#8208;TMS. At increased temperatures, the system splits into an aqueous&#8208;enriched and a DES&#8208;enriched phase. In this way, the product and the catalyst were separated in a single unit operation step.







Abstract
The applicability of a thermomorphic multiphasic system (TMS) composed of a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) and an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase change for homogeneous biocatalysis was investigated. A lidocaine&#8208;based DES with the fatty acid oleic acid as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and presented within this study. We tested different additional components to the solvent system and observed a decrease in the cloud point of approximately 0.026&#8201;&#176;C per concentration unit. Distribution studies revealed a clear distribution of the protein in the aqueous buffer phase (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas the hydrophobic substrate and educt accumulated (&gt;95&#8201;%) in the DES&#8208;enriched layer. Finally, a reduction catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was performed in a larger&#8208;scale experiment, and the biocatalyst could be recycled by simply removing the DES phase for three recycling runs.

         <title>Enzymatic Enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydration of Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene monooxygenase catalyzed enantioselective anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of aryl alkenes, rather than epoxidation, was made possible by simply removing oxygen from the reaction mixture. An acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate enabled the reaction with excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity.







Abstract
The addition of water to alkenes is an important method for the synthesis of alcohols, but the regioselectivity of acid&#8208;catalyzed hydration of terminal alkenes yields secondary alcohols according to Markovnikov's rule, making it difficult to obtain primary alcohols. Here we report a styrene monooxygenase that catalyzes the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydration of the terminal aryl alkenes under anaerobic conditions. This hydration provides primary alcohols in good yields (up to 100&#8201;%), excellent anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1), and good enantiomeric purity (60&#8211;83&#8201;% ee). Residues Asn46, Asp100, and Asn309 are essential for catalysis suggesting an acid&#8211;base mechanism with a carbanion&#8208;like intermediate that could account for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity. Our work reveals a new enzymatic tool with unusual regioselectivity based on the promiscuous catalytic activity of a monooxygenase.

         <title>Mild Acidosis&#8208;Directed Signal Amplification in Tumor Microenvironment via Spatioselective Recruitment of DNA Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based strategy is developed for spatially&#8208;selective amplification of acidic signals in the extracellular milieu of tumors. Amplified imaging of the tumor microenvironment with improved sensitivity was achieved by acidity&#8208;responsive engineering of the cell surface with DNA receptors for controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers.







Abstract
DNA biotechnology offers intriguing opportunities for amplification&#8208;based sensitive detection. However, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled manipulation of signal amplification for in situ imaging of the tumor microenvironment remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based strategy that can spatial&#8208;selectively amplify the acidic signal in the extracellular milieu of the tumor to achieve specific imaging with improved sensitivity. The strategy, termed mild acidosis&#8208;targeted amplification (MAT&#8208;amp), leverages the specific acidic microenvironment to engineer tumor cells with artificial DNA receptors through a pH (low) insertion peptide, which permits controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers via a hybridization chain reaction. The acidosis&#8208;responsive amplification cascade enables significant fluorescence enhancement in tumors with a reduced background signal in normal tissues, leading to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. These results highlight the utility of MAT&#8208;amp for in situ imaging of the microenvironment characterized by pH disequilibrium.

         <dc:description>
The morphinan alkaloids, especially codeine and morphine, are derived from the opium poppy and have been used for millennia for pain management. They remain vital medicines today, but climate change and geopolitical uncertainties threaten existing supply chains. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203186), Martin&#8197;G. Banwell, Ping Lan et&#8197;al. detail by far the shortest synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;codeine reported to date, which involves a total &#8220;in&#8208;flask&#8221; time of fewer than twenty&#8208;four hours.

They remain vital medicines today, but climate change and geopolitical uncertainties threaten existing supply chains. In their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202203186"&gt;10.1002/anie.202203186&lt;/a&gt;), Martin&#8197;G. Banwell, Ping Lan et&#8197;al. detail by far the shortest synthesis of (&#8722;)-codeine reported to date, which involves a total &#8220;in-flask&#8221; time of fewer than twenty-four hours.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;Based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;Hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials by molecular design has become an important target in this research area. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202204358), Yoshio Hisaeda, Toshikazu Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a new bipyrrole&#8208;based boron difluoride family exhibiting intense multicolor luminescence with easy synthetic access. Tuning the rotational barrier around the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrrole affords CPL, and multi&#8208;colored CPLs are observed by controlling the aggregation state.

         <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive carbonylation of alkyl halides, aryl halides, and ethyl chloroformate is described. Ethyl chloroformate is utilized as a safe and readily available source of CO in this multi&#8208;component protocol, providing an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies highlight the complexity the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and provide insight into the sequence of the three consecutive oxidative additions  of aryl halide, chloroformate and akyl halide.</dc:description>

         <title>In Operando Visualization and Dynamic Manipulation of Electrochemical Processes at the Electrode&#8208;Solution Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Revealing the dynamic processes at the electrode&#8208;solution interface is imperative for understanding electrochemical phenomena. Most techniques have been developed to sense the electrode surface changes at the nanoscale, but provide limited information on potential&#8208;induced interfacial ion redistribution at the mesoscale. Herein, we present an in operando visualization method utilizing a microfabricated electrochemical cell combined with a laser scanning confocal microscope to observe high&#8208;resolution and fast&#8208;response interfacial processes. We report potential&#8208;induced formation and transformation of the Nernst diffusion layer, demonstrating that pulsed voltage dynamically perturbs the interface and promotes ion diffusion. This provides an additional insight into developing a dynamic manipulation method to control the electrochemical process. Our novel visualization method can easily be applied to monitor different ionic behaviors in electrochemical reactions at the mesoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>A PEGylated Tin&#8208;Porphyrin Complex for Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction: Mechanistic Insights into Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic proton reduction to form dihydrogen (H2) is an effective way to store energy in the form of chemical bonds. In this study, we validate the applicability of a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based tin porphyrin complex as an effective molecular electrocatalyst for proton reduction. A PEGylated Sn porphyrin complex (SnPEGP) displayed high activity (&#8211;4.6 mA/cm2 at &#8211;1.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+) and high selectivity (H2 Faradaic efficiency of 94% at &#8211;1.7 V vs. Fc/Fc+) in acetonitrile (MeCN) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099 s&#8211;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an Electron&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Electron&#8208;Chemical (ECEC) pathway. This study reveals that the tin porphyrin catalyst serves as a novel platform for investigating molecular electrocatalytic reactions and provides new mechanistic insights into proton reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rational Design and Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral C2&#8208;Arylpyrrole&#8208;Derived Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral biaryl diol BINOLs have achieved great success in asymmetric catalysis. By contrast, axially chiral biaryl amino alcohols, such as NOBIN, are far less developed. Herein, we have rationally designed a versatile  C  1  &#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold 1&#8208;(1&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NPNOL) on the basis of axially chiral C2&#8208;arylpyrrole framework. For its enantioselective synthesis, the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and azoalkenes had been established. By using this practical method, a wide range of NPNOLs were readily prepared in high yields and excellent atroposelectivities (38 examples, up to 89% yield and 99%  ee  ). DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. The easy transformations of NPNOL&#8208;derived products into organo&#8208;catalysts/ligands and their preliminary applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions demonstrated the promising utility of NPNOL.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon&#8208;Induced Post&#8208;Ionization to Boost Ion Yields in MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI&#8208;MSI) is a rapidly growing method in the life sciences. However, for many analyte classes, its sensitivity is limited due to poor ionization efficiencies. To mitigate this problem, we here introduce a novel postionization scheme based on single&#8208;photon induced chemical ionization using pulsed RF&#8208;Kr lamps. The fine&#8208;vacuum conditions of a dual ion&#8208;funnel ion source effectively thermalize the evolving MALDI plume and enable ample gas&#8208;phase reactions. Injected chemical dopants crucially support fragment&#8208;less ionization to [M+H]  +  /[M&#8208;H]  &#8208;  species. Based on this interplay, numerous glycerophospho&#8208;, sphingo&#8208;, and further lipids, registered from mammalian tissue sections, were boosted by up to three orders of magnitude, similar to results obtained with laser&#8208;based postionization (MALDI&#8208;2). Experiments with deuterated matrix and dopant, however, indicated complex chemical ionization pathways different from MALDI&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohols as Alkylating Agents: Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Alkylation via In Situ Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid exploration of sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is facilitated by fragment&#8208;coupling technologies that utilize simple and abundant alkyl precursors, among which alcohols are a highly desirable, commercially accessible, and synthetically versatile class of substrate. Herein, we describe an operationally convenient, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;mediated deoxygenative Giese&#8208;type addition of alcohol&#8208;derived alkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes under mild photocatalytic conditions. The fragment coupling accommodates a broad range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohol partners, as well as structurally varied Michael acceptors containing traditionally reactive sites, such as electrophilic or oxidizable moieties. We demonstrate the late&#8208;stage diversification of densely functionalized molecular architectures, including drugs and biomolecules, and we further telescope our protocol with metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;coupling for step&#8208;economic access to sp3&#8208;rich complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangement: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brook rearrangement has already established as one of the important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and been applied in the complex generation, drug discovery, material science and natural products synthesis. Comparing to its widely known ionic mechanism, radical Brook rearrangement is less explored due to the difficult generation of alkoxyl radical species. This minireview will summarize the early development and general concept of radical Brook rearrangement, highlight the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings involving radical Brook rearrangement. Furthermore, we hope this survey will inspire further development in this emerging area.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Access to &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;Branched/Linear Aliphatic Amines by Catalyst&#8208;Tuned Regiodivergent Hydroalkylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linear, &#945;&#8208;branched, and &#946;&#8208;branched aliphatic amines are widespread in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine chemicals. Thus, the development of direct and efficient methods to these structures in a tunable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear aliphatic amines from Ni/Co&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective hydroalkylations of alkenyl amines with alkyl halides is developed. This catalytic protocol features the reliable prediction and control of the coupling position of alkylation to provide orthogonal access to &#945;&#8208;branched, &#946;&#8208;branched and linear alkyl amines from identical starting materials. This platform unlocks orthogonal reactivity and selectivity of nickel hydride and cobalt hydride chemistry to catalytically repurpose three types of alkyl amines under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly and Linearly Polarized Luminescence from AIE Luminogens Induced by Super&#8208;aligned Assemblies of Sub&#8208;1 nm Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;1 nm nanowires (SNWs) combine the properties of inorganic materials and polymers. They can be highly oriented through assembly, and can also be easily processed. Meanwhile, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) show high potential for optical applications, but they are usually hard to be processed. The combination of SNWs and AIEgens can enrich both of their applications. In this study, we reported the fluorescence emission intensity of the AIEgens&#8208;SNW dispersion was dramatically enhanced due to the flexibility of SNWs. Furthermore, we fabricated two kinds of functional films with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL) activities. The construction of CPL materials didn&#8217;t require any chiral chemicals. The construction of LPL materials didn&#8217;t require an additional stretching process. As a result, we endowed common achiral AIEgens with a high dissymmetry factor of 0.033 and a polarization ratio of 0.44, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel AgI&#8208;DNA Rod Comprising a One&#8208;Dimensional Array of 11 Silver Ions within a Double Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AgI&#8208;DNA rod comprising a one&#8208;dimensional array of 11 silver ions within a double&#8208;helical structure was obtained by mixing an oligonucleotide and silver ions in appropriate solutions. Furthermore, formations of the rod structure in solutions were determined by UV/Vis, CD, NMR, and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
DNA/RNA duplexes containing metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated base pairs (metallo&#8208;base pairs) have potential applications in developing nucleic acid&#8208;based nanodevices and genetic code expansion. Many metallo&#8208;base pairs are formed within duplexes stabilized by Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Recently, the crystal structure of an AgI&#8208;DNA nanowire with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional silver array was determined. Here, we present a new DNA helical wire, the &#8220;AgI&#8208;DNA rod&#8221;, containing an uninterrupted array of 11&#8197;AgI ions. The AgI&#8208;DNA rod consisted of only C&#8208;AgI&#8208;C, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;G, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;5&#8208;bromouracil (BrU), and BrU&#8208;AgI&#8208;BrU metallo base pairs, with no Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. The AgI&#8208;DNA rods were connected by non&#8208;canonical G&#8211;G pairs in crystals. Notably, data from our absorbance, circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the AgI&#8208;DNA rods formed in solution, as well as within crystals.

         <title>Restoration of the Immunogenicity of Tumor Cells for Enhanced Cancer Therapy via Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Copper Chaperone Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination strategy for synergistic chemo&#8208;sensitization and conversion of tumor cells into vaccines triggers an intense immune response through copper chaperone inhibition with multifunctional nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin prodrugs and DC_AC50 conjugated to reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Recent progress in studying copper&#8208;dependent targets and pathways in the context of tumor treatment has provided new insights into therapeutic strategies of leveraging copper&#8208;dependent disease vulnerabilities and pharmacological manipulation of intratumor copper transportation to improve chemotherapy. Here, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles loaded with copper chaperone inhibitor DC_AC50 and cisplatin(IV) prodrug. The released DC_AC50 can promote a remarkable accumulation of intracellular cisplatin and copper through inhibition of the Atox1&#8208;ATPase pathways, thereby enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin and inducing significant ROS generation. Excessive ROS then elicits intense endoplasmic reticulin (ER) stress which facilitates the immunogenic cell death (ICD) spurring a sustained immune response. Our study suggests that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated copper chaperone inhibition via DC_AC50 can restore the immunogenicity of tumor cells for enhanced chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Complex Peptidyl Nucleoside Antibiotics: Asymmetric De Novo Syntheses of Miharamycin&#8197;B and Its Biosynthetic Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple building blocks were used for the total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor. The key step in the strategy was the de novo construction of the pyranose moiety through Achmatowicz rearrangement. The purine ring was introduced by palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Miharamycins belong to a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique nine&#8208;carbon pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2&#8208;aminopurine moiety. Herein, we report the de novo total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor from 3&#8208;bromofuran and Garner's aldehyde through a modified Achmatowicz reaction. Many challenges were resolved toward the de novo synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B, including the introduction of a dense array of functional groups, the stereoselective construction of consecutive stereocenters, dealing with the variability of the anomeric positions, and promoting site&#8208;selectivity in the cyclization to form the tetrahydrofuran ring. This de novo synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of 3&#8242;&#8208;substituted saccharides, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action, and meets the growing demand for the development of novel antibiotics inspired by miharamycin natural products.

         <title>S,O&#8208;Ligand Promoted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers has been realized by a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) and an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds with a broad range of aryl ethers. For the first time, unsymmetrical meta&#8208;diarylation of aryl ethers was accomplished using a novel norbornene. The isolation of palladium intermediates provides insight to the mechanism.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation processes provides new retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Here, we report a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene and an S,O&#8208;ligand for the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers that significantly outperforms previously reported systems. We demonstrate the unique ability of this system to employ alkoxyarene substrates bearing electron donating and withdrawing substituents. Additionally, ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ethers are well tolerated, overcoming the &#8220;ortho constraint&#8221;, which is the necessity to have a meta&#8208;substituent on the alkoxyarene to achieve high reaction efficiency, by enlisting novel norbornene mediators. Remarkably, for the first time the monoarylation of alkoxyarenes is achieved efficiently enabling the subsequent introduction of a second, different aryl coupling partner to rapidly furnish unsymmetrical terphenyls. Further insight into the reaction mechanism was achieved by isolation and characterization of some Pd&#8208;complexes&#8212;before and after meta C&#8722;H activation&#8212;prior to evaluation of their respective catalytic activities.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of In Situ Generated Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Complexes via Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their instability and reactivity, the structure of in situ generated iodane(III) species is challenging to characterize. VCD spectroscopy reveals a cationic species as the most important intermediate of a chiral triazole&#8208;containing aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane catalyst under oxidative conditions.







Abstract
The structure of in situ generated chiral aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes obtained under oxidative reaction conditions was not yet observable with experimental techniques and their proposed structures are purely based on DFT calculations. Herein, we establish vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy as an experimental technique to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, we were able to elucidate a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intramolecular N&#8722;I&#8208;interaction and no significant interactions with tosylate or m&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid as potential anionic ligands. Instead, aggregation of these substrates was found, which resulted in the formation of a non&#8208;coordinating anionic hydrogen bonded complex. The importance of VCD as a crucial experimental observable is further highlighted by the fact that our initial structural proposal, that was purely based on DFT calculations, could be falsified.

         <title>Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols by Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrolytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols has been developed. This direct catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes gives access to a variety of functionalized silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, including bis&#8208;silanols, in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Despite growing progress in the construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols is less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols by the catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes. This practical procedure features ambient reaction conditions, high atom economy, good functional&#8208;group compatibility, and H2 as the only by&#8208;product, and produces a wide range of valuable chiral silanols and bis&#8208;silanols in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Heteroatoms Enabled by Trichloroisocyanuric Acid and Potassium Fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative fluorination of various Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds was made significantly more accessible in recent years using potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant. Behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes insight and discussion on discoveries, applications, and opportunities associated with this &#8220;TCICA/KF approach&#8221; are chronicled herein.







Abstract
In synthetic method development, the most rewarding path is seldom a straight line. While our initial entry into pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) chemistry did not go according to plan (due to inaccessibility of reagents such as SF5Cl at the time), a &#8220;detour&#8221; led us to establish mild and inexpensive oxidative fluorination conditions that made aryl&#8208;SF5 compound synthesis more accessible. The method involved the use of potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant&#8212;as opposed to previously employed reagents such as F2, XeF2, HF, and Cl2. Thereafter, curiosity led us to explore applications of TCICA/KF as a more general approach to the synthesis of fluorinated Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds; this, in turn, prompted SC&#8208;XRD, VT&#8208;NMR, computational, and physical organic studies. Ultimately, it was discovered that TCICA/KF can be used to synthesize SF5Cl, enabling SF5 chemistry in an unexpected way.

         <title>Water Networks Repopulate Protein&#8211;Ligand Interfaces with Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;cooled water molecules block protein motions that impact protein&#8211;ligand interactions. Paired cryo and room&#8208;temperature comparisons of ligand&#8208;bound Hsp90&#945; structures show that water networks and protein conformations are more mobile at room temperature. Revealing such alternate conformational states that are masked by cryo&#8208;cooling provides new insights towards drug discovery.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures highlight the importance of water networks in protein&#8211;ligand interactions. However, as these are typically determined at cryogenic temperature, resulting insights may be structurally precise but not biologically accurate. By collecting 10 matched room&#8208;temperature and cryogenic datasets of the biomedical target Hsp90&#945;, we identified changes in water networks that impact protein conformations at the ligand binding interface. Water repositioning with temperature repopulates protein ensembles and ligand interactions. We introduce Flipper conformational barcodes to identify temperature&#8208;sensitive regions in electron density maps. This revealed that temperature&#8208;responsive states coincide with ligand&#8208;responsive regions and capture unique binding signatures that disappear upon cryo&#8208;cooling. Our results have implications for discovering Hsp90 selective ligands, and, more generally, for the utility of hidden protein and water conformations in drug discovery.

         <title>Ru&#8211;Co Pair Sites Catalyst Boosts the Energetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination manipulation strategy is proposed to achieve near&#8208;optimal adsorption energies for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates by constructing an atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co paired site on LiCoO2. Benefitting from the strong electronic interaction between Ru and Co, the Ru&#8722;Co/LiCoO2 nanosheets exhibit accelerated charge transfer capability, strengthened Co&#8722;O covalency, optimized eg filling, and then the resulting superior OER activity.







Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment of the active center via anion modulation to reveal tailored activity and selectivity has been widely achieved, especially for carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs). However, tuning ligand fields of the active center by single&#8208;site metal cation regulation and identifying the effects on the resulting electronic configuration is seldom explored. Herein, we propose a single&#8208;site Ru cation coordination strategy to engineer the electronic properties by constructing a Ru/LiCoO2 SAC with atomically dispersed Ru&#8722;Co pair sites. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling between Ru and Co sites, the catalyst possesses an enhanced electrical conductivity and achieves near&#8208;optimal oxygen adsorption energies. Therefore, the optimized catalyst delivers superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential, the high mass activity of 1000&#8197;A&#8201;goxide&#8722;1 at a small overpotential of 335&#8197;mV, and excellent long&#8208;term stability. It also exhibits rapid kinetics with superior rate capability and outstanding durability in a zinc&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Five Lycopodium Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids were accomplished in an enantioselective and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. The syntheses included a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization and the establishment of skeletal diversification approaches at different reactive sites of the tricyclic skeleton to achieve a divergent total syntheses of Lycopodium alkaloids.







Abstract
It is reported herein that by exploiting the commonly shared bicyclic decahydroquinoline motif, a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;alkyne cycloisomerization reaction is developed to access tricyclic cores in a simple way. These tricyclic cores further serve as an advanced platform for the divergent enantioselective collective total syntheses of five Lycopodium alkaloids, belonging to three different structural types, in a concise and protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free fashion. The key transformations in the second phase include: 1)&#8197;a transannular reductive Heck cyclization for installation of the azepane ring in fawcettidine, fawcettimine, and lycoposerramine&#8197;Q; 2)&#8197;a domino Mukaiyama hydration/Grob fragmentation process for construction of the ten&#8208;membered lactam system in phlegmariurine&#8197;B; 3)&#8197;a Fukuyama one&#8208;pot protocol for the construction of the 2&#8208;pyridone motif in lycoposerramine&#8197;R. The newly developed strategy is expected to pave the way for the synthesis of other structurally related Lycopodium alkaloids.

         <title>Embedding Multiphoton Active Units within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Turning on High&#8208;Order Multiphoton Excited Fluorescence for Bioimaging</title>

The galactose&#8208;modified zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework ZTIG, which has high order multi&#8208;photon excited fluorescence properties, can realize NIR&#8208;II excited fluorescent imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescent materials for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging has always been an intractable challenge. In this study, a reasonable strategy guided by theoretical calculations was employed to fabricate a novel high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF)&#8208;responsive UiO&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, ZrTc). Strategically, the functionalization of the photonic&#8208;responsive thiazolothiazole&#8208;based organic ligand gave rise to amplified H&#8208;MPEF (four&#8208;photon activity) performance and prolonged excitation wavelength (1550&#8197;nm) of ZrTcI. The results reveal that the extended &#960;&#8208;electron system, enhanced charge transfer, improved dipole moment, and weakened &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions within the MOFs endow them with excellent H&#8208;MPEF performance for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging. It is an extremely rare report on H&#8208;MPEF bioimaging using MOFs and provide a universal strategy for the fabrication of H&#8208;MPEF&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Intramolecular C&#8722;H Activation as an Easy Toolbox to Synthesize Pyridine&#8208;Fused Bipolar Hosts for Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular oxidative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reactions have been developed to rapidly build a library of structurally and functionally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons. This new synthetic strategy allowed to explore and highlight the high performance of bipolar host materials for blue OLEDs.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenging task. While exploiting new blue emitters has attracted great interest, developing host materials that considerably determine device performance obviously lags behind. Herein, we present an ease of access to the structurally diverse benzoheteroaromatic&#8208;fused pyridine skeletons by the iridium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling reaction, which unlocks an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of pyridine&#8208;fused bipolar host materials. As an illustrated example, the benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine skeleton (BTP) has been made to a pseudo&#8208;symmetric host (DCz&#8208;BTP). The merging of a pyridine fragment enables strong intermolecular interactions, leading to satisfactory bipolar transporting properties. Utilizing DCz&#8208;BTP as the host, blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs (TADF&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8&#8197;V and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 29.0&#8201;% and blue TADF&#8208;sensitized florescent OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) give an EQEmax as high as 20.5&#8201;%, revealing the potential of the BTP skeleton for the construction of high&#8208;performance host materials.

Utilizing &lt;b&gt;DCz-BTP&lt;/b&gt; as the host, blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs (TADF-OLEDs) exhibit a low turn-on voltage of 2.8&#8197;V and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 29.0&#8201;% and blue TADF-sensitized florescent OLEDs (TSF-OLEDs) give an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; as high as 20.5&#8201;%, revealing the potential of the &lt;b&gt;BTP&lt;/b&gt; skeleton for the construction of high-performance host materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of a Hybrid 1&#8208;Bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene Heteroarene Anion Derivative</title>

The unique synthesis of a boryl&#8208;substituted borole system by means of a 1,1&#8208;hydroboration/1,1&#8208;alkenylboration sequence provided access to the unprecedented 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene class of compounds.







Abstract
The B(C6F5)2&#8208;substituted borole 2&#8901;SMe2 was obtained from the phenyl bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) borane SMe2 adduct (1&#8901;SMe2) by a synthetic sequence containing a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. Subsequent thermolysis at 50&#8201;&#176;C converted it to the bicyclic borenium/borate zwitterion 3&#8901;SMe2. Photolysis of 3&#8901;SMe2 gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative 4&#8901;SMe2, which after ligand exchange with N,N&#8208;dimesitylimidazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt 6. Some unique follow&#8208;up reactions of the unsaturated diboron containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles were investigated.

         <title>Intrinsic Ability of the &#223;&#8208;Oxidation Pathway To&#160;Produce Bioactive Styrylpyrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;pyrones with biological activities are mostly synthesised by polyketide synthases (PKSs) via iterative decarboxylative Claisen condensations. Remarkably, we found that some enzymes related to the fatty acid &#223;&#8208;oxidation pathway in  Escherichia coli  , namely the CoA&#8208;ligase FadD and the thiolases FadA and FadI, can synthesise styrylpyrones with phenylpropionic acids in vivo. The two thiolases directly utilise acetyl&#8208;CoA as an extender unit for carbon&#8208;chain elongation through non&#8208;decarboxylative Claisen condensation, thus making the overall reaction more efficient in terms of carbon and energy consumption. Moreover, using a cell&#8208;free approach, different styrylpyrones were synthesised in vitro. Finally, targeted feeding experiments led to the detection of styrylpyrones in other species, demonstrating that the intrinsic ability of the &#223;&#8208;oxidation pathway allows for the synthesis of such molecules in bacteria, revealing an important biological feature hitherto neglected.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free perovskites have arisen great interest for their chemical diversity and eco&#8208;friendly properties, and recently expanded into X&#8208;ray detection for superior carrier behavior.&#160;&#160;However, the size and shape complexity of organic components results in the difficulties on evaluating their stability from theoretical considerations in high&#8208;energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#183;H2O perovskite, where H2O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and perovskite host. Suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote the stiffness of lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &#956;&#964; products and structural flexibility of PAZE&#8208;NH4Br3&#183;H2O impel us to expand it into the flexible X&#8208;ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 0.19 &#956;Gyair&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 and superior spatial resolution of 5.0 lp mm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are the most important component of NIR light&#8208;emitting devices (LED) and are crucial for their performance in food detection, medical and bio&#8208;sensing applications. A major challenge at this stage is to design novel NIR luminescent materials to replace the traditional Cr3+&#8208;doped systems. This work reports an all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite&#160;Cs2AgBiCl6  single crystal that achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the NIR emission originates from self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, which can be enhanced by weakening the strong coupling between electrons and phonons. The high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of 51%, the extensive full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 270 nm and the outstanding stability provide important advantages of Cs2Ag0.05Na0.95BiCl6  single crystal as a NIR luminescent material. The single crystal based NIR LED demonstrated its potential applications in NIR spectral detection as well as night vision. This work demonstrates that the bismuth halide perovskites are promising candidates for broadband NIR luminescent materials and provides new application directions for luminescent metal halides.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherently tenuous adhesion strength and limited environmental tolerance of supramolecular adhesives severely restrict their application scenarios. It is challenging for the development of robust adhesives with extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, we report a new type of temperature&#8208;resistant crown&#8208;ether&#8211;protein (CEP) adhesive by harnessing synergistic host&#8211;guest molecular interactions between engineered crown ether and protein building blocks. The outputs of CEP adhesive demonstrate ultrahigh shearing adhesion strength of ~22 MPa over a wide temperature range from &#8208;196 to 200&#176;C, superior to other established supramolecular or polymeric adhesives. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition and internal bound water stablized the system and led to superb adhesion under extreme conditions. Thus, this work pioneers a molecular engineering approach for the generation of adhesives with tailored applications in extreme settings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two novel yttrium nitrides, YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  , were synthesized by direct reaction between yttrium and nitrogen at &#8764;100&#160;GPa and &#8764;3000 K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. High&#8208;pressure&#160;synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that the crystal&#160;structures of YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  feature a unique organization of nitrogen&#160;atoms&#8212;a previously unknown anionic N  18  macrocycle and a&#160;polynitrogen double helix, respectively. Density functional theory&#160;calculations, confirming the dynamical stability of the YN  6  and Y  2  N  11  &#160;compounds, show an anion&#8208;driven metallicity, explaining the unusual&#160;bond orders in the polynitrogen units. As the charge state of the&#160;polynitrogen double helix in Y  2  N  11  is different from that previously&#160;found in Hf  2  N  11  and because N  18  macrocycles have never been

predicted or observed, their discovery significantly extends the&#160;chemistry of polynitrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Hydrocarbon Materials as Highly Efficient Host for White Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A New Molecular Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, all efficient host materials reported for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) are constructed with heteroatoms, which have a crucial role in the device performance. However, it has been shown in recent years that the heteroatoms not only increase the design complexity but can also be involved in the instability of the PhOLED, which is nowadays the most important obstacle to overcome. Herein, we design pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHC) as very efficient hosts in high&#8208;performance white and blue PhOLEDs. With EQE of 27.7 %, the PHC&#8208;based white PhOLEDs display similar efficiency as the best reported with heteroatom&#8208;based hosts. Incorporated as a host in a blue PhOLED, which are still the weakest links of the technology, a very high EQE of 25.6 % is reached, overpassing, for the first time, the barrier of 25&#160;% for a PHC and FIrpic blue emitter. These performance show that the PHC strategy represents an effective alternative for the future development of the OLED industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Electrochemical Kinetic Parameters of Single LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 Particles with the Performance of Corresponding Porous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterizing microscale single particles directly is requested for dissecting the performance&#8208;limiting factors at the electrode scale. In this work, we build a single&#8208;particle electrochemical setup and develop a physics&#8208;based model for extracting the solid&#8208;phase diffusion coefficient (Ds) and exchange current density (i0) from electrochemical impedance measurements. We find that the carbon coating on LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 surface enhances i0. In addition, Ds and i0 decay irreversibly by ~25% and ~10%, respectively, when the cutoff charge voltage increases from 4.3 V to 4.4 V. Moreover, we correlate intrinsic parameters of single particles with the performance of porous electrodes. Porous electrodes assembled with active particles with higher i0 values deliver a greater capacity and faster capacity fade. The methods developed in this combined experimental and theoretical work can be useful in correlating the single&#8208;particle scale and porous&#8208;electrode scale for other similar systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active and Thermally Robust Nickel Enolate Catalysts for the Synthesis of Ethylene&#8208;Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion copolymerization of polar olefins and ethylene remains a significant challenge in part due to catalysts' low activity and poor thermal stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy toward addressing these obstacles through ligand design. Neutral nickel phosphine enolate catalysts with large phosphine substituents reaching the axial positions of Ni achieve activity of up to 7.7 &#180; 103 kg/(mol*h) (efficiency &gt; 35 &#180; 103 g copolymer/g Ni) at 110 &#176;C, notable for ethylene/acrylate copolymerization. NMR analysis of resulting copolymers reveals highly linear microstructures with main&#8208;chain ester functionality. Structure&#8208;performance studies indicate a strong correlation between axial steric hindrance and catalyst performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Neuropeptide Volume Transmission In Vivo by Simultaneous Near&#8208;Infrared Light Triggered Release and Optical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neuropeptides are abundant signaling molecules in the central nervous system. Yet remarkably little is known about their spatiotemporal spread and biological activity. Here, we developed an integrated optical approach using  P  lasmonic n  A  novesicles and cell&#8208;based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (  C  NiF  E  R), or PACE, to probe neuropeptide signaling in the mouse neocortex. Small volumes (fL to pL) of exogenously supplied somatostatin&#8208;14 (SST) can be rapidly released under near&#8208;infrared light stimulation from nanovesicles implanted in the brain and detected by SST2 CNiFERs with nM sensitivity. Our measurements reveal reduced but synchronized SST transmission within 130 &#956;m, and markedly smaller and delayed transmission at longer distances. These measurements enabled a quantitative estimation of the SST loss rate due to peptide degradation and binding. PACE offers a new tool for determining the spatiotemporal scales of neuropeptide volume transmission and signaling in the brain.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Scissoring Strategy Enables Precise Shaping of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Chromatographic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise shaping of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is significant in both fundamental coordination chemistry and practical applications, such as catalysis, separation, and biomedicine. Here, we demonstrated a linker scissoring strategy for precisely shaping MOFs through surface conformational pairing. In this strategy, the bidentate linkers which were designed according to the original tetratopic ligands and the coordination environment of MOF surfaces, were utilized as the covering agents. The shape of these covering agents and the surface conformation of metals onto MOFs restricted them to coordinate on the specific MOF facets thus precisely controlling the shape of MOFs. Different shapes of PCN&#8208;608 from nanoplate (PCN&#8208;NP) to nanorod (PCN&#8208;NR) have been targeted by adding different bidentate linkers, respectively. The universality of this strategy was demonstrated by controlling the shapes of the NU&#8208;MOFs from nanoplate to nanorod. This linker scissoring strategy provides a new guiding principle to synthesize MOF nanocrystals with controlled shapes.</dc:description>

The universality of this strategy was demonstrated by controlling the shapes of the NU-MOFs from nanoplate to nanorod. This linker scissoring strategy provides a new guiding principle to synthesize MOF nanocrystals with controlled shapes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nostovalerolactones are a novel class of cyanobacterial natural products that are derived from a tetronate&#8208;like biosynthesis pathway and team up with nostoclides to orchestrate the specialized metabolism in a symbiotic cyanobacterium. The data show how an understanding of regulation can be used to achieve high&#8208;titer production of bioactive specialized metabolites in cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density&#8208;dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain Nostoc punctiforme, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high&#8208;titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 Phosphors via Te4+ Sensitization</title>

A new class of NIR emitters was developed based on tellurium and lanthanide co&#8208;doped perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence from Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was achieved upon excitation with a near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;derivative metal halides have shown great promise in optoelectronics, however, it remains challenging to realize efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence in these materials. Herein, we report a novel strategy based on Te4+/Ln3+ (Ln=Er, Nd, and Yb) co&#8208;doping to achieve efficient NIR luminescence in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors, which are excitable by a low&#8208;cost near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chip. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence originating from the 4f&#8594;4f transitions of Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was acquired, with a quantum yield of 6.1&#8201;% for the Er3+ emission. These findings provide a general approach to achieve efficient NIR emission in lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal and lanthanide ion co&#8208;doping, thereby opening up a new avenue for exploring NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite derivatives towards versatile applications such as NIR&#8208;LEDs and bioimaging.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Biomarker&#8208;Regulated Photodynamic and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe is developed to turn on its near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signal for real&#8208;time imaging. Additionally, the probe can activate photodynamic therapy in response to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase in the tumor periphery and switch to photothermal therapy triggered by nitroreductase in the hypoxic tumor core.







Abstract
Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor&#8208;periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor&#8208;core&#8208;hypoxia biomarker. This PDT&#8208;PTT auto&#8208;regulated probe exhibits complete tumor ablation under the photoirradiation of a single laser source by producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen at the tumor periphery and generating hyperthermia at tumor&#8208;core where is too hypoxic for PDT. This dual&#8208;locked probe represents a promising molecular design approach toward precise cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>Tuning Surface&#8208;Electron Spins on Fe3O4 (111) through Chemisorption of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The way that CO adsorption affects the ground state magnetic ordering for a typical magnetic surface Fe3O4 (111) has been effectively demonstrated using a genetic algorithm magnetic order searching approach. As CO adsorption is increased, there is a gradual destabilization of the magnetic moment with an abrupt increase of the magnetic entropy due to the surface existing at a nearly degenerate magnetic state.







Abstract
The adsorption&#8208;induced flip of electron spin at interfaces is an important but poorly understood phenomenon for magnetic devices, sensors, and heterogeneous catalysis, due to the difficulties in determining the surface spins at atomic resolution. We present an evolutionary magnetic order searching method that allows efficient identification of the ground state spin configuration of magnetic bulk and surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered for the first time a set of adsorption&#8208;induced near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states on the Fe3O4 (111) surface. Molecular adsorption of CO causes a destabilization of the magnetic states of the clean surface leading to a set of near&#8208;degenerate surface magnetic states at medium coverage, which causes an abrupt increase of the magnetic entropy on the surface. The empty 2&#960;* orbital of CO, which could accommodate the back donation of the spin density in the Fe d orbitals, plays a key role for the CO adsorption&#8208;induced spin transition.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes in Water: Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Stereoregular Telechelic Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of phenylacetylenes in water was achieved by the development of a water&#8208;soluble rhodium&#8208;based multicomponent catalytic system. The obtained water&#8208;soluble polymers have high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The present polymerization method enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends and the synthesis of novel block copolymers in water.







Abstract
Well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of water&#8208;soluble phenylacetylene derivatives in water was achieved for the first time using a multicomponent catalytic system consisting of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, an aryl boronic acid, diphenylacetylene having carboxy groups, a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and a water&#8208;soluble triphenylphosphine. This catalytic system enables a direct synthesis of various water&#8208;soluble cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene)s having a narrow molecular weight distribution, the molecular weight of which can be controlled by the initial feed ratio of the monomer to the catalyst. Moreover, the syntheses of water&#8208;soluble telechelic poly(phenylacetylene)s having various functional groups at both chain ends as well as a water&#8208;soluble block copolymer were achieved.

&lt;p&gt;Living polymerization of phenylacetylenes in water was achieved by the development of a water-soluble rhodium-based multicomponent catalytic system. The obtained water-soluble polymers have high &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-stereoregularity and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The present polymerization method enables control of molecular weights of the polymers and functionalization of both polymer chain ends and the synthesis of novel block copolymers in water.

         <title>Photothermal Nanoconfinement Reactor: Boosting Chemical Reactivity with Locally High Temperature in a Confined Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) comprised of hollow carbon nanospheres boosts the overall chemical reaction rate of an otherwise large reaction volume during peroxydisulfate&#8208;mediated oxidation of micropollutants. The reaction pathway, which would ordinarily involve radical species, is directed through a non&#8208;radical pathway because of the local heat in the nanoconfined space.







Abstract
A photothermal nanoconfinement reactor (PNCR) system is proposed and demonstrated by using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) to enhance the performance of the chemical reaction. Under light irradiation, the local temperature of the HCN inner void space was much higher than the bulk solution temperature because the confined space concentrates heat and inhibits heat loss. Using the temperature&#8208;sensitive model reaction, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation to oxidize micropollutant, it is shown that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole in the PNCR system is 7.1&#8197;times of that without nanoconfinement. It is further discovered that the high&#8208;quality local heat inside the nanoconfined space shifted the model reaction from an otherwise non&#8208;radical pathway to a radical&#8208;based pathway. This work provides an interesting strategy to produce a locally high temperature, which has a wide range of applications to energy and environmental fields.

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic biochemical machinery for information processing and communication is essential for the construction of artificial protocells with complex dynamic behaviors. Here we use synthetic transcriptional circuits to produce diffusive RNA signal that can regulate CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing and localization in a binary community of synthetic protocells.







Abstract
Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer a transcriptional module to generate RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.

         <title>Chemiexcitation&#8208;Triggered Prodrug Activation for Targeted Carbon Monoxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new prodrug strategy, namely chemiexcitation triggered prodrug activation, is proposed herein to achieve targeted CO delivery to the tumor site. The CO release from a photoresponsive CO prodrug is activated by chemical energy transfer instead of by UV irradiation. As such, the inherent limitations with light irradiation are perfectly addressed.







Abstract
Photolysis&#8208;based prodrug strategy can address some critical drug delivery issues, which otherwise are very challenging to tackle with traditional prodrug strategy. However, the need for external light irradiation significantly hampers its in vivo application due to the poor light accessibility of deep tissue. Herein, we propose a new strategy of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation, wherein a photoresponsive prodrug is excited for drug payload release by chemiexcitation instead of photoirradiation. As such, the bond&#8208;cleavage power of photolysis can be employed to address some critical drug delivery issues while obviating the need for external light irradiation. We have established the proof of concept by the successful development of a chemiexcitation responsive carbon monoxide delivery platform, which exhibited specific CO release at the tumor site and pronounced tumor suppression effects. We anticipate that such a concept of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation can be leveraged for the targeted delivery of other small molecule&#8208;based drug payloads.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Under Visible Light Enabled by a Particulate Conjugated Polymer Loaded with Palladium and Iridium
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone) loaded with Pd/IrO2 facilitates stoichiometric overall water splitting for an extended period after the system stabilized, albeit currently with low activities. The study demonstrates the importance of co&#8208;catalysts for polymer photoatalysts and results were rationalized by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60&#8197;hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: A Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.







Abstract
Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl&#8208;magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me2Si(C13H8)2)Nd(&#956;&#8208;BH4)[(&#956;&#8208;BH4)Li(THF)]}2 metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP.

     alt="Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: A Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl-magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Nd(&#956;-BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)[(&#956;-BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Li(THF)]}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP. Hard and soft blocks such as PB, polystyrene (PS), poly(styrene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-butadiene) (SBR) obtained by anionic polymerization and PE or poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-butadiene) (EBR) produced by CCT(co)P were combined and the corresponding structures were characterized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion&#8208;paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bound Inward&#8208;Growth of Artificial Cytoskeletons and Their Selective Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth strategy is presented to construct membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs) consisting of convergent&#8208;arranged nanofibers grown from a capsule membrane. Furthermore, this method enables the light&#8208;controlled integration of dynamic covalent bonds into the MAC and to realize two modes of selective disassembly behaviors.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is one of the most important cellular components. Up to now, most of the reported artificial cytoskeletons are based on a gel&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle strategy. Herein, we report a membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth pathway to prepare cytoskeleton&#8208;like and radially aligned nanofibers grown from capsule membranes to get membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs). The mechanism therein is disclosed through the direct observation of the intermediates in both dried and liquid states. Furthermore, the as&#8208;prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work provides a new hierarchical self&#8208;assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.

Chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route, which provides a powerful driving force, abundant atomic&#8208;level charge flow highways and a decreased energy barrier for directional migration and spatial separation of photocharges, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity for selective photo&#8208;oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Inferior contact interface and low charge transfer efficiency seriously restrict the performance of heterojunctions. Herein, chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the internal electric field provides a powerful driving force for vectorial migration of photocharges between Bi4MO8Cl and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, and the interfacial Fe&#8722;O bond not only serves as an atomic&#8208;level charge flow highway but also lowers the charge transfer energy barrier, thereby accelerating Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and realizing effective spatial charge separation. Impressively, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl manifests a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes (Con. &#8805;92&#8201;%, Sel. &#8805;96&#8201;%), with a performance improvement of one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents atomic&#8208;level insight into interfacial charge flow steering.

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining feedback (FB) and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current (AC) SECM methodologies is proposed as a unique approach that provides the two essential properties namely the ionic and electronic conductivity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li&#8208;ion batteries quantitatively. The influence of the electrolyte composition and the SEI formation protocol on the properties of the resulting SEI was derived.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insulating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.

A general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine is reported. Amongst lead compounds, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent nanomolar inhibition against endogenous ABL kinase, with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets.







Abstract
Despite recent interests in developing lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, no general approach is available to create such compounds. We report herein a general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine residue using key SuFEx and salicylaldehyde&#8208;based imine chemistries. We validated the strategy by successfully developing (irreversible and reversible) covalent inhibitors against BCR&#8208;ABL kinase. Our lead compounds showed high levels of selectivity in biochemical assays, exhibited nanomolar potency against endogenous ABL kinase in cellular assays, and were active against most drug&#8208;resistant ABL mutations. Among them, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent ABL inhibition with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets in K562 cells. Bioinformatics further suggested the generality of our strategy against the human kinome.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine Controls K+ Channel Transport and Induces Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the functions of biological motors, a light&#8208;driven motor molecule was designed that inserts into the lipid membrane and transports ions with high ion selectivity and gating function. The light&#8208;driven motor rotation accelerates K+ efflux and induces caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells.







Abstract
The design of artificial ion channels with high activity, selectivity and gating function is challenging. Herein, we designed the light&#8208;driven motor molecule MC2, which provides new design criteria to overcome these challenges. MC2 forms a selective K+ channel through a single molecular transmembrane mechanism, and the light&#8208;driven rotary motion significantly accelerates ion transport, which endows the irradiated motor molecule with excellent cytotoxicity and cancer cell selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the rotary motion of MC2 promotes K+ efflux, generates reactive oxygen species and eventually activates caspase&#8208;3&#8208;dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Combined with the spatiotemporally controllable advantages of light, we believe this strategy can be exploited in the structural design and application of next&#8208;generation synthetic cation transporters for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Alteration of the Catalytic Reaction Trajectory of a Vicinal Oxygen Chelate Enzyme by Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of ChaP, a novel vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme, afforded bifunctional enzymes designated as &#8220;ChaP variants&#8221;, which catalyzed regioselective intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylation of the ring&#8208;opened molecules. This activity expands the VOC catalytic repertoire to bring us closer to artificial VOC enzymes of broad biotechnological significance.







Abstract
The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily catalyzes a highly diverse set of reactions with the mechanism characterized by the bidentate coordination of vicinal oxygen atoms to metal ion centers, but there remains a lack of a platform to steer the reaction trajectories, especially for o&#8208;quinone metabolizing pathways. Herein, we present the directed&#8208;evolution&#8208;enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone cleavage and concomitant &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol&#8208;like o&#8208;quinone deconstruction and CO2 liberation from the resulting o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity. Enzyme crystal structures, labeling experiments and computational simulations corroborated that the D49L mutation allows the metal ion to change its coordination with the tyrosine phenoxy atoms in different monomers, thereby altering the reaction trajectory with the regiospecificity further improved by the follow&#8208;up replacement of the Y92 residue with any of alanine, glycine, threonine, and serine. The study highlights the unpredicted catalytic versatility and enzymatic plasticity of VOC enzymes with biotechnological significance.

A new acceptor core, obtained by fusing dithiafulvalene with benzothiadiazole, was utilized to construct near&#8208;infrared AIEgen luminophores, in which TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm in the solid state and featured a high quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. The doped and non&#8208;doped NIR OLEDs achieved excellent external quantum efficiencies of 14.3&#8201;% and 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 750 and 804&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens have attracted intensive attention considering their vast potential applications in areas like bioimaging, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and night&#8208;vision telecommunication. However, organic NIR luminogens with high solid quantum efficiencies are scarce, limiting their applications. Here, we reported an electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, BSM, based on dithiafulvalene and benzothiadiazole, which could work as a strong acceptor to produce highly efficient NIR emitters with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. One of the AIEgens, TBSMCN emitted at 820&#8197;nm with a solid quantum yield of 10.7&#8201;%. When applied to solution&#8208;processed OLEDs, an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.4&#8201;% was achieved with a peak wavelength at 728&#8197;nm. Moreover, its non&#8208;doped device could achieve an extraordinary EQE of 2.2&#8201;% peaking at 804&#8197;nm. In the further optimized configuration, when an extra sensitizer was added to harvest triplet excitons, the EQE unprecedentedly soared up to 14.3&#8201;% with a peak wavelength of 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Cluster Assisted Fabrication of a Defect&#8208;Rich Ti&#8208;MOF Membrane Showing Versatile Gas&#8208;Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the titanium&#8208;oxo cluster Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 as the titanium source, a MIL&#8208;125 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane was prepared under mild reaction conditions through combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth. Using this titanium source and maintaining a lower reaction temperature increased the missing&#8208;linker number in the MIL&#8208;125 framework and therefore enhanced the CO2/N2 selectivity.







Abstract
Although having shown great promise for efficient gas separation, relevant study of Ti&#8208;MOF membranes remains very scarce, owing to limited Ti source types and uncertain factors which dominate the separation properties. In this work, we pioneered the use of the Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 cluster as the Ti source of MIL&#8208;125 membranes, which led to lower reaction temperature and higher missing&#8208;linker number within the framework and therefore, enhanced CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity. The MIL&#8208;125 membrane prepared by combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth displayed an ideal CO2/N2 selectivity of 38.7, which ranked the highest among all pristine pure MOF membranes measured under comparable conditions. In addition, the ideal H2/N2 and H2/CH4 selectivity was as high as 64.9 and 40.7, thus showing great promise for versatile utility in gas separation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although having shown great promise for efficient gas separation, relevant study of Ti-MOF membranes remains very scarce, owing to limited Ti source types and uncertain factors which dominate the separation properties. In this work, we pioneered the use of the Ti&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(OOCC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; cluster as the Ti source of MIL-125 membranes, which led to lower reaction temperature and higher missing-linker number within the framework and therefore, enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption selectivity. The MIL-125 membrane prepared by combining single-mode microwave heating with tertiary growth displayed an ideal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 38.7, which ranked the highest among all pristine pure MOF membranes measured under comparable conditions. In addition, the ideal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity was as high as 64.9 and 40.7, thus showing great promise for versatile utility in gas separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase by Electrolyte Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is successfully constructed on LiCoO2 cathode by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at 1.7&#8197;V. LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration and Co dissolution during cycling at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V, demonstrating an excellent cyclability with high capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5C.







Abstract
The capacity of transition metal oxide cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries can be further enhanced by increasing the charging potential. However, these high voltage cathodes suffer from fast capacity decay because the large volume change of cathode breaks the active materials and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), resulting in electrolyte penetration into broken active materials and continuous side reactions between cathode and electrolytes. Herein, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI was formed by potentiostatic reduction of fluorinated electrolyte at a low potential of 1.7&#8197;V. By taking LiCoO2 as a model cathode, we demonstrate that the LiF&#8208;rich CEI maintains the structural integrity and suppresses electrolyte penetration at a high cut&#8208;off potential of 4.6&#8197;V. The LiCoO2 with LiF&#8208;rich CEI exhibited a capacity of 198&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C and an enhanced capacity retention of 63.5&#8201;% over 400&#8197;cycles as compared to the LiF&#8208;free LiCoO2 with only 17.4&#8201;% of capacity retention.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols: A Remarkable Macrocyclic Ligand Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of Mn&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of allylic alcohols is described by using a chiral peraza N6&#8208;macrocyclic ligand. DFT calculations revealed that multiple noncovalent interactions existed among the ligand, solvent, and substrate in the transition states, showing a remarkable macrocyclic ligand effect.







Abstract
A unique family of chiral peraza N6&#8208;macrocyclic ligands, which are conformationally rigid and have a tunable saddle&#8208;shaped cavity, is described. Utilizing their manganese(I) complexes, the first example of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of allylic alcohols was realized, providing a practical access to synthetically important chiral &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;% ee). The single&#8208;crystal structure of a MnI complex indicates that the manganese atom coordinates with the chiral dialkylamine moiety in a bidentate fashion. Further DFT calculations revealed that five of the six nitrogen atoms in the ligand were engaged in multiple noncovalent interactions with Mn, an isopropanol molecule, and a &#946;&#8208;amino ketone intermediate via coordination, hydrogen bonding, and/or CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the transition state, showing a remarkable role of the macrocyclic framework.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Metastable Species in Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented mechanism for the supramolecular polymerization (SP) of H&#8208;bonding synthons has been unravelled. Remarkably, a new on&#8208;pathway metastable dimer state (D*) incorporating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8208;bonds was discovered that allows spatiotemporal and length control of the SP through a consecutive mechanism.







Abstract
We reveal unique hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding patterns and exploit them to control the kinetics, pathways and length of supramolecular polymers (SPs). New bisamide&#8208;containing monomers were designed to elucidate the role of competing intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions on the kinetics of supramolecular polymerization (SP). Remarkably, two polymerization&#8208;inactive metastable states were discovered. Contrary to previous examples, the commonly assumed intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded monomer does not evolve into intermolecularly H&#8208;bonded SPs via ring opening, but rather forms a metastable dimer. In this dimer, all H&#8208;bonding sites are saturated, either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly, hampering elongation. The dimers exhibit an advantageous preorganization, which upon opening of the intramolecular portion of the H&#8208;bonding motif facilitates SP in a consecutive process. The retardation of spontaneous self&#8208;assembly as a result of two metastable states enables length control in SP by seed&#8208;mediated growth.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Management for High&#8208;Temperature Mesoporous SnO2 Electron Transport Layers in Printable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies (OVs) were managed by the lattice Mg and the interstitial Mg which modulated the formation and ionization of OVs for self&#8208;doping in SnO2. OV management optimized the capability of high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 to serve as well&#8208;performed ETLs for printable PSCs with efficiency enhanced from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed to the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the high&#8208;temperature mesoporous SnO2 ETL (mp&#8208;SnO2) brings poor device performance. Herein, we report the application of mp&#8208;SnO2 for efficient printable PSCs via oxygen vacancy (OV) management by introducing magnesium (Mg) into the paste. We find that high&#8208;temperature annealing suppresses self&#8208;doping of SnO2 by reducing OVs. The introduced Mg occupies both the Sn site and interstitial site of SnO2 and promotes the formation of OVs. Lattice Mg tends to induce neutral OVs and interstitial Mg could promote the ionization of neutral OVs for self&#8208;doping. The synergy effect on OVs increases the carrier density and upshifts the Fermi level energy of mp&#8208;SnO2, ensuring its capability as the well&#8208;performed ETL with trap&#8208;less charge transport and suppressed surface recombination for dramatic improved device PCE from 6.62&#8201;% to 17.25&#8201;%.

         <title>Sequential Allylic Alcohol Formation by a Multifunctional Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Monooxygenase with Rare Redox Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional cytochrome&#8197;P450 monoxygenase CayG plays a key role in the biosynthesis of the cytotoxic fatty acid caryoynencin in pathogenic bacteria. CayG promotes an unusual desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence to install an allylic alcohol with the help of rare ferredoxin/rubredoxin redox partners. This enzyme system may inspire new multifunctional (bio)catalysts for regio&#8208; and stereoselective modifications of saturated carbon backbones.







Abstract
Caryoynencin is a toxic and antifungal fatty acid derivative produced by a number of plant&#8208;pathogenic and insect&#8208;protective bacteria (Trinickia caryophylli and Burkholderia spp.). In addition to the reactive tetrayne unit, the presence of an allylic alcohol moiety is critical for antimicrobial activities. By a combination of mutational analyses, heterologous expression and in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that the cytochrome&#8197;P450 monooxygenase CayG catalyzes the complex transformation of a saturated carbon backbone into an allylic alcohol. Unexpectedly, CayG employs a ferritin&#8208;like protein (CayK) or a rubredoxin (CayL) component for electron transport. A desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence was deduced from a time&#8208;course study and in vitro biotransformations with pathway intermediates, substrate analogues, protegencin congeners from Pseudomonas protegens Pf&#8208;5, and synthetic derivatives. This unusual multifunctional oxygenase may inspire future biocatalytic applications.

         <title>In Situ Prodrug Activation by an Affibody&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyst Hybrid for HER2&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid (Ru&#8208;HER2) binds to the HER2 receptor on cancer cells and catalyzes the in situ activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced anticancer activity via the synergism between the HER2 signaling pathway blockade and gemcitabine&#8208;induced DNA damage. Therefore, the catalytic chemotherapy selectively inhibits the growth of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells and significantly reduces the side effects to normal cells.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysts exhibit great potential as therapeutic agents to inhibit tumor growth. However, the precise delivery and in situ catalysis are challenging in catalytic medicine. Herein, we report an anti&#8208;HER2 affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid, named Ru&#8208;HER2 for selective and effective killing of cancer cells. Ru&#8208;HER2 binds to the HER2 receptor on a tumor cell and in situ catalyzes the activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced selectivity in suppression of tumor growth and reduction of side effects. Immunoblotting reveals that Ru&#8208;HER2 in combination with gemcitabine prodrug can not only induce DNA damage, but also effectively block the HER2 signaling pathway in cancer cells. Therefore, the HER2&#8208;targeted chemotherapy exhibits substantially high anticancer activity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In a word, we report the first affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid and reveal its potential for effective HER2&#8208;targeted cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>A Rare Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based on a Tailorable Mn8&#8208;Cluster Showing Smart Responsiveness to Aromatic Guests and Capacity for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extra degree of freedom to framework flexibility contributed by size&#8208; and shape&#8208;tailorable metal clusters is established, leading to three&#8208;dimensional variations of the framework that are smartly responsive to varied aromatic molecules.







Abstract
The design and creation of soft porous crystals combining regularity and flexibility may promote potential applications for gas storage and separation due to their deformable framework's responsiveness to external stimuli. The flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on alterable degrees of freedom that are mainly provided by organic linkers or the junctions linking organic and inorganic building units. Herein, we report a new dynamic MOF whose flexibility originates from an unprecedented tailorable Mn8O38&#8208;cluster and shows simultaneous coordination geometry changes and ligand migration that are reversibly driven by guest exchange. This provides an extra degree of freedom to the framework's deformation, resulting in three&#8208;dimensional variations in the framework that subtly respond to varied aromatic molecules. The gas adsorption behavior of this flexible MOF was evaluated, and the selective separation of light hydrocarbons and Freon gases is achieved.

Oxyfluorides are widely studied functional solids that show great potential as nonlinear optical materials, while only few examples with a wide bandgap exist. In their Communication (e202203104), Chao Wu, Chi Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;rich oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 by a fluorine&#8208;enrichment strategy. The crystalline oxyfluoride exhibits a wide bandgap and large second&#8208;harmonic generation response. The key role of the fluorine content in affecting the optical activity is disclosed.

In their Communication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202203104"&gt;(e202203104)&lt;/a&gt;, Chao Wu, Chi Zhang, and co-workers report the synthesis of a fluorine-rich oxyfluoride K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(NbOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(NbF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a fluorine-enrichment strategy. The crystalline oxyfluoride exhibits a wide bandgap and large second-harmonic generation response. The key role of the fluorine content in affecting the optical activity is disclosed.

Enantioenriched chromanone lactones were prepared by copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, as reported by Jin Cui, Masakatsu Shibasaki, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202203128). The catalytic system features the use of chiral ligands to control the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective addition of copper vinylogous enolates to chromones. The cover illustrates superimposed product structures, dropping a hint about the ligand&#8208;controlled diastereodivergence.

Radiation damage in the form of radical formation by homolytic Se&#8722;C bond cleavage was trapped by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray and EPR experiments, as reported by Dietmar Stalke and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202203665). Orange dibenzyl diselenide single crystals were exposed to X&#8208;rays with various intensities, and the benzyl radical formation was monitored by multipole refinement and quantum/molecular mechanics. In any interpretation of selenium&#8208;containing structures, particularly in life science experiments from synchrotrons, it is important to consider those radical&#8208;induced processes.

The development, roles, and applications of enzymes in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) are summarized in this Minireview. A reflection on the challenges and future directions of this promising field are also given.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis has been increasingly utilized in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) on account of its mildness, efficiency, and sustainability. In this Minireview we discuss the key roles enzymes play in RDRP, including their ATRPase, initiase, deoxygenation, and photoenzyme activities. We use selected examples to highlight applications of Enz&#8208;RDRP in surface brush fabrication, sensing, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, and high&#8208;throughput synthesis. We also give our reflections on the challenges and future directions of this emerging area.

         <title>Superchaotropic Boron Clusters as Membrane Carriers for the Transport of Hydrophilic Cargos</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers abandoned the typical amphiphilic model of membrane transport and proposed a new chaotrope&#8208;mediated transport principle. They utilized superchaotropic boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. This groundbreaking work is a conceptual innovation and may have a profound impact on cell&#8208;biological, neurobiological, physiological, and pharmaceutical studies.







Abstract
Design of membrane transporters is important in pharmaceutical drug delivery and bioimaging. Traditionally, the amphiphilic transport mechanism has governed the design of membrane carriers over the last 50&#8197;years. Recently, Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers discarded classical amphiphilic models and proposed a new transport principle based on the chaotropic effect. They utilized globular boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. Herein, we highlight this recent pioneering work, which is a landmark for membrane transport.

&lt;p&gt;Montenegro, Nau and co-workers abandoned the typical amphiphilic model of membrane transport and proposed a new chaotrope-mediated transport principle. They utilized superchaotropic boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. This groundbreaking work is a conceptual innovation and may have a profound impact on cell-biological, neurobiological, physiological, and pharmaceutical studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design of membrane transporters is important in pharmaceutical drug delivery and bioimaging. Traditionally, the amphiphilic transport mechanism has governed the design of membrane carriers over the last 50&#8197;years. Recently, Montenegro, Nau and co-workers discarded classical amphiphilic models and proposed a new transport principle based on the chaotropic effect. They utilized globular boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. Herein, we highlight this recent pioneering work, which is a landmark for membrane transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical versatility of sulfur allows the formation of several dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs). This Review summarizes the advances achieved with each DSB, together with some applications. In addition, dynamic multilevel systems in which two or more DSBs are combined in the same system are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur has been important in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) since the beginning of the field. Mainly as part of disulfides and thioesters, dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs) have a leading role in several remarkable reactions. Part of this success is due to the almost ideal properties of DSBs for the preparation of dynamic covalent systems, including high reactivity and good reversibility under mild aqueous conditions, the possibility of exploiting supramolecular interactions, access to isolable structures, and easy experimental control to turn the reaction on/off. DCC is currently witnessing an increase in the importance of DSBs. The chemical flexibility offered by DSBs opens the door to multiple applications. This Review presents an overview of all the DSBs used in DCC, their applications, and remarks on the interesting properties that they confer on dynamic chemical systems, especially those containing several DSBs.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Evolution of G Protein&#8208;Biased &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
cryoEM structures of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) bound to the lead compound PZM21 and the newly developed agonist FH210 were obtained to understand the mechanism of their biased signaling and to guide the evolution of next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.







Abstract
The &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor (&#956;OR) is the major target for opioid analgesics. Activation of &#956;OR initiates signaling through G protein pathways as well as through &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment. &#956;OR agonists that are biased towards G protein signaling pathways demonstrate diminished side effects. PZM21, discovered by computational docking, is a G protein biased &#956;OR agonist. Here we report the cryoEM structure of PZM21 bound &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein. Structure&#8208;based evolution led to multiple PZM21 analogs with more pronounced Gi protein bias and increased lipophilicity to improve CNS penetration. Among them, FH210 shows extremely low potency and efficacy for arrestin recruitment. We further determined the cryoEM structure of FH210 bound to &#956;OR in complex with Gi protein and confirmed its expected binding pose. The structural and pharmacological studies reveal a potential mechanism to reduce &#946;&#8208;arrestin recruitment by the &#956;OR, and hold promise for developing next&#8208;generation analgesics with fewer adverse effects.

         <title>Electronic Regulation of Nickel Single Atoms by Confined Nickel Nanoparticles for Energy&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst was developed. With electron donation from the Ni nanoparticle to single atoms via a carbon network, the catalyst achieves a high CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V with an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;% for electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of atomically dispersed active sites is promising to boost catalytic activity but is challenging to achieve. Here we show a cooperative Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;nanoparticle catalyst (NiSA/NP) prepared via direct solid&#8208;state pyrolysis, where Ni nanoparticles donate electrons to Ni(i)&#8722;N&#8722;C sites via a network of carbon nanotubes, achieving a high CO current density of 346&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs RHE in an alkaline flow cell. When coupled with a NiFe&#8208;based anode in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrolyzer, the catalyst delivers an industrially relevant CO current density of 310&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V, corresponding to an overall energy efficiency of 57&#8201;%. The superior CO2 electroreduction performance is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of key intermediate COOH* on the electron&#8208;rich Ni single atoms, as well as a high density of active sites.

         <title>Modular Introduction of endo&#8208;Binding Sites in a Macrocyclic Cavity towards Selective Recognition of Neutral Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles with functionalized interiors are relatively hard to synthesize. Here, a versatile and modular strategy to customize endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity is reported. This new family of macrocyclic receptors, with diverse binding sites across the inner surface, exhibit well&#8208;defined structures, facile post&#8208; and pre&#8208;modification, and excellent host&#8211;guest recognition.







Abstract
Macrocycles with a functionalized interior, which is a general cavity feature of bioreceptors, are relatively hard to synthesize. Here we report a modular strategy to customize diverse endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity. Only two steps are needed. First, one V&#8208;shaped functional module bearing an embedded binding site and two 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls as reaction modules are connected. Then the condensation of the resulting monomer and paraformaldehyde directly produces the designed macrocycle. V&#8208;shaped monomers are deliberately used to guarantee the binding sites equatorially directing inward into the cavity and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls standing axially as macrocycle sidewalls. More than a dozen endo&#8208;functionalized macrocyclic receptors have been constructed. Host&#8211;guest complexation studies show that macrocycle BP1&#8208;decorated interior OH moieties can strongly encapsulate neutral azacycles by forming inner hydrogen bonds, giving a high association constant of 4.59&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>Activation of Main&#8208;Group Antimony Atomic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single antimony sites functionalized by epoxy groups in N&#8208;doped graphene were designed to activate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electron&#8208;rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of the Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties, optimizing the adsorption of the intermediates to approach the top of the volcano plot. This discovery provides new way to improve the catalytic activity of main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of main&#8208;group metal is hard to promote because of the intrinsic lack of host d orbitals available to be combined. Herein, under the guidance of theoretical predictions, we find atom&#8208;dispersed antimony sites (Sb&#8722;N4 moieties) can be activated to achieve high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity using a functional group regulation strategy. Correspondingly, we manage to synthesize a main&#8208;group Sb single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that comprises Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties functionalized by epoxy groups in the second microenvironment and incorporated in N&#8208;doped graphene (Sb1/NG(O)). The electron&#8208;rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of Sb&#8722;N4 active moieties, thereby optimizing the adsorption of the intermediate. The Sb SACs are comparable to industrial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. This discovery provides new opportunities to manipulate and improve the catalytic activity of main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Single antimony sites functionalized by epoxy groups in N-doped graphene were designed to activate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The electron-rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of the Sb&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active moieties, optimizing the adsorption of the intermediates to approach the top of the volcano plot. This discovery provides new way to improve the catalytic activity of main-group-element electrocatalysts.

         <title>Sulfate&#8208;Enabled Nitrate Synthesis from Nitrogen Electrooxidation on a Rhodium Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfate is demonstrated to enhance the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) over an Rh electrocatalyst. A series of electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations show that sulfate promotes nitrogen chemical adsorption and NO intermediate formation. Theoretical calculations further reveal that sulfate enhances nitrogen adsorption and reduces the reaction energy barrier and activation energy of nitrogen oxidation.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to generate nitrate is gaining increasing attention as an alternative approach to the conventional industrial manufacture. But, current progress in NOR is limited by the difficulties in activation and conversion of the strong N&#8801;N bond (941&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Herein, we designed to utilize sulfate to enhance NOR performance over an Rh electrocatalyst. After the addition of sulfate, the inert Rh nanoparticles exhibited superior NOR performance with a nitrate yield of 168.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The 15N isotope&#8208;labeling experiment confirmed the produced nitrate from nitrogen electrooxidation. A series of electrochemical in&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical calculation unveiled that sulfate promoted nitrogen adsorption and decreased the reaction energy barrier, and in situ formed sulfate radicals reduced the activation energy of the potential&#8208;determining step, thus accelerating NOR.

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation/kinetic resolution provides access to anti&#8208;configured terminal epoxy alcohols with high selectivity, no analogous syn&#8208;selective epoxidation process has been available. We report that this &#8220;missing link&#8221; is provided by a readily available titanium salalen catalyst. Besides allylic alcohols, allylic ethers are epoxidized with extreme syn&#8208;selectivity, at low catalyst loading, with aqueous H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20&#8201;:&#8201;1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereocenters, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.

         <title>Enhancing Metalating Efficiency of the Sodium Amide NaTMP in Arene Borylation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;nucleophilic amide NaTMP, in combination with PMDETA and B(OiPr)3 have allowed the deprotonative borylation of unactivated arenes under mild conditions. The study of its reaction pathway and the characterisation of the intermediates by X&#8208;Ray crystallography and 1H DOSY enabled the development of this protocol, which forms boronates in a direct and easy way, enabling Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings to obtain biaryls in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Though LiTMP (TMP=2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) is a commonly used amide, surprisingly the heavier NaTMP has hardly been utilised. Here, by mixing NaTMP with tridentate donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), we provide structural, and mechanistic insights into the sodiation of non&#8208;activated arenes (e.g. anisole and benzene). While these reactions are low yielding, adding B(OiPr)3 has a profound effect, not only by intercepting the CAr&#8208;Na bond, but also by driving the metalation reaction towards quantitative formation of more stabilized sodium aryl boronates. Demonstrating its metalating power, regioselective C2&#8208;metalation/borylation of naphthalene has been accomplished contrasting with single&#8208;metal based protocols which are unselective and low yielding. Extension to other arenes allows for in situ generation of aryl boronates which can then directly engage in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings, furnishing a range of biaryls in a selective and efficient manner.

         <title>Anisotropy in a 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Drives Self&#8208;Powered Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photoresponse for Ultraviolet Solar&#8208;Blind Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind polarized&#8208;light detection has been demonstrated for the first time in a new wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite&#8208;type ferroelectric and closely involves the inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect.







Abstract
Polarized&#8208;light detection in the deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which the BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (&#8776;15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (&#8776;3.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, under 266&#8197;nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (&#8776;103) and polarization ratio (&#8776;2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.

This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alumina&#8208;Supported Alpha&#8208;Iron(III) Oxyhydroxide as a Recyclable Solid Catalyst for CO2 Photoreduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread soil mineral, alpha&#8208;iron(III) oxyhydroxide, which is loaded onto an alumina support, works as a recyclable catalyst for CO2 reduction. In the presence of a RuII photosensitizer, the catalyst produces formic acid with 80&#8211;90&#8201;% selectivity and an apparent quantum yield of 4.3&#8201;% at 460&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into transportable fuels such as formic acid (HCOOH) under sunlight is an attractive solution to the shortage of energy and carbon resources as well as to the increase in Earth's atmospheric CO2 concentration. The use of abundant elements as the components of a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system is important, and a solid catalyst that is active, recyclable, nontoxic, and inexpensive is strongly demanded. Here, we show that a widespread soil mineral, alpha&#8208;iron(III) oxyhydroxide (&#945;&#8208;FeOOH; goethite), loaded onto an Al2O3 support, functions as a recyclable catalyst for a photocatalytic CO2 reduction system under visible light (&#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm) in the presence of a RuII photosensitizer and an electron donor. This system gave HCOOH as the main product with 80&#8211;90&#8201;% selectivity and an apparent quantum yield of 4.3&#8201;% at 460&#8197;nm, as confirmed by isotope tracer experiments with 13CO2. The present work shows that the use of a proper support material is another method of catalyst activation toward the selective reduction of CO2.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylation and Alkene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8722;NiI catalyst promotes regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides to afford trisubstituted borylalkenes and styrenes. The reaction proceeds through branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation followed by trans&#8208;selective allyl isomerization.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;NiI catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing trans alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by trans&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate) Using a Di&#8208;MgII Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) to cyclohexene oxide (CHO) with 98&#8201;% selectivity using a dinuclear MgII catalyst is reported. The chemical recycling and recovery of CHO under mild conditions further advances the utilization of CO2&#8208;polycarbonates as recyclable materials.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to true monomers is pivotal for a circular plastics economy. Here, the first catalyzed chemical recycling of the widely investigated carbon dioxide derived polymer, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), to cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide is reported. The reaction requires dinuclear catalysis, with the di&#8208;MgII catalyst showing both high monomer selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and activity (TOF=150&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.33&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 120&#8201;&#176;C). The depolymerization occurs via a chain&#8208;end catalyzed depolymerization mechanism and DFT calculations indicate the high selectivity arises from Mg&#8208;alkoxide catalyzed epoxide extrusion being kinetically favorable compared to cyclic carbonate formation.

         <title>Repeatedly Regenerating Mechanically Robust Polymer Brushes from Persistent Initiator Coating (PIC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic&#8208;hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) was fabricated by the introduction of initiator into a mechanically robust sol&#8208;gel layer for surface initiated polymerization. This strategy enables polymerization repeatedly when polymer brushes on the surface were worn off and both PIC and surface grafted brushes show excellent anti&#8208;abrasive property compared to conventional brushes.







Abstract
In this study, a novel surface initiated polymerization (SIP) method was developed from organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid persistent initiator coating (PIC) that embeds initiator molecules into inorganic silica sol&#8208;gel layer. Comparing with traditional silane initiator surface that prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, the PIC can effectively improve the mechanical stability of initiator that was able to endure ten&#8208;thousand times of friction cycles. Besides, it allows polymer grafting from sub&#8208;surface and so the grafted brushes, poly 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (pSPMA) on the PIC were also much more wear&#8208;resisting than those prepared by the traditional ways. More importantly, the PIC could still trigger new polymerization reaction when the grafted brushes were worn off. In addition, the PIC is universal and can be covered on different substrates including glass, metals and plastics, etc. to realize functionalization of these materials. The approach may pave technological way for the application of surface grafted polymer brushes.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Racemic Allylic Alcohols for the Synthesis of Chiral Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic allylic alcohols are converted into chiral amino acid derivatives via asymmetric hydroalkylation enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggested that a single ruthenium chiral catalyst controls the stereoselectivity of two remote chiral centers through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation and a diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.

Mechanistic studies suggested that a single ruthenium chiral catalyst controls the stereoselectivity of two remote chiral centers through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation and a diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transfer of Axial Chirality to the Nanoscale Endows Carbon Nanodots with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropoisomeric precursors have been employed to prepare chiral carbon dots using a straightforward bottom&#8208;up approach. Chirality is retained in the nanoparticle, endowing carbon nanodots with intrinsic circularly polarized luminescence. The obtained material combines chiroptical activity with excellent processability in organic solvents and thermal stability.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, purification and characterization of chiral carbon nanodots starting from atropoisomeric precursors. The obtained atropoisomeric carbon nanodots are soluble in organic solvents and have good thermal stability, which are desirable features for technological applications. The synthetic protocol is robust, as it supports a number of variations in terms of molecular doping agents. Remarkably, the combination of axially chiral precursors and 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone as doping agent results in green&#8208;emissive carbon dots displaying circularly polarized luminescence. Dissymmetry factors of |3.5|&#215;10&#8722;4 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality. Introducing axial chirality expands the strategies available to tailor the properties of carbon nanodots, paving the way for carbon nanoparticles that combine good processability in organic solvents with engineered advanced chiroptical properties.

         <title>Concise and Stereodivergent Approach to Chromanone Lactones through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition of Siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;Ester&#8208;Substituted Chromones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous addition of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones is described. This method generated enantioenriched chromanone lactones with divergent diastereoselectivities depending on the ligand used and enabled a concise and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Vicinal oxygen&#8208;containing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted stereocenters exist widely in chromanone lactone and tetrahydroxanthone natural products. Their enantioselective construction in a single step remains elusive and poses a formidable challenge for chemical synthesis. Here, we report the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric vinylogous additions of siloxyfurans to 2&#8208;ester&#8208;substituted chromones, which enable concise and enantioselective assembly of chromanone lactones. Both syn and anti adducts can be accessed with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity by judicious choice of the chiral ligands. Our approach allowed for the efficient synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;blennolide&#8197;B with precise stereochemical control, which provides a formal synthesis of secalonic acid&#8197;A.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Addition for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Pyrrolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis has been developed to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The chemistry, mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst, enables the synthesis of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones, with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.







Abstract
We report a catalytic asymmetric protocol for the preparation of chiral pyrrolidinones proceeding via a radical pathway. The chemistry exploits the combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The reaction is initiated by photoredox activation of N&#8208;arylglycines to generate, upon decarboxylation, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals. These radicals are then intercepted stereoselectively by &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates, whose formation is mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. Cyclisation leads to catalyst turnover and formation of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones. The utility of the protocol was demonstrated with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.

         <title>Dynamic Interconversions of Single Molecules Probed by Recognition Tunneling at Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Functionalized Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic conversions of single molecules can be monitored at doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized supramolecular junctions. Through this intermolecular recognition tunneling technique, the molecular conductance of different analytes and analyte mixtures can be finger&#8208;printed in dependence on pH and competitive salts, showcasing the first examples of direct as well as displacement titrations of single host&#8211;guest complexes at electronic junctions.







Abstract
We introduce a versatile recognition tunneling technique using doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized electrodes to form supramolecular junctions that capture analytes dynamically by host&#8211;guest complexation. This results in characteristic changes in their single&#8208;molecule conductance. For structurally related drug molecules (camptothecin, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and berberine) and mixtures thereof, we observed distinct current switching signals related to their intrinsic conductance properties as well as pH&#8208;dependent effects which can be traced back to their different states (protonated versus neutral). The conductance variation of a single molecule with pH shows a sigmoidal distribution, allowing us to extract a pKa value for reversible protonation, which is consistent with the reported macroscopic results. The new electronic method allows the characterization of unmodified drug molecules and showcases the transfer of dynamic supramolecular chemistry principles to single molecules.

         <title>Strong Proton&#8208;Electron Coupling in &#960;&#8208;Planar Metal Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong proton&#8208;electron coupling behavior of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel(II) complex with redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands was demonstrated using optical and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculations. The potential&#8208;pH diagram shows a significant shift in the acidity&#8208;dependent redox potential, which is supported by the calculated energetic stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8208;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8208;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.

&lt;p&gt;The strong proton-electron coupling behavior of a &#960;-planar nickel(II) complex with redox-active N,S-ligands was demonstrated using optical and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculations. The potential-pH diagram shows a significant shift in the acidity-dependent redox potential, which is supported by the calculated energetic stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox-active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;-planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono-electronics. Here, proton-electron coupling of a &#960;-planar nickel complex bearing redox-active N,S-ligands, Ni(itsq)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton-electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET-type &#960;-planar metal complex with redox-inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than that in [Ni(dcpdt)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These results indicate that &#960;-planar metal complexes with redox-active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET-type materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;: Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) was made photoswitchable following an &#8220;azo&#8208;extension&#8221; approach on the indole moiety. A library of azo&#8208;DMTs was synthesized out of which 5&#8208;(4&#8208;MeO)&#8208;azo&#8208;DMT (Photo&#8208;DMT) acted as cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221;.







Abstract
Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT2A receptor (5&#8208;HT2AR) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated by visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound 2&#8201;h (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its cis isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the trans isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a cis&#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT2AR signaling.

Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol was synthesized in 14 steps from a readily available compound. The synthesis features efficient sequential [2+2] cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to assemble the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol has been achieved in 14 steps. An efficient AgSbF6/t&#8208;BuCl&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the alkynone&#8208;tethered enamine was developed to prepare the highly strained cyclobutene. It was used in combination with a subsequent retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to efficiently construct the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.

         <title>Stereoinvertive Nucleophilic Substitution at Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters of Cyclopropyl Ketones and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis&#8208;acid catalyzed stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl ketones and cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives is reported. A variety of tertiary alkyl bromides, chlorides and azides are prepared in good yields with excellent stereopurity via a postulated bicyclobutonium intermediate.







Abstract
A highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl ketones and cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using TMSBr, DMPSCl and TMSN3 as nucleophiles has been developed. A variety of acyclic tertiary alkyl bromides, chlorides and azides were therefore prepared with excellent diastereopurity. The substitution occurs at the most substituted quaternary carbon center in a stereoinvertive manner, which may be attributed to the existence of a bicyclobutonium species.

         <title>A Simple Fluorescence Affinity Assay to Decipher Uranyl&#8208;Binding to Native Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent uranyl probe was designed and validated for the reliable determination of uranyl&#8211;protein affinities, at equilibrium and in biologically relevant conditions.







Abstract
Determining the affinity of proteins for uranyl is key to understand the toxicity of this cation and to further develop decorporation strategies. However, usual techniques to achieve that goal often require specific equipment and expertise. Here, we propose a simple, efficient, fluorescence&#8208;based method to assess the affinity of proteins and peptides for uranyl, at equilibrium and in buffered solution. We first designed and characterized an original uranyl&#8208;binding fluorescent probe. We then built a reference scale for uranyl affinity in solution, relying on signal quenching of our fluorescent probe in presence of high&#8208;affinity uranyl&#8208;binding peptides. We finally validated our approach by re&#8208;evaluating the uranyl&#8208;binding affinity of four native proteins. We envision that this tool will facilitate the reliable and reproducible assessment of affinities of peptides and proteins for uranyl.

         <title>Ligand Fluorination to Mitigate the Raman Relaxation of DyIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets: A Combined Terahertz, Far&#8208;IR and Vibronic Barrier Model Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination at the axial position of pentagonal&#8208;bipyraimdal dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnets is shown to effectively reduce the anharmonic phonon&#8208;assisted Raman relaxation process, as validated by THz, far&#8208;IR, ab initio, and DFT calculations using a newly established vibronic&#8208;barrier model.







Abstract
The fast Raman relaxation process via a virtual energy level has become a puzzle for how to chemically engineer single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with better performance. Here, we use the trifluoromethyl group to systematically substitute the methyl groups in the axial position of the parent bis&#8208;butoxide pentapyridyl dysprosium(III) SMM. The resulting complexes&#8212;[Dy(OLA)2py5][BPh4] (LA=CH(CF3)2&#8722; 1, CH2CF3&#8722; 2, CMe2CF3&#8722; 3)&#8212;show progressively enhanced TBhys (@100&#8197;Oe&#8201;s&#8722;1) from 17&#8197;K (for 3), 20&#8197;K (for 2) to 23&#8197;K (for 1). By experimentally identifying the varied under barrier relaxation energy in the 5&#8211;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 regime, we are able to identify that the C&#8722;F bond related vibration energy of the axial ligand ranging from 200 to 350&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is the key variant for this improvement. Thus, this finding not only reveals a correlation between the structure and the Raman process but also provides a paradigm for how to apply the vibronic barrier model to analyze multi&#8208;phonon relaxation processes in lanthanide SMMs.

     alt="Ligand Fluorination to Mitigate the Raman Relaxation of DyIII Single-Molecule Magnets: A Combined Terahertz, Far-IR and Vibronic Barrier Model Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorination at the axial position of pentagonal-bipyraimdal dysprosium(III) single-molecule magnets is shown to effectively reduce the anharmonic phonon-assisted Raman relaxation process, as validated by THz, far-IR, ab initio, and DFT calculations using a newly established vibronic-barrier model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fast Raman relaxation process via a virtual energy level has become a puzzle for how to chemically engineer single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with better performance. Here, we use the trifluoromethyl group to systematically substitute the methyl groups in the axial position of the parent bis-butoxide pentapyridyl dysprosium(III) SMM. The resulting complexes&#8212;[Dy(OL&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;py&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;][BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;=CH(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;)&#8212;show progressively enhanced T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;hys&lt;/sup&gt; (@100&#8197;Oe&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) from 17&#8197;K (for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 20&#8197;K (for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) to 23&#8197;K (for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). By experimentally identifying the varied under barrier relaxation energy in the 5&#8211;500&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; regime, we are able to identify that the C&#8722;F bond related vibration energy of the axial ligand ranging from 200 to 350&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the key variant for this improvement. Thus, this finding not only reveals a correlation between the structure and the Raman process but also provides a paradigm for how to apply the vibronic barrier model to analyze multi-phonon relaxation processes in lanthanide SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction and SEM&#8208;EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.







Abstract
Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.

         <title>Engineering eg Orbital Occupancy of Pt with Au Alloying Enables Reversible Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the eg occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) is reported to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Lowering eg occupancy of Pt in PtAu can elevate the antibonding orbitals and enhance the adsorption strength towards LiO2, resulting in high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Constructing well&#8208;designed catalysts to accelerate OER catalytic activity and alleviate the charge overpotential is prevailing for achieving sophisticated Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Herein, we report a concept for engineering the eg occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy results coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the highly electronegative Au can capture more eg electrons from Pt, leading to less eg electrons of Pt in PtAu than that in PtRu. The lower eg occupancy of Pt atoms in PtAu alloys entails the upward shift of the Pt d band, which causes a strong binding strength towards the intermediates (LiO2), thereby decreasing the OER energy barrier. As a consequence, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a PtAu cathode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.36&#8197;V and superior cycle life of 220&#8197;cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is among the best in the reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Chiral Arene Ligand as Stereocontroller for Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation
</title>

         <dc:description>
A class of facilely tunable, [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived chiral arene ligands has been developed, by which a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;methoxybenzamides with alkynes was achieved, affording a series of axially chiral isoquinolones in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to 96&#8201;% ee. This work opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8722;H activation by using a chiral arene ligand as stereocontroller.







Abstract
Development of chiral ligands is the most fundamental task in metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis. In the last 60&#8197;years, various kinds of ligands have been sophisticatedly developed. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to develop practically useful chiral &#951;6&#8208;arene ligands, thereby seriously hampering the asymmetric synthesis promoted by arene&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a class of readily tunable, C2&#8208;symmetric chiral arene ligands derived from [2.2]paracyclophane. Its ruthenium(II) complexes have been prepared and successfully applied in the enantioselective C&#8722;H activation to afford a series of axially chiral isoquinolones (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 96&#8201;% ee). This study not only lays chemists&#8217; longstanding doubts about whether it is possible to use chiral arene ligands to stereocontrol ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation, but also opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Soft Electrodes for Electrochemical and Electrophysiological Monitoring of Beating Cardiomyocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft electrode with a PEDOT&#8208;based nanomesh with excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility is reported. It allowed the real&#8208;time monitoring of both biomolecule release and electrophysiological activity of beating cardiomyocytes. This work provides a versatile platform for the simultaneous characterization of the chemical and electrical responses from dynamically pulsing cells.







Abstract
Many cells in vivo have their inherent motions, which involve numerous biochemical and biophysical signals synergistically regulating cell behavior and function. However, existing methods offer little information about the concurrently chemical and physical responses of dynamically pulsing cells. Here, we report a soft electrode with an electrospun poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)&#8208;based nanomesh to fully comply with spontaneous motions of cells. Moreover, this electrode demonstrated excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility. Cardiomyocytes cultured thereon exhibited autonomous and rhythmic contractility, and synchronously induced mechanical deformation of the underlying electrode, which allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of nitric oxide release and electrophysiological activity of cardiomyocytes. This work provides a promising way toward recording chemical and electrical signals of biological systems with their natural motions.

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine&#8208;Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual fluorine&#8208;rich oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2, which exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4), both being the largest values for transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;centered oxyfluorides, has been successfully constructed by a fluorine&#8208;enrichment strategy for simultaneously enhancing band gap and SHG response.







Abstract
The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements: the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (a wide band gap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide band gap (5.88&#8197;eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4)&#8212;both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides&#8212;as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged band gap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.

         <title>Trapping X&#8208;ray Radiation Damage from Homolytic Se&#8722;C Bond Cleavage in BnSeSeBn Crystals (Bn=benzyl, CH2C6H5)</title>

         <dc:description>
Irradiation of dibenzyl diselenide BnSeSeBn with X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;light homolytically cleaves the Se&#8722;C and Se&#8722;Se bonds inducing stable and metastable radical states. Structural changes due to X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Se&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage could be pin&#8208;pointed in various high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments.







Abstract
Irradiation of dibenzyl diselenide BnSeSeBn with X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;light cleaves the Se&#8722;C and the Se&#8722;Se bonds, inducing stable and metastable radical states. They are inevitably important to all natural and life sciences. Structural changes due to X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Se&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage could be pin&#8208;pointed in various high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments for the first time. Extended DFT methods were applied to characterize the solid&#8208;state structure and support the refinement of the observed residuals as contributions from the BnSeSe&#8901; radical species. The X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;irradiated crystalline samples of BnSeSeBn were characterized by solid&#8208;state EPR. This paper provides insight that in the course of X&#8208;ray structure analysis of selenium compounds not only organo&#8208;selenide radicals like RSe&#8901; may occur, but also organo diselenide BnSeSe&#8901; radicals and organic radicals R&#8901; are generated, particularly important to know in structural biology.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Formamides by Integrating CO2 Capture and Morpholine Formylation on Supported Iridium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morpholine is used as CO2 capture and formylation reagent to get value&#8208;added N&#8208;formylmorpholine under relatively mild reaction conditions. Morpholine can capture CO2 in air efficiently and be further hydrogenated to formamides on isolated Ir/ND@G catalysts with a TON up to 817&#8201;000.







Abstract
Herein we report an efficient and recyclable catalytic system for tandem CO2 capture and N&#8208;formylation to value&#8208;added chemicals. CO2 is apt to be captured by morpholine solution, while a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst, isolated iridium atoms supported over nanadiamond/graphene, is discovered to be highly reactive for the formylation of morpholine, leading to the formation of N&#8208;formylmorpholine with excellent productivity (with a turnover number of 5&#8201;120&#8201;000 in a single batch reaction) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%). In addition, the CO2 captured by morpholine under atmospheric conditions can be converted to N&#8208;formylmorpholine with decent conversion (51&#8201;%), which realizes the integration of CO2 capture and conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiroketals and Spiroaminals via Gold and Iridium Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric cascade reaction of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols/2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines with alkynyl alcohols/amides was realized by using a novel Au/Ir sequential catalytic system, which enables the facile synthesis of structurally diverse spiroketals and spiroaminals with up to high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The enantioselective cascade reaction between racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols and alkynols/alkynamides was realized by using a gold and iridium sequential catalytic system. In this procedure, the in situ generated exocyclic vinyl ethers or enamides undergo the asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization with &#960;&#8208;ally&#8208;Ir amphiphilic species, which provides an efficient and straightforward access to spiroketals and spiroaminals with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also suitable in this reaction along with a kinetic resolution process, affording enantioenriched spiroaminals and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines in good yields. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated by efficient enantioselective synthesis of the analogue of Paecilospirone.

Herein, we report the development of a method for highly regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes generated from 1&#8208;silylcyclopropenes in the presence of a chiral copper(I)/bisoxazoline catalyst for the construction of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylboranes, which cannot be prepared by any other known methods. This reaction is the first highly enantioselective carbene insertion reaction of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes ever to be reported. The method shows general applicability for various 3,3&#8208;disubstituted silylcyclopropenes and exclusively affords E&#8208;products. The novel chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylborane products are versatile allylic bimetallic reagents with high stability and have great synthetic potential, especially for the construction of complex molecules with continuous chiral centers.

         <title>Stereodefined Skipped Dienes through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of allylic C&#8722;H bond to alkyne is reported. A tertiary C&#8722;H bond was cleaved at the site of which a quaternary carbon center was formed. This atom&#8208;economical process provided a straightforward synthetic route to skipped dienes containing a C3&#8208;quaternary carbon. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters through enantio&#8208;convergent vinylation of tertiary C&#8722;H bond was also feasible.







Abstract
Preparation of skipped dienes with a quaternary carbon center at the C&#8208;3 position remains a synthetic challenge. We report here an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of tertiary sp3 C&#8722;H bond to alkyne for the facile preparation of skipped dienes. The tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved regioselectively, at the site of which a new C&#8722;C bond is formed. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters is also demonstrated.

         <title>Persistent Ambipolar Heptacenes and Their Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble heptacenes are stabilized via TIPS&#8208;ethynylation and halogenation. TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every second ring is critical for longevity. The most stable derivative is characterized in thin&#8208;film transistors and post&#8208;functionalized via Stille coupling to a nonarene.







Abstract
Sixfold TIPS&#8208;ethynylation combined with fourfold bromination of the armchair edges furnishes a long&#8208;lived, soluble heptacene; &#960;&#8208;extension via Stille coupling accesses a persistent tetrabenzononacene. Both types of acenes were stabilized best by double TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every other benzene ring. Tetrabromoheptacene is an ambipolar transistor material (up to 0.036&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 n&#8208;channel), which was corroborated by generation of its monoanion and monocation.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkylation of alkenes with indoles, thiophenes and electron rich arenes has been developed. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles via hydrogen atom transfer.







Abstract
An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts type alkylation.

         <title>Catalytic Desymmetric Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 26, June 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes by a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed to access pyrrolidinones bearing multi&#8208;stereocenters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The utilization of the 8&#8208;Quinox ligand is crucial for maintaining high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The construction of multi&#8208;stereocenters by a transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is a major challenge. The catalytic desymmetric functionalization of unactivated alkenes remains largely unexplored. Herein, we disclose &#8208;a desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of 1,6&#8208;dienes via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The leverage of the underdeveloped chiral 8&#8208;Quinox enables the Ni&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric carbamoylalkylation of both unactivated mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes to form pyrrolidinone bearing two nonadjacent stereogenic centers in high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivitives with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The synthetic application of pyrrolidinones allows the rapid access to complex chiral fused&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>&#173; A Field&#8208;Independent Method for the Rapid Generation of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Clean Water Solutions for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization methods in magnetic resonance enhance the signals by several orders of magnitude, opening new windows for real&#8208;time investigations of dynamic processes  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Here, we propose a field&#8208;independent para&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;based pulsed method to produce rapidly hyperpolarized  13  C&#8208;labeled substrates. We demonstrate the method by polarizing the carboxylic carbon of the pyruvate moiety in a purposely designed precursor to 24% at ~22 mT. Following a fast purification procedure, we measure 8% polarization on free  [  1&#8208;  13  C]pyruvate in clean water solutions at physiological conditions at 7 T. The enhanced signals allow real&#8208;time monitoring of the pyruvate&#8208;lactate conversion in cancer cells, demonstrating the potential of the method for biomedical applications in combination with existing or developing magnetic resonance technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Formation of Covalent Basket Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living systems use chemical fuels to transiently assemble functional structures. As a step toward constructing abiotic mimics of such structures, we herein describe fuel&#8208;driven formation of covalent basket cage CBC&#160;  5  &#160;by&#160;reversible imine condensation&#160;of cup&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#160;  2  &#160; (i.e., basket) with&#160;trivalent aromatic amine &#160;  4  . This nanosized [4+4] cage (  V  &#160;= 5 nm  3  ,&#160;  M  w  &#160;= 6150 Da) has shape of a truncated tetrahedron with four baskets at&#160;its vertices&#160;and four aromatic amines forming&#160;the faces. Importantly,&#160;  tris  &#8208;aldehyde basket&#160;  2  &#160;and aliphatic&#160;  tris  &#8208;amine&#160;  7&#160;  undergo condensation to  &#160;  give small [1+1] cage&#160;  6  . The imine metathesis of such&#160;  6  &#160;and aromatic&#160;  tris  &#8208;amine&#160;  4  &#160;into CBC&#160;  5&#160;  was optimized&#160;to bias the equilibrium&#160;favouring&#160;  6  . Addition of tribromoacetic acid (TBA) as a chemical fuel perturbs this equilibrium to result in the transient formation of CBC&#160;  5  ,  &#160;  with subsequent consumption of TBA via decarboxylation driving the system back to the starting state.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Coordination Assembly of Dynamic Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination states of metal&#8211;organic materials are known to dictate their physicochemical properties and applications in various fields. However, understanding and controlling coordination sites in metal&#8211;organic systems is challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of site&#8208;selective coordinated metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) using flavonoids as coordination modulators. The site&#8208;selective coordination was systematically investigated experimentally and computationally using ligands with one, two, and multiple different coordination sites. Tuning the multimodal Fe coordination with catechol, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups within the MPNs enabled the facile engineering of diverse physicochemical properties including size (15% size shrinkage), selective permeability (20&#8211;2000 kDa), and pH&#8208;dependent degradability. This study expands our understanding of metal&#8211;phenolic chemistry and provides new routes for the rational design of structurally tailorable coordination&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconvoluting the Optical Response of Biocompatible Photonic Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To unlock the widespread use of block copolymers as photonic pigments, there is an urgent need to consider their environmental impact (cf microplastic pollution). Here we show how an inverse photonic glass architecture can enable the use of biocompatible bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs), which otherwise lack the refractive index contrast needed for a strong photonic response. A library of photonic pigments is produced from poly(norbornene&#8208;graft&#8208;polycaprolactone)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(norbornene&#8208;graft&#8208;polyethylene glycol), with the color tuned via either the BBCP molecular weight or the processing temperature upon microparticle fabrication. The structure&#8209;optic relationship between the 3D porous morphology of the microparticles and their complex optical response is revealed by both an analytical scattering model and 3D finite&#8208;difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. Combined, this allows for strategies to enhance the color purity to be proposed and realized with our biocompatible BBCP system.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a site distance effect, which emphasizes how well the distance of the adjacent copper atoms (denoted as dCu1&#8208;Cu1) matches&#160;with the reactant peroxydisulfate&#160;(PDS)&#160;molecular size determines the Fenton&#8208;like reaction reactivity&#160;on the carbon&#8208;supported SACs.&#160;The optimized dCu1&#8208;Cu1&#160;in the range of 5&#8211;6 &#197; that matches the molecular size of PDS endows a nearly two times higher turnover frequency than that of dCu1&#8208;Cu1&#160;beyond this range, accordingly achieving&#160;the record&#8208;breaking kinetics for emerging organic contaminant oxidation. Further studies suggest that this site distance effect originates&#160;from the alteration of PDS adsorption to a dual&#8208;site structure on Cu1&#8208;Cu1&#160;sites when dCu1&#8208;Cu1&#160;falls in 5&#8211;6 &#197;, significantly enhancing&#160;the interfacial charge transfer and consequently resulting&#160;in the most efficient catalyst for PDS activation so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Azo Compounds as Active Materials of Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid evolution of electrical devices and the increasing demand for the supply of sustainable energy necessitate the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems such as rechargeable and redox flow batteries. However, these batteries typically contain inorganic active materials, which exhibit several critical drawbacks hindering further development. In this regard, azo compounds are promising alternatives, offering the benefits of fast kinetics, multi&#8208;electron redox reactions, and tunable (via structural adjustment) battery performance. Herein, we review the use of azo compounds as the active materials of rechargeable and redox flow batteries, discuss certain aspects of material design and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, and summarize the corresponding perspectives and research directions to facilitate further progress in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Polyester Bottlebrush Amphiphiles toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Photonic Pigments via Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biodegradable photonic microspheres with structural colors are promising substitutes to polluting microbeads and toxic dyes. Here, amphiphilic polyester&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) with polylactic acid or poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) as the hydrophobic block are &#160;synthesized and used to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly photonic pigments. Molecular parameters of BBCPs, including rigidity and symmetry, are precisely tailored by&#160;variation of side chain lengths, which enables effective manipulation of interfacial tension (&#947;). Organized spontaneous emulsion mechanism is enabled only when &#947; falls in a suitable range (10.6~14.3 mN/m), producing ordered water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water multiple emulsions and ordered porous structures. Consequently, highly saturated and tunable structural colors are observed due to coherent light scattering from the porous structures. Such photonic materials are nontoxic as confirmed by careful safety tests using aquatic model organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Programmable AgAuS&#8208;Primed Conductive Nanowelding Wires up Wet Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials, directed by molecular or supramolecular interactions, is a powerful strategy to build nanoscale devices. Despite many advantages of such solution&#8208;based processes, a big challenge is to realize interparticle ohmic contacts toward facilitated charge transport over a long distance. Herein we report a new concept of primed nanowelding to thread solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles in prescribed assemblies. The process starts with a gap&#8208;specific deposition of Ag  2  E (E = S, Se) materials in pre&#8208;assembled gold structures, which immediately and spontaneously transform into AgAuE semiconductors via directional gold diffusion. Further treatment with tributylphosphine generates alloyed Au/Ag welding spots that conductively wire up nanoparticles into discrete &#8220;molecules&#8221; and micron&#8208;long &#8220;polymers&#8221;. This work delivers a possible solution compatible with DNA programming to the carrier&#8208;transport dilemma in solution&#8208;processed nanostructures toward better&#8208;functioning nanodevices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanopore&#8208;Based Saccharide Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saccharides play critical roles in many forms of cellular activities. Saccharide structures are however complicated and similar, setting a technical hurdle for direct identification. Nanopores, which are emerging single molecule tools sensitive to minor structural differences between analytes, can be engineered to identity saccharides. A hetero&#8208;octameric  Mycobacterium smegmatis  porin A nanopore containing a phenylboronic acid was prepared, and was able to clearly identify nine monosaccharide types, including D&#8208;Fructose, D&#8208;Galactose, D&#8208;Mannose, D&#8208;Glucose, L&#8208;Sorbose, D&#8208;Ribose, D&#8208;Xylose, L&#8208;Rhamnose and N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosamine. Minor structural differences between saccharide epimers can also be distinguished. To assist automatic event classification, a machine learning algorithm was developed, with which a general accuracy score of 0.96 was achieved. This sensing strategy is generally suitable for other saccharide types and may bring new insights to nanopore saccharide sequencing.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the addition of C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to carbonyls and related structures are well established the related addition to thiocarbonyls compounds are unknown. Herein, we report a reaction cascade in which a C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate undergo addition to dithioester, trithiocarbonates and xanthates. The reaction provides access to a range of dihydrothiophenes and dihydrothiopyrans (28&#8208;examples). Mechanistic investigations, including isolation of intermediates, electronic correlation, and kinetic isotope effect studies support the viability of an activated acid intermediate giving rise to the C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate which undergoes turnover limiting cyclization. Subsequent formation of a &#946;&#8722;thiolactone regenerates the catalyst with loss of carbon oxysulfide providing the observed products.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Strain on the Rotation of an Artificial Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In artificial small&#8208;molecule machines, molecular motors can be used to perform work on coupled systems by applying a mechanical load &#8211; such as strain &#8211; that allows for energy transduction. Here, we report how ring strain influences the rotation of a rotary molecular motor. Bridging the two halves of the motor with alkyl tethers of varying sizes yields macrocycles that constrain the motor&#8217;s movement. Increasing the ring size by two methylene increments increases the mobility of the motor stepwise and allows for fine&#8208;tuning of strain in the system. Small macrocycles (8&#8211;14 methylene units) only undergo a photochemical  E/Z  isomerization. Larger macrocycles (16&#8211;22 methylene units) can perform a full rotational cycle, but thermal helix inversion is strongly dependent on the ring size. This study provides systematic and quantitative insight into the behavior of molecular motors under a mechanical load, paving the way for the development of complex coupled nanomachinery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The complexation of MgII with adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) is omnipresent in biochemical energy conversion, but is difficult to interrogate directly. Here we used the spin&#8208;&#189; &#946;&#8208;emitter 31Mg to study MgII&#8208;ATP complexation in 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM&#8208;Ac) solutions using &#946;&#8208;radiation&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance (&#946;&#8208;NMR). We demonstrate that (nuclear) spin&#8208;polarized 31Mg, following ion&#8208;implantation from an accelerator beamline into EMIM&#8208;Ac, binds to ATP within its radioactive lifetime before depolarizing. The evolution of the spectra with solute concentration indicates that the implanted 31Mg initially bind to the solvent acetate anions, whereafter they undergo dynamic exchange and form either a mono&#8208; (31Mg&#8208;ATP) or di&#8208;nuclear (31MgMg&#8208;ATP) complex. The chemical shift of 31Mg&#8208;ATP is observed up&#8208;field of 31MgMg&#8208;ATP, in accord with quantum chemical calculations. These observations constitute a crucial advance towards using &#946;&#8208;NMR to probe biologically relevant contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping&#8208;Mediated Energy&#8208;Level Engineering of M@Au12 Superatoms (M=Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) for Efficient Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of diphosphine&#8208;protected M@Au12 superatoms (M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) were synthesized and characterized. The photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activity of the M@Au12 superatoms were enhanced by doping with Pt, Rh, or Ir.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of MAu12(dppe)5Cl2 (MAu12; M=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir; dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), which have icosahedral M@Au12 superatomic cores, and systematically investigated their electronic structures, photoluminescence (PL) and photocatalytic properties. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was expanded when doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table. The PL quantum yield was enhanced with an increase in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and reached 0.46&#8211;0.67 for MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) under deaerated conditions. The bright PLs from MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) were assigned to phosphorescence based on quenching by O2. MAu12 (M=Pt, Rh, or Ir) acted as a more efficient and stable photocatalyst than Au13 for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone via the oxidative quenching cycle. This study provides rational guides for designing photoluminescent and photocatalytic gold superatoms by the doping of heterometal elements.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydroisoquinolines: Seven&#8208;Step Asymmetric Synthesis of Michellamines&#8197;B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and step&#8208;economical approach based on a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade has been established for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinolines. This synthetic strategy enabled concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen as well as four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) is a common heterocyclic structural unit of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. The assembly of this structural unit is not trivial, which constitutes a substantial challenge in the total synthesis of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids and related pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report a modular and convergent method for the rapid assembly of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQ frameworks through a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade. With widely available simple aryl iodides, aziridines and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene as the building blocks, this method paves a practical way for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQs. Based on this new method, concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen and four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been accomplished, demonstrating the broad synthetic utility of this approach.

         <title>The Chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable Cu3N and Cu3PdN were obtained. The precursor conversion mechanism is elucidated; oleylamine is oxidized to a primary aldimine and the latter reacts further with oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N.







Abstract
The precursor conversion chemistry and surface chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN nanocrystals are unknown or contested. Here, we first obtain phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable nanocubes. Second, we elucidate the pathway by which copper(II) nitrate and oleylamine form Cu3N. We find that oleylamine is both a reductant and a nitrogen source. Oleylamine is oxidized by nitrate to a primary aldimine, which reacts further with excess oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N. Third, we investigated the surface chemistry and find a mixed ligand shell of aliphatic amines and carboxylates (formed in situ). While the carboxylates appear tightly bound, the amines are easily desorbed from the surface. Finally, we show that doping with palladium decreases the band gap and the material becomes semi&#8208;metallic. These results bring insight into the chemistry of metal nitrides and might help the development of other metal nitride nanocrystals.

         <title>Spatially Controlled CO2 Conversion Kinetics in Natural Leaves for Motion Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural CO2 conversion is triggered with high spatial control by shining light on precision&#8208;tailored pristine leaves. The site&#8208;selective evolution of oxygen under irradiation is used to generate motion of all&#8208;natural macro&#8208; and microswimmers.







Abstract
Living systems that can spontaneously exhibit directional motion belong to diverse classes such as bacteria, sperm and plankton. They have fascinated scientists in recent years to design completely artificial or biohybrid mobile objects. Natural ingredients, like parts of plants, have been used to elaborate miniaturized dynamic objects, which can move when they are combined with other, non&#8208;natural, building blocks. Herein, we report that the precise structural tailoring of natural plant leaves allows generating a spatially predefined and confined release of oxygen gas, due to the conversion of carbon dioxide. This constitutes the driving force for generating motion, which is solely due to the respiration of leaves by photosynthesis. The rate of gas evolution can be fine&#8208;tuned by changing the light intensity and the leaf size, allowing ultimately to control the motility of objects with dimensions ranging from the millimeter to the micrometer scale.

&lt;p&gt;Natural CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion is triggered with high spatial control by shining light on precision-tailored pristine leaves. The site-selective evolution of oxygen under irradiation is used to generate motion of all-natural macro- and microswimmers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living systems that can spontaneously exhibit directional motion belong to diverse classes such as bacteria, sperm and plankton. They have fascinated scientists in recent years to design completely artificial or biohybrid mobile objects. Natural ingredients, like parts of plants, have been used to elaborate miniaturized dynamic objects, which can move when they are combined with other, non-natural, building blocks. Herein, we report that the precise structural tailoring of natural plant leaves allows generating a spatially predefined and confined release of oxygen gas, due to the conversion of carbon dioxide. This constitutes the driving force for generating motion, which is solely due to the respiration of leaves by photosynthesis. The rate of gas evolution can be fine-tuned by changing the light intensity and the leaf size, allowing ultimately to control the motility of objects with dimensions ranging from the millimeter to the micrometer scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepping Out of the Blue: From Visible to Near&#8208;IR Triggered Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are in high demand and have sparked great research interest in the past decade. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We evaluate the pros and cons of each type based on their photochromic properties and conclude with a perspective on how the field may develop in the future.







Abstract
Light offers unique opportunities for controlling the activity of materials and biosystems with high spatiotemporal resolution. Molecular photoswitches are chromophores that undergo reversible isomerization between different states upon irradiation with light, allowing a convenient means to control their influence over the system of interest. However, a significant limitation of classical photoswitches is the requirement to initiate the switching in one or both directions using deleterious UV light with poor tissue penetration. Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are hence in high demand and have attracted keen recent research interest. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We hope to inspire further endeavors in this field, allowing the full potential of these tools in biotechnology and materials chemistry applications to be realized.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction through Hydrophobic Microenvironment and Binuclear Cobalt Synergistic Effect in Metallogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallogels based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipids with cobalt ions can be used as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction presenting high efficiency and good product selectivity. Mimicking the natural lipid bilayer not only provides these soft matter catalysts with a hydrophobic microenvironment and binuclear synergistic effect but also renders them environmentally friendly with recycling and degradable properties.







Abstract
Assemblies that mimic natural lipid bilayers are theoretically efficient for photocatalytic CO2 reduction; however, such an approach has not been yet explored. Herein, metallogels (LG/Nico&#8208;Co) based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipid (LG/Nico) and cobalt ions exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with 208&#8201;724&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 24&#8197;h and 90&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, or 166&#8201;826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 12&#8197;h and 46&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, depending on the water content of the solvent. The alkyl chains of LG/Nico provide a hydrophobic microenvironment for efficient gas transfer, and the assembled bilayers induce a synergistic effect between two adjacent Co ions for catalyzing the CO2 reduction reaction. These architectures present new alternatives for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic soft matter based on the assembly of small amphiphilic molecules.

         <title>Asymmetrically Doping a Platinum Atom into a Au38 Nanocluster for Changing the Electron Configuration and Reactivity in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters are prepared by doping one and two Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24.This study provides an opportunity for systematically investigating the electron configuration change of the nanoclusters in the consecutive doping process and shows the order of electrocatalytic activity: Pt1Au37 &gt; Au38 &gt; Pt2Au36.







Abstract
It is an obstacle to precisely manipulate a doped heteroatom into a desired position in a metal nanocluster. Herein, we overcome this difficulty to obtain Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters via controllably doping Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24. We reveal that asymmetrical doping of one Pt atom into either of the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 elevates the relative energy of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) accompanied by one valence electron loss of Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24, compared to Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 with 14 electrons, while symmetrical doping of two Pt atoms into the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 narrows the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 with two valence electrons less. Consequently, Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 shows an electron&#8208;spin&#8208;induced high activity for CO2 electroreduction, whereas Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 is least efficient and Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 has a decent performance.

         <title>An Ultrastable 155&#8208;Nuclei Silver Nanocluster Protected by Thiacalix[4]arene and Cyclohexanethiol for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual C5h&#8208;symmetric silver nanocluster (Ag155) with the highest reported nuclearity was prepared by exploiting the protection of the macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A) and cyclohexanethiol (CySH). This silver nanocluster exhibits excellent stability in solution and photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Thiacalix[4]arenes have emerged as a family of macrocyclic ligands to protect metal nanoparticles, but it remains a great challenge to solve the mystery of their structures at the atomic level, especially for those larger than 2&#8197;nm. Here, we report the largest known mixed&#8208;valence silver nanocluster [Ag155(CyS)40(TC4A)5Cl2] (Ag155) protected by deprotonated cyclohexanethiol (CySH) and macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A). Its single&#8208;crystal structure consists of a metallic core of four concentric shells, Ag13@Ag42@Ag30@Ag70, lined with a organic skin of 40CyS&#8722; and 5TC4A4&#8722; and 2Cl&#8722;. Ag155 manifests an unusual pseudo&#8208;5&#8208;fold symmetry dictated by the intrinsic metal atom packing and the regioselective distribution of mixed protective ligands. This work not only reveals a macrocyclic ligand effect on the formation of a large silver nanocluster, but also provides a new structural archetype for comprehensively perceiving their interface and metal kernel structures.

&lt;p&gt;Thiacalix[4]arenes have emerged as a family of macrocyclic ligands to protect metal nanoparticles, but it remains a great challenge to solve the mystery of their structures at the atomic level, especially for those larger than 2&#8197;nm. Here, we report the largest known mixed-valence silver nanocluster [Ag&lt;sub&gt;155&lt;/sub&gt;(CyS)&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;(TC4A)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Ag155&lt;/b&gt;) protected by deprotonated cyclohexanethiol (CySH) and macrocyclic ligand &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylthiacalix[4]arene (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TC4A). Its single-crystal structure consists of a metallic core of four concentric shells, Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;@Ag&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;@Ag&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;@Ag&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, lined with a organic skin of 40CyS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and 5TC4A&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and 2Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Ag155&lt;/b&gt; manifests an unusual pseudo-5-fold symmetry dictated by the intrinsic metal atom packing and the regioselective distribution of mixed protective ligands. This work not only reveals a macrocyclic ligand effect on the formation of a large silver nanocluster, but also provides a new structural archetype for comprehensively perceiving their interface and metal kernel structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous Polyimide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Multiple Redox&#8208;Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Cathodic Li Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with high loading density of redox&#8208;active centers and a mesoporous channel for facile Li+&#8208;ion diffusion has been designed and fabricated, exhibiting one of the best performances among the thus far reported COF&#8208;based cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are gaining increasing attention as renewable cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, COF electrodes reported so far still exhibit unsatisfying capacity due to their limited active site density and insufficient utilization. Herein, a new two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked COF, HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF with multiple redox&#8208;active sites for storing Li+ ions, was designed and fabricated from a new module of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacarboxyl hexaazatrinaphthalene trianhydrides with a 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone linker. HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF possessing excellent stability, good conductivity, and a large pore size of 3.8&#8197;nm enables the stable and fast ion transport. This, in combination with the abundant redox active sites, results in a high reversible capacity of 319&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=358&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) for the HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF electrode with a high active site utilization of 89&#8201;% and good cycle performance, representing one of the best performances among the reported COF electrodes.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;Rearrangement of Porous Organic Cage Membrane for CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive CO2 capture in a porous organic cage membrane can be assisted by ionic liquid molecules (e.g., BMIMBF4). Ionic liquid molecules electrostatically induce the crystal&#8208;rearrangement of cage molecules to construct regular nanochannels as well as aiding in situ nanochannel regulation.







Abstract
Porous Organic Cages (POCs) with tunable tailoring chemistry properties and polymer&#8208;like processing conditions are of great potential for molecular selective membranes, but it remains challenging in the assembly of high crystalline POCs with regular nanochannels for effective molecular sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;rearrangement strategy for the design of a POC membrane with heterostructure. Due to electrostatic attraction, ionic liquid molecules induced cage molecules to rearrange into a sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm uniform and defect&#8208;free crystal layer, which displayed competitive CO2 separation performance. The optimized hetero&#8208;structured membrane exhibited an attractive CO2/N2 separation selectivity of over 130, which was superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes, accompanied with excellent long&#8208;term and thermal shock stability. This strategy provides a new inspiration for the preparation of crystal&#8208;rearranged membranes with regular channels for gas molecule sieving.

         <title>Unlocking New Reactivities in Enzymes by Iminium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the different strategies used in the design and engineering of novel enzymes that accommodate iminium catalysis. The advantages and challenges of developing enzymes for this catalysis mode are discussed. Recent developments in iminium biocatalysis showcase the tremendous power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to create useful biocatalysts for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature transformations.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysis in conquering challenging synthesis requires the constant input of new enzymes. Developing novel biocatalysts by absorbing catalysis modes from synthetic chemistry has yielded fruitful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes. Organocatalysis was originally bio&#8208;inspired and has become the third pillar of asymmetric catalysis. Transferring organocatalytic reactions back to enzyme platforms is a promising approach for biocatalyst creation. Herein, we summarize recent developments in the design of novel biocatalysts that adopt iminium catalysis, a fundamental branch in organocatalysis. By repurposing existing enzymes or constructing artificial enzymes, various biocatalysts for iminium catalysis have been created and optimized via protein engineering to promote valuable abiological transformations. Recent advances in iminium biocatalysis illustrate the power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to generate useful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes.

         <title>Highly Selective Carbonylation of CH3Cl to Acetic Acid Catalyzed by Pyridine&#8208;Treated MOR Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into acetic acid via CH3Cl carbonylation over H&#8208;zeolites is reported. A 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) selectivity was obtained over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR at 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. This strategy enables efficient conversion of methane into oxygenates under mild conditions.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions is of great significance for the commercially viable and sustainable utilization of methane but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for efficiently converting methane to acetic acid via CH3Cl as an intermediate. Up to 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid and methyl acetate (AA+MA) selectivity was achieved over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR (MOR&#8208;8) under moderate conditions of 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. Water, conventionally detrimental to carbonylation reaction over zeolite catalysts, was conducive to the production of AA in the current reaction system. In the 100&#8197;h continuous test with the MOR&#8208;8 catalyst, the average AA+MA selectivity remained over 98&#8201;%. AA was formed by carbonylation of methoxy groups within 8&#8208;membered rings of MOR followed by hydrolysis. This strategy provided an approach for highly efficient utilization of methane to oxygenates under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Li2S&#8722;Cu Nanocomposite Cathodes Enabled by Kinetically Favored Displacement Interconversion between Cu2S and Li2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured Li2S&#8722;Cu composite is fabricated and it is demonstrated that Cu progressively participates in the redox processes and fundamentally alters the redox couple from anion&#8208;type Li2S/S to cation&#8208;type Cu/Cu2S, which leads to a drastically reduced activation potential (2.35&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), superior rate capability, and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
The high activation barrier, inferior rate performance, and short cycling life severely constrain the practical applications of the high&#8208;capacity Li2S cathode. Herein, we fabricate a Li2S&#8722;Cu nanocomposite with a drastically reduced activation potential, fast rate capability, and extraordinary cycling stability even under a practically relevant areal capacity of 2.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed experimental investigations aided by theoretical calculations indicate that instead of converting to S8 via troublesome soluble lithium polysulfides, Li2S is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable to react with Cu by the displacement reaction, which alters the redox couple from Li2S/S to Cu/Cu2S, leading to the excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the stability of the composite is demonstrated in the full&#8208;cell configuration consisting of commercial graphite anodes. This work provides an innovative and effective approach to realize highly activated and stable Li2S cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;A nanostructured Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8722;Cu composite is fabricated and it is demonstrated that Cu progressively participates in the redox processes and fundamentally alters the redox couple from anion-type Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S to cation-type Cu/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which leads to a drastically reduced activation potential (2.35&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), superior rate capability, and stable long-term cycling performance.
