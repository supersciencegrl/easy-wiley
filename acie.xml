      <title>Nanoscale Hybrid Amorphous/Graphitic Carbon as Key Towards Next&#8208;Generation Carbon&#8208;Based Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
An amorphous/graphitic hybrid material is synthesized by growing nanoscale graphite crystallites in a non&#8208;nano polymer&#8208;derived carbon by catalytic graphitization. An active dehydrogenation catalyst is obtained by creating accessibility to these graphitic domains via selective oxidation. This carbon dehydrogenation catalyst offers a 10&#8208;fold increase in space&#8208;time&#8208;yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol compared to a carbon nanotube benchmark.







Abstract
A new strategy affords &#8220;non&#8208;nano&#8221; carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts that perform similarly to nanocarbons. Polymer&#8208;based carbon precursors that combine a soft&#8208;template approach with ion adsorption and catalytic graphitization are key to this synthesis strategy, thus offering control over macroscopic shape, texture, and crystallinity and resulting in a hybrid amorphous/graphitic carbon after pyrolysis. From this intermediate the active carbon catalyst is prepared by removing the amorphous parts of the hybrid carbon materials via selective oxidation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol was chosen as test reaction, which shows that fine&#8208;tuning the synthesis of the new carbon catalysts allows to obtain a catalytic material with an attractive high selectivity (82&#8201;%) similar to a carbon nanotube reference, while achieving 10&#8197;times higher space&#8211;time yields at 330&#8201;&#176;C. This new class of carbon materials is accessible via a technically scalable, reproducible synthetic pathway and exhibits spherical particles with diameters around 100&#8197;&#956;m, allowing unproblematic handling similar to classic non&#8208;nano catalysts.

      <title>At Long Last: The Me3Si Group as a Masked Alcohol</title>
      <dc:description>
For a long time, the Me3Si group has been ostracized from the family of aryl&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted congeners for the difficulties associated with its further chemoselective manipulation into another synthetically useful functional group. A hypervalent iodine reagent has now been shown to do exactly that by electrophilic demethylation. Coupled with the Tamao&#8211;Fleming oxidation, the Me3Si group becomes a placeholder for a hydroxy group.

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence for promotional effect of acid sites on the diffusion of alkenes through small&#8208;pore zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined pores of narrow pore zeolites can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments and pulse&#8208;response Temporal Analysis of Products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The [Fe  II  (C  6  F  5  Tp)  2  ] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviors: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of  ca  . 65 K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated to a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated to the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly  ca  . 50% of SCO are switched.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In the study on structure&#8208;property relationship for rational material design, hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shells structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs.

Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote the gas releasing owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force.

However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several &#956;m, and the real&#8208;time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method.

      <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
      <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
      <dc:description>The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of&#160;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline ,&#160;with up to &gt; 99% conversion and &gt; 99%  ee  under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.</dc:description>

      <title>Dually&#8208;Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>
      <dc:description>In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non&#8208;radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual&#8208;passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open&#8208;circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39 V and the best efficiency of 23.80% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99%. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 &#176;C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70%. When the device is aged under 30 &#177; 5% RH, over 97% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Atomically dispersed CoN  4  site catalysts are more desirable than FeN  4  site catalysts to enhance catalyst stability and mitigate Fenton reactions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the lack of an understanding of CoN  x  active site formation during the critical thermal activation makes the rational catalyst design impossible. Here, we elucidate the structural evolution of CoN  4  sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co  2+  ion adsorption. Subsequent  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track inactive Co&#8208;OH and Co&#8208;O species' conversion into active CoN  4  sites. The critical transition occurs at ~700&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8208;N bonds in CoN  4  active sites formed at 900 &#176;C. Inspired by the new understanding, we developed a two&#8208;step chemical pre&#8208;doping and adsorption approach to designing a Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN  4  site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated outstanding proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance and durability.</dc:description>

Here, we elucidate the structural evolution of CoN  4  sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co  2+  ion adsorption. Subsequent  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track inactive Co&#8208;OH and Co&#8208;O species' conversion into active CoN  4  sites. The critical transition occurs at ~700&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8208;N bonds in CoN  4  active sites formed at 900 &#176;C. Inspired by the new understanding, we developed a two&#8208;step chemical pre&#8208;doping and adsorption approach to designing a Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN  4  site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated outstanding proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance and durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg  &#8722;1  &#160;energy density and 84% capacity retention after 100 cycles&#160;in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g&#8201;Ah  &#8722;1  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H  2  S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H  2  S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H  2  S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H  2  S.

      <title>Chemical conversion and locking of the imine linkage: enhancing the functionality of covalent organic frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation in COFs.

In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation.

      <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} By Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW  8  O  30  } was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity(IC  50  =0.29&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes(relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  , which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  combined with FMN to form Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  &#8208;2FMN complex through the one&#8208;electron processe of the W atoms. Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3% at 1.77 &#181;M of NADPH and 86.06% at 10.62 &#181;M of 2&#8208;hydroxy terephthalic acid.

      <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
      <dc:description>A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisaccharides) is shown to enter a straightforward 4&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility to several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated suggesting an universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugate, which we call GlycoBODIPY. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift, furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments underline an efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.</dc:description>

      <title>A Molecular Reporter for Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Based on An Aggregation Induced Emission Platform</title>
      <dc:description>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs) a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like to a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network are denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. Being able to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, as opposed to vitrify, is a challenge, since both processes lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Here, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method with a high fluorescence contrast to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP&#8208;surfactants (NPSs) at the water/oil interface using aggregation induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. At densities where the AIEgens can move and rotate the AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the intermolecular separation distance is sufficiently small to arrest rotation and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs.

      <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature&#8217;s oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8208;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Binessite(&#8208;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 &#186;C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA/cm  2  . Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO  2  , and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8208;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO  2  to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricating highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.</dc:description>

By combining iridium with thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates.

By combining iridium with thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable with the thiourea catalyst recycled and reused.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site&#8208;Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Electron&#8208;transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  ) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron&#8208;transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

This original and convergent synthetic approach provides a strong extension of conjugation yielding chromophores that absorb intensively in far&#8208;red or NIR domains (&#955;  max  up to 791 nm) and fluoresce in the NIR as well (&#955;  max  up to 887 nm). Intense ECD properties around 790 nm with a |&#916;&#949;| value up to 60 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  are observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Amorphous Zn&#8208;Carbon Multichannel Fibers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium metal has drawn wide attention as a competitive anode candidate for next&#8208;generation high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, the application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free&#8208;standing nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8208;carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structures endow effectively reduced local current density, and the lithiophilic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon and functional Zn nanoparticles served as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to guide uniform lithium deposition. As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and symmetric cells show long&#8208;term cycling duration over 2000 h. Moreover, full cells based on the developed anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrate superior rate capability and stable cycle life.</dc:description>

      <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging, despite the importance in understanding of their functions in diverse cellular processes. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria and nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxygen stress in live cells. Moreover, the combination of organelle&#8208;specific targeting with the remotely&#8208;controlled photoactivation of the nanosensors allows the precise APE1 imaging in vivo. We envision that this site&#8208;specific sensor technology will become a valuable tool for in situ monitoring subcellular enzymatic activity that is difficult to access using traditional imaging probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8208;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the&#160;properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8208;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  and 6  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  , 30  o  , respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns.

      <title>Iron oxidation in Escherichia coli bacterioferritin ferroxidase centre, a site designed to react rapidly with H2O2 but slowly with O2</title>
      <dc:description>Both O  2  and H  2  O  2  can oxidise iron at the ferroxidase centre (FC) of  Escherichia coli  bacterioferritin (EcBfr) but mechanistic details of the two reactions need clarification. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies have been used to follow the reactions when apo&#8208;EcBfr, pre&#8208;loaded anaerobically with Fe  2+  , was exposed to O  2  or H  2  O  2  . We show that O  2  binds di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC reversibly, two Fe  2+  ions are oxidised in concert and a H  2  O  2  molecule is formed and released to solution. This peroxide molecule further oxidises another di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC, at a rate ~1000 faster than O  2  , ensuring an overall 1:4 stoichiometry of iron oxidation by O  2  . Initially formed Fe  3+  can further react with H  2  O  2  (producing protein bound radicals) but relaxes within seconds to an H  2  O  2  &#8208;unreactive di&#8208;Fe  3+  form. The data obtained suggest that the primary role of EcBfr  in vivo  may be to detoxify H  2  O  2  rather than sequester iron.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Electrocatalysis of MXene by&#160;Plasmon&#8208;induced Thermalization and Hot&#8208;electron Injection</title>
      <dc:description>The MXenes attract great interest in catalytic and energy applications but suffer from inferior redox activity. An efficient strategy is presented to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of MXenes for electrocatalysis in varied chemical environments by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The plasmonic MXenes induce a significant thermoplasmonic effect to reduce the endothermic enthalpy and potential barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared region. Simultaneous hot electron injection in a prolonged timescale of sub&#8208;femtosecond&#8208;picosecond also remarkably facilitates interfacial charge transfer and decreases the activation energy of the reaction. Both effects boost the HER activity of various types of MXenes for over 5 folds with improved kinetics and Faradaic efficiency in full pH range.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Selective Chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Suitable for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>C(  sp  3  )&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site&#8208;selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction&#8217;s exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

      <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2&#8208;3.8V with &gt;86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a &#8220;reversible&#8221; migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Interplay Between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>

      <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Reactivity: an Acidic Silane</title>
      <dc:description>Compounds of main&#8208;group elements such as silicon are attractive candidates for green and inexpensive catalysts.

We show that ring strain significantly contributes to this unusual acidity along with inductive and electrostatic effects.

      <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Among those systems a handful of shape&#8208;persistent organic cages were studied and rarely narcisstic or social self&#8208;sorting could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a  meso  cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso&#8208;cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of  d  in  = 3.3&#8208;3.5 nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500 m  2  /g after desolvation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable to highly diastereoselective alkene hydration of natural products, qualifying the protocol for late&#8208;stage chemical functionalization.

      <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanism of CO  2  photoreduction into methane was elucidated by the time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under  13  CO  2  , H  2  , and UV&#8211;visible light,  13  CH  4  was formed at a rate of 0.98 mmol h  &#8722;1  g  cat  &#8722;1  using Ni (10 wt%)&#8211;ZrO  2  that was effective at 96 kPa. Under UV&#8211;visible light irradiation, the  13  CO  2  exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO  2  , followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni  0  sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni  0  , which was reversibly heated to 394 K owing to the heat converted from light. Using D  2  O and H  2  , H/D ratio in the formed methane was in agreement with H/D ratio in reactant.

      <title>Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO2 utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO2 reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO2 molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes.

     alt="Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.&lt;/p&gt;
