         <title>Ethanol Synthesis by CO2 Photoreduction Catalyzed by Self&#8208;Optimized Ti&#948;+&#8208;Based Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Self&#8208;generated oxygen vacancy in TiO2&#8722;x brought by BNF leads to different electron densities of adjacent Ti sites which achieved C2H5OH record yield of 51.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a global selectivity of 99%.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 to ethanol (C2H5OH) is a promising carbon&#8208;neutral technology for renewable energy. Nevertheless, low efficiency of multielectron utilization and high C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier cause poor performance in C2H5OH production. Here, we report a TiO2&#8722;x/BNF (boron nitride flower) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction microreactor to steer the asymmetric Ti active sites configuration and redox potential, thereby enhancing the thermodynamic and kinetic formation of C2H5OH. The S&#8208;scheme TiO2&#8722;x/BNF heterostructure provides spatially separated sites for CO2 reduction and water oxidation with efficient charge carrier utilization. The flower&#8208;like structure of BNF improves the local concentration of *CO within microreactors originated from confinement effect to satisfy the coupling process. Self&#8208;generated oxygen vacancy in TiO2&#8722;x brought by BNF leads to different electron densities of adjacent Ti sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *CO and reduces the *CO&#8208;CHO formation energy. C2H5OH dehydration is often difficult within the hydrophilic TiO2&#8722;x/BNF microreactor, thus it tends to produce C2H5OH rather than C2H4. Through the synergizing effects, the well&#8208;constructed microreactor delivers an excellent C2H5OH production rate of 51.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 99% and unprecedented global stability. Our work can serve as inspiration for developing Ti&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 conversion to C2H5OH using solar energy.

         <title>Triplet Metallovinylidenes of Palladium and Platinum Based on a Chelating P/Diazoalkene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chelating diazoalkenes is presented and their coordination complexes with Pd and Pt are characterized. Irradiation triggers N2 loss and gives access to the first triplet metallovinylidenes spectroscopically characterized utilizing FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements. Structural verification is given by in crystallo X&#8208;ray diffraction while computational studies support the unique bonding of the new diradical class.








Abstract
Triplet carbenes featuring a metal adjacent to the carbene center (metallocarbenes; R&#9472;C&#9472;M) are an emerging class of diradicals within the field of reactive intermediates. Here, we report the synthesis of the first spectroscopically characterized triplet metallovinylidenes (R&#9472;C&#8594;M; M&#160;=&#160;Pt, Pd). The synthetic access is based on a rigid P/C chelating diazoalkene ligand and its coordination to Pt and Pd. The C/P chelating ligand geometrically constrains the R&#9472;C&#8594;M angle and inhibits free bending. Irradiation of the free diazoalkene ligand generates a triplet vinylidene, characterized by Q&#8208;band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Irradiation of the metal coordination complexes (Pt and Pd) affords triplet metallovinylidenes, which were characterized at low temperatures including photochemically triggered in crystallo X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements allowed the determination of the large triplet zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) with D values of 124.5&#160;cm&#8722;1 (Pt) and 8.0&#160;cm&#8722;1 (Pd) in excellent agreement with the electronic structure obtained by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Crossiguanipyrazines with Potent Activity Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioactivity&#8208;guided isolation of crossiguanipyrazines (CGPs) from Crossiella cryophila DSM 44230 revealed potent activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with no detected cytotoxicity. Stable isotope&#8208;labeling studies uncovered their distinctive biosynthetic origin, and the first total synthesis of CGP I was accomplished, enabling future optimization.








Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases, with rising antimicrobial resistance exacerbating the urgent need for new therapeutic agents. Here, we report the discovery of crossiguanipyrazines A&#8208;I, a rare family of potent anti&#8208;TB alkylpyrazines from the underexplored actinobacterium Crossiella cryophila DSM 44230. Crossiguanipyrazines (CGPs) feature an unusual 3&#8208;methoxyl&#8208;2,5,6&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;pyrazine scaffold with variable hydroxylation and N&#8208;prenylation. The stereochemistry of CGPs A&#8208;G was determined by Mosher's analysis and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Stable isotope&#8208;labeling revealed a unique biosynthetic origin from arginine and acetate. Inhibition with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor suppressed hydroxylation, while feeding experiments with stable isotope&#8208;labeled CGP I demonstrated its role as a precursor for other CGPs, implicating P450 enzymes in CGP diversification. CGPs C and H exhibited potent anti&#8208;TB activity in the low micromolar range without mammalian cell cytotoxicity, unlike previously reported cytotoxic trialkylpyrazine&#8208;type natural products. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies highlighted the critical roles of hydroxylation and N&#8208;prenylation in modulating biological activity. Furthermore, we achieved the first total synthesis of CGP I, which validated the chemical structure and provided a foundation for further optimization of this compound class. These findings suggest that CGPs can serve as useful starting points for anti&#8208;TB drug development.

         <title>Thiol&#8211;Ene Photoclick Chemistry for Efficient Bicyclic Peptide Synthesis and Genetically Encoded Peptide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry enables rapid, selective, and high&#8208;yield bicyclization of unprotected peptides under mild, biocompatible conditions, compatible with all amino acids and phage display, facilitating the discovery of high&#8208;affinity ligands for target proteins. 








Abstract
Bicyclic peptides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in chemical biology and drug discovery owing to their high target affinity, enhanced metabolic stability, and rigid conformational structure. Conventional bicyclization strategies often face challenges related to efficiency and chemoselectivity, which can limit their broader applicability. Here, we present the first application of thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry for the bicyclization of unprotected peptides, employing TAIC as a trifunctional crosslinker. This photochemical approach enables rapid, high&#8208;yield, and highly selective cyclization under mild, biocompatible conditions and is compatible with all proteinogenic amino acids. The reaction reaches completion within 6 minutes and is fully compatible with phage display, allowing high&#8208;throughput generation and selection of genetically encoded bicyclic peptide libraries. Using this platform, we identified two submicromolar ligands targeting cyclophilin A, both of which showed substantially improved binding affinity compared to their linear counterparts. These findings establish thiol&#8211;ene photoclick chemistry as a robust and versatile platform for the discovery of conformationally constrained peptide ligands, particularly suited for addressing therapeutically challenging protein&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Modeling of N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dioxide/Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Michael Additions</title>

A data&#8208;driven platform integrates curated data and mechanistic modeling to guide catalyst design for N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/metal&#8208;catalyzed Michael additions.








Abstract
Rational catalyst design and accurate selectivity prediction remain major challenges in asymmetric synthesis, which is critical for improving and innovating existing catalytic systems. Among them, chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/metal complexes have emerged as a powerful and broadly effective class of privileged catalysts, yet systematic tools for understanding and optimizing their performance remain underdeveloped. Here, we present an integrated data platform that unifies literature curation, mechanistic modeling, and predictive analytics to support intelligent catalyst selection for asymmetric N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/metal&#8208;catalyzed Michael additions. We curated over 2,000 reactions from two decades of research into a chemically annotated, machine&#8208;readable dataset encompassing catalyst structure, reaction conditions, and stereochemical outcomes. This dataset enabled global statistical analyses of application patterns across metal&#8211;ligand&#8211;substrate combinations and supported a modeling framework that combines intermediate&#8208;informed data augmentation with similarity&#8208;weighted tuning, which improved predictive ability on reactions involving previously unseen substrates. Comprehensive experimental validations covering diverse substrates, ligands, and metals confirmed the model's robustness and transferability across a wide selectivity range, including the accurate identification of new highly enantioselective transformations. These findings highlight the value of data&#8208;integrated platforms in advancing the development of new reactions within complex asymmetric systems and provide an intelligent framework for future expansion of the N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phase Protection Suppresses Bi Leaching for Durable Acidic CO2 Electroreduction to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly durable BiCu bimetallic catalyst for acidic CO2 electroreduction to formic acid is developed via a metal phase&#8208;protection strategy. The interphase interaction between CuBi2O4 and Bi2O3 results in compressive strain and lattice contraction in the Bi2O3 phase, effectively strengthening the Bi&#9472;O bonds. This structural modulation suppresses Bi leaching during electrochemical reconstruction and preserves more Bi2O2CO3 active phases, thereby improving the long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming the common Bi2O3 catalyst.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolyte mitigates salt precipitation and carbon loss compared to that in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. However, the harsh acidic environments cause metal leaching and catalyst degradation, thereby impairing activity and long&#8208;term durability. Here we propose a metal&#8208;phase protection strategy that enables in situ formation of a BiCu catalyst (Bi0.31Cu1) with impressive durability for acidic CO2RR to formic acid (HCOOH). The compressive strain of the Bi2O3 phase in Bi0.31Cu1, induced by its interaction with the CuBi2O4 phase, enhances Bi&#9472;O bond strength and mitigates Bi leaching during in situ electrochemical reconstruction, thus delivering highly desired activity and durability. The Bi0.31Cu1 catalyst achieves a HCOOH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of above 90% in a wide current density range from 200 to 650&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In a 0.5&#160;M KCl electrolyte with pH 2, the Bi0.31Cu1 catalyst can continuously produce HCOOH with a FE of around 90% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500 h. This work showcases the great promise of the metal&#8208;phase protection strategy for minimizing metal leaching and improving the long&#8208;term durability of acidic CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Boolean Logic&#8208;Based Controlled Release of Bioactive Proteins with Diversified Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We recombinantly express autonomously compiling Boolean logical operators enabling controlled release of therapeutically relevant proteins in response to precise user&#8208;defined combinations of environmental inputs. Here, we demonstrate that growth factors, enzymes, nanobodies, de novo&#8208;designed cytokines, and fluorescent proteins can be proteolytically and/or photochemically released while retaining native bioactivity. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials hold great promise in controlled therapeutic delivery, tissue engineering, and biosensing applications. Recently, molecular assembly via autonomous compilation has been employed to create topologically specified protein cargos that can be site&#8208;specifically tethered to and conditionally released from biomaterials following user&#8208;programmable Boolean logic. Prior implementation has been confined to simple fluorescent protein outputs and model protease inputs. In this manuscript, we extend the applicability of this framework by assembling all 7 unique logical operations emanating from a YES/OR/AND 3&#8208;input operator set to deliver bioactive proteins spanning diverse categories: growth factors (epidermal growth factor), model enzymes (&#946;&#8208;lactamase, NanoLuciferase, and thioredoxin A), therapeutic nanobodies (anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), de novo&#8208;engineered cytokines (Neoleukin), and fluorescent proteins (mGreenLantern). In so doing, we demonstrate programmable biomacromolecule release from material anchors in response to precise combinations of three orthogonal protease actuators while maintaining native bioactivity. Through inclusion of a photocleavable protein motif, we further establish that visible light can be employed as an additional input in specifying logic&#8208;based protein release. We anticipate these methods will powerfully expand opportunities for targeted therapeutic delivery and beyond.

         <title>Regulating the Li/Ni Mixing Ratio to Enhance Transition Metal&#8208;Lattice Oxygen Interaction for Achieving Long Life Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The modification mechanism of LLO through moderate Li/Ni mixing, including the enhancement of 3D Li+ transport channels, alleviation of lattice distortion, and reduction of O2 release.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) emerge as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their superior specific capacity characteristics. The similar ionic radii of Li+ (0.72 &#197;) and Ni2+ (0.69 &#197;) inevitably cause Li/Ni mixing. However, the relationship between Li/Ni mixing and the electrochemical performance of LLOs remains poorly understood. This study investigates LLOs with varying Li/Ni mixing ratios. The results indicate that an optimal increase in Li/Ni mixing can strengthen TM&#9472;O bond, reduce lattice strain, and thus enhance the cycling stability of LLOs. When the Li/Ni mixing further increases, Ni atoms tend to aggregate in the Li layer, which reduces the structural stability of LLOs and causes severe electrolyte decomposition. In comparison to the sample with lower Li/Ni mixing (1.90%), the LLOs with optimized Li/Ni mixing (4.07%) exhibit an enhancement in initial Coulombic efficiency from 83.0% to 87.4%, along with an improvement in capacity retention from 71.7% to 85.2% after 500 cycles at 1C. Moreover, the corresponding pouch cell maintains 82.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.3C. This study elucidates the impact of Li/Ni mixing ratio on the electrochemical performance of LLOs, providing valuable insights for synthesizing high&#8208;performance LLOs.

         <title>Unlocking Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Polar Organic Sulfonates through Connectivity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A connectivity&#8208;regulation approach for the construction of the deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparent alkali&#8208;metal organic sulfonate Li[SO3(CH2)2OH], which exhibit second&#8208;harmonic generation responses at both visible and ultraviolet regions as well as sufficient birefringence, was reported.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance ultraviolet nonlinear optical (UV NLO) crystals requires both highly efficient NLO&#8208;functional primitives and their optimal alignment within non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures&#8212;a dual challenge difficult to address. In this study, we present a connectivity&#8208;regulation approach for construction of polar organic salts, which has been experimentally verified by systematically varying either the counter&#8208;cations or, more efficiently, the anionic alkyl tails of aliphatic sulfonates. Compositional evolution drives change in alignment of the sulfonate anions from antiparallel in the parent centrosymmetric compound Li[SO3(CH2)2X](H2O) (X&#160;=&#160;Cl and Br) to staggered antiparallel in the polar analogues Na[SO3(CH2)2X](H2O) and then to parallel in Li[SO3(CH2)2OH], affording a connectivity&#8208;dependent enhancement in linear and nonlinear optical properties. Li[SO3(CH2)2OH] simultaneously exhibits an ultrawide bandgap (&gt; 6.53&#160;eV) and the largest second&#8208;harmonic generation among deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent sulfonates (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#160;nm), with sufficient birefringence to enable phase&#8208;matched fourth&#8208;harmonic generation at 266&#160;nm from Nd:YAG lasers. Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analyses suggest that the parallel alignment of the [SO3(CH2)2OH]&#8722; anions, facilitated through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions and ionic bonding, is responsible for the strong optical performance. This study highlights that structural connectivity change can profoundly influence key NLO properties, initiating a new avenue for development of high&#8208;performance UV NLO organic salts.

         <title>Crystal Packing&#8211;Trajectory Correlation in Topochemical Photoisomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines topochemical photoisomerization in salicylhydrazone crystals. Analysis of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and local free volume shows that adequate steric freedom near reactive bonds enables photochromism. Comparing slipped vs. cofacial stacking highlights how packing governs reactivity. We propose &#8220;pedal space&#8221; as a descriptor for predicting solid&#8208;state photoreactivity.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photoisomerization is often associated with loosely packed molecular arrangements that allow conformational flexibility. In this study, we explore this premise by synthesizing a library of salicylhydrazone derivatives, 16 of which were successfully crystallized and analyzed. Notably, several planarly close&#8208;packed crystals exhibited clear photochromic responses when their local environments provided sufficient steric freedom near the reactive bonds. By systematically examining &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking motifs and quantifying accessible volume along the isomerization trajectory, we reveal a robust correlation between local free volume and photoresponse. From these insights, we develop a crystal&#8208;structure based molecular descriptor that condenses the steric environment into a single&#8208;parameter, the &#8220;pedal space&#8221; and identify a critical threshold for solid&#8208;state photoreactivity. We term this phenomenon topochemical photoisomerization, highlighting how subtle variations in molecular packing, such as slipped versus co&#8208;facial stacking in N&#8208;salicylideneaniline derivatives, dictate the resulting photochemical pathways. This study establishes a structural framework for the rational design of solid&#8208;state photoswitchable materials through crystal&#8208;engineering principles in silico, offering a route toward rapid, and cost&#8208;effective development of responsive optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Iron (IV) Formation and the pH Dependent Kinetics of the Fenton Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kinetic framework captures the long&#8208;debated pH&#8208;dependent mechanism of the Fenton reaction. By incorporating iron speciation, the model quantitatively explains the shift from OH radical oxidation in acidic conditions to Fe(IV) formation near neutral pH. This framework corrects prior underestimations of rate constants and accurately reproduces the acceleration in iron oxidation by hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Despite its widespread importance for biological and environmental chemistry and decades of study, the mechanism underlying the Fenton reaction is still a matter of some controversy. To elucidate the pH dependence of this complex reaction, a new kinetic model is developed to explain the increase in rate and mechanistic shift that occurs from acidic to neutral conditions. This mechanism originated from a re&#8208;analysis of a previously proposed model, which neglected explicit iron speciation, leading to unrealistic rate constants. Accounting for speciation suggests a much faster formation rate of Fe(IV), which is estimated to be on the order of 106&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Expanding on prior kinetic studies that include speciation under acidic conditions, we propose a unified kinetic model that captures the pH&#8208;dependent rate acceleration in Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2, which is a significant step toward resolving the long&#8208;standing mechanistic ambiguity of Fenton chemistry.

         <dc:description>
Here, we realized highly enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral 6&#8208;membered silacycles with broad functional group compatibility by developing two nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive [4&#160;+&#160;2] cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dienes. Our strategy represents the first reductive cyclization involving both C&#8211;Si bond and C&#8211;C bond formation.









Abstract
Chiral organosilanes are increasingly important in synthetic, medicinal, and materials chemistry. However, the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral six&#8208;membered silacycles remains unexplored. Here, we report two nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive [4&#160;+&#160;2] cyclizations of 1,3&#8208;dienes using readily available chloromethyl chlorosilane or 1,2&#8208;dichlorodisilane as dielectrophiles, proceeding via distinct mechanisms. Our strategy represents the first reductive cyclization involving both C&#8211;Si bond and C&#8211;C bond formation and enables efficient and highly enantioselective access to &#945;&#8208;chiral silacyclohexenes and 1,2&#8208;disilacyclohexenes with broad functional group compatibility. Further derivatizations demonstrate the potential of this method for constructing valuable chiral silicon building blocks, underscoring its synthetic utility.

         <title>Tuning the Circularly Polarized Reflection from Cholesteric Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Using Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular photoswitches dispersed in a cholesteric hydroxypropyl cellulose mesophase enable reversible, light&#8208;driven tuning of structural color and polarization. Enantiomer&#8208;specific effects and light&#8208;responsive patterning highlight the potential of dynamic, cellulose&#8208;based photonic materials.








Abstract
Controlling the ordering of molecular liquid crystals using light has found widespread applications in reflectors, sensors, and tunable optical filters. In chiral liquid crystals such as cholesterics, introducing a molecular switch can alter chiral interactions between mesogens and thus affect the periodicity and photonic band responsible for the structural color of the material. However, analogous photo&#8208;control of cellulose&#8208;based cholesteric polymers has not been reported. Here, we investigate the addition of achiral and chiral switches to cholesteric mesophases of structurally colored hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and monitor changes in the photonic bandgap upon varying concentration, illumination, or temperature. While an achiral photoswitch enables reversible tuning of the reflected color upon trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization, chiral switches (with different pendant groups and R/S enantiomers) lead to substantial differences in pitch and polarized reflection during cycles of illumination or heating/cooling&#8211;attributed to the complex interplay between the chiralities of the switch and of the host mesophase. A final combination of chiral photoswitch and spiropyran enables independent control of reflected and transmitted color, which can be relevant for cellulose&#8208;based photonic displays, smart labels, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Realization of a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Ligand (HTL) Platform: Oxy Insertion at a Titanium&#8211;Alkyl Bond Facilitated by a Hydroxylaminato Ligand Framework</title>

         <dc:description>
A concept for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond functionalization: a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer Ligand (HTL) platform is demonstrated through oxygen insertion into a titanium&#8208;carbon bond using a hydroxylamide ligand. A synthetic cycle for HTL is presented including kinetic and computational studies.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of metal&#8208;carbon bonds is arguably one of the most important reactions in modern chemistry. In this work, we report the synthesis and the reactivity of a titanium alkyl complex [(TriNOx)Ti(CH2SiMe3)] (TriNOx3&#8722; = [(2&#8208;tBuNO)C6H4CH2]3&#160;N)3&#8211;) that was found to undergo an internal rearrangement through an oxy&#8208;insertion into the Ti&#9472;C bond facilitated by one of the hydroxylaminato moieties of the supporting TriNOx3&#8722; ligand. Experimental and computational studies are in agreement with an organometallic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger&#8208;type mechanism. Furthermore, stepwise dealkoxylation, reoxidation, and alkylation of the resulting complex allowed for closing a synthetic cycle and regenerating the initial starting complex. This work demonstrates the unique ability of the TriNOx3&#8722; ligand to mediate and manage O&#8208;atoms in the coordination sphere of a titanium cation and delineates a new type of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity through a Heteroatom&#8208;Transfer Ligand (HTL) platform.

         <title>Graphitic C6N6&#8208;Supported Dual Cu/Zn Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Mimicking Allosteric Regulation for Intelligent Switching Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switch between SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities of Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 with an efficiency of 90+% was obtained by alternating dark and light irradiation. Photoreduction along with different the Cu/Zn ratio adjusted the valence state and reduction potential, allowing the same active Cu center to perform distinctive switchable functions. This capability facilitated the detection of xanthine and glucose without crosstalk at a single sensing interface. 








Abstract
Self&#8208;adaptability is highly envisioned for artificial devices such as robots with chemical noses. To this end, seeking catalysts with reversibly switchable functions is promising but generally hampered by mismatched specific valence state of active centers for a certain type of catalytic activity. Herein, we report a graphitic C6N6&#8208;supported dual Cu/Zn single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6) with switchable functions triggered by light irradiation. Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 exhibited highly efficient distinctive superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like (POD) activity under dark and light, respectively. Moreover, such switch between SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities were reversible by alternating dark and light irradiation with an efficiency more than 90%. The comprehensive experimental and TD&#8208;DFT calculations disclosed that both illumination and the Cu/Zn doping ratio modulate the reduction potential (&#966;red) by altering the potential energy surface and frontier orbital energies, thereby fine&#8208;tuning the SOD activity, making distinctive SOD&#8208; and POD&#8208;like activities originated from the same active center (Cu&#8208;Nx) but with different valence states, triggered by photoreduction. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Cu/Zn&#8208;C6N6 was further confined to a microfluidic chip and applied to an intelligent single&#8208;interface biosensor with reversibly switched ability in detecting xanthine and glucose in vitro.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Aqueous Polymerization Enables in Situ Formation of Biocompatible, High&#8208;Performance Organic Mixed Conductors for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, initiator&#8208;free aqueous photopolymerization of a PEDOT (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)) analogue precursor yields biocompatible, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor, enabling direct fabrication of high&#8208;performance bioelectronic devices without the use of harmful oxidants.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) are a class of materials offering unique coupled dual charge transport characteristics along with appealing properties including mechanical softness, biocompatibility, tunability, volumetric capacitance, and stability. These features have been exploited in devices including organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), neuromorphic computing, energy storage, sensors, neural electrodes, and actuators. Conventionally, OMIEC polymers are prepared through chemical, vapor&#8208;phase, electrochemical, or enzymatic polymerization, typically relying on oxidants, metal catalysts, and/or organic solvents, significantly limiting their scalability, sustainability, and biocompatibility. Here, we introduce an initiator&#8208;free, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced polymerization of water&#8208;soluble conducting polymer precursors, enabling facile formation of high&#8208;performance and inherently biocompatible OMIECs. This novel approach allows direct photopatterning and seamless film deposition and manufacturing of OECTs across rigid, flexible, and biological substrates, exemplified by glass, textiles, and mouse skin (in vivo). Through careful optimization of the photopolymerization process, resulting OMIECs possess state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrical, electrochemical, and device properties along with exceptional compatibility and conformability with various flexible and biological surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these photopatterned electrodes, manufactured directly on mouse skin in vivo, where they significantly enhance the recording efficacy and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of low&#8208;frequency brain activity in anesthetized mice.

         <title>Inactivation of the Burkholderia Toxin Malleicyprol by Enzymatic Cyclopropanol Ring Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are dangerous pathogens that cause severe diseases with high mortality rates. Their virulence relies in part on malleicyprols, potent toxins containing a highly reactive cyclopropanol group. In this study, we identify BurK, a heme&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase that neutralizes malleicyprols by enzymatically opening the cyclopropanol ring.








Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria of the Burkholderia pseudomallei group cause life&#8208;threatening infections in humans and animals. Their virulence factors include malleicyprols bearing a reactive cyclopropanol moiety essential for toxicity. Inactivating this reactive motif, therefore, is a promising way to neutralize these toxins. Here, we identify a heme&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase (BurK) that cleaves the cyclopropanol warhead. Mutational analyses and in vivo radical capturing show that BurK catalyzes a radical ring opening to yield a propanone fragment. Characterizing BurK orthologs across various bacterial phyla suggests broader ecological roles of these unusual enzymes. Using a nematode model, we demonstrate that BurK&#8208;producing helper bacteria neutralize malleicyprols, significantly reducing toxicity and enhancing host survival. In addition to uncovering a novel biocatalyst, this work lays the foundation for antivirulence approaches using therapeutic microbes against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored on Multicomponent Metal Oxides for Enhanced Chlorine Evolution and Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst was designed for the simultaneous chlorine evolution reaction and reactive oxygen species generation. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self&#8208;designed continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min. This study provides guidance for reducing the fabrication cost of commercial DSA electrodes and enabling their application in advanced electrochemical oxidation processes. 








Abstract
The electrochemical production of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers potential for water treatment. Although chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and ROS generation had been widely investigated in acidic media, further exploration was warranted under tap&#8208;water conditions. In this study, a ruthenium single&#8208;atom&#8208;based electrocatalyst (Ru SAs/IrCeOx/Co3O4) was developed, which achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% for CER in acidic electrolyte and demonstrated stable operation for 1750&#160;h at 625&#160;mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 during an accelerated durability test. The electrocatalyst generated 1.4&#160;ppm total oxidants within 2&#160;min in simulated tap water, and showed stability for 1630&#160;h in a medium&#8208;salinity electrolyte. Theoretical analyses demonstrated that Ru SAs/Co3O4 surface lowered the thermodynamic barrier for Cl2 formation, the moderate chlorine adsorption energy of IrO2 establishes an electrocatalytic interface for the reaction system, CeO2 facilitated the spontaneous generation of *O species and promoted O&#8208;O coupling, endowing the electrocatalyst with bifunctional activity toward both CER and ROS production under simulated tap water conditions. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self&#8208;designed continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min.

&lt;p&gt;A novel electrocatalyst was designed for the simultaneous chlorine evolution reaction and reactive oxygen species generation. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self-designed continuous-flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min. This study provides guidance for reducing the fabrication cost of commercial DSA electrodes and enabling their application in advanced electrochemical oxidation processes. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical production of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers potential for water treatment. Although chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and ROS generation had been widely investigated in acidic media, further exploration was warranted under tap-water conditions. In this study, a ruthenium single-atom-based electrocatalyst (Ru SAs/IrCeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was developed, which achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% for CER in acidic electrolyte and demonstrated stable operation for 1750&#160;h at 625&#160;mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; during an accelerated durability test. The electrocatalyst generated 1.4&#160;ppm total oxidants within 2&#160;min in simulated tap water, and showed stability for 1630&#160;h in a medium-salinity electrolyte. Theoretical analyses demonstrated that Ru SAs/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; surface lowered the thermodynamic barrier for Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation, the moderate chlorine adsorption energy of IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; establishes an electrocatalytic interface for the reaction system, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; facilitated the spontaneous generation of *O species and promoted O-O coupling, endowing the electrocatalyst with bifunctional activity toward both CER and ROS production under simulated tap water conditions. The electrocatalyst, coupled with a self-designed continuous-flow electrolyzer, achieves 95% pollutant degradation within 30&#160;min. This study provides guidance for reducing the fabrication cost of commercial DSA electrodes and enabling their application in advanced electrochemical oxidation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Medicinal Chemistry: A C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Fragment Toolbox for Redox&#8208;Neutral Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is introduced in this report a unified toolbox comprising of 15 sulfonyl hydrazide reagents that enable the redox&#8208;neutral radical cross&#8208;coupling of 14 distinct C(sp3)&#8208;rich small fragments onto (hetero)arenes, providing a modular, efficient, and operationally simple platform for installing diverse small fragments. The platform has the potential to accelerate medicinal chemistry campaigns, enables late&#8208;stage modifications, and positions it as a useful resource for drug discovery.








Abstract
The hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead phase of drug discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the time&#8208;consuming, iterative synthesis of analogs, especially when incorporating small C(sp3)&#8208;rich fragments such as methyl, cyclopropyl, or oxetanyl groups&#8212;moieties known to improve drug solubility, bioactivity, and metabolic stability. Conventional approaches like Suzuki or Negishi couplings make use of unstable reagents, high costs, and harsh reaction conditions, while many modern radical&#8208;based methods rely on exogenous redox agents or costly metal catalysts. To overcome these limitations, a toolbox of 15 sulfonyl hydrazide reagents is disclosed to facilitate redox&#8208;neutral, nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical cross&#8208;coupling of 14 distinct small fragments onto (hetero)arenes under mild conditions. These crystalline, bench&#8208;stable reagents are straightforward to synthesize from accessible precursors and require no additional oxidants, reductants, or precious metals, offering a modular and operationally simple platform. Demonstrated across a diverse set of over 60 (hetero)aryl halides, the method exhibits exceptional substrate scope and functional group tolerance, accommodating complex, medicinally relevant scaffolds. Comparative studies with existing techniques underscore its advantages, including a 51% yield for trideuteromethylation of a MET kinase inhibitor precursor (versus a precedented 14% via Kumada coupling) and a streamlined one&#8208;step cyclobutylation of an NLRP3 inhibitor intermediate at 41% yield (versus a known&#160;&lt;&#160;5% over a four&#8208;step sequence).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a high yielding synthesis of enantiopure [3]cyclorubicene, which is a potential precursor for a Haeckelite nanotube. This macrocycle was studied for its electronic and chiroptical properties and exhibits one of the highest dissymmetry values reported for a nanohoop. 








Abstract
The interest in chiral nanohoops and nanotubes as well as their chiroptical properties has steadily increased in recent years. The synthesis of pentagon containing enantiopure [3]cyclorubicenes, which are cutouts and potential precursors of chiral Haeckelite nanotubes is presented, based on enantiopure &#8220;corner units&#8221;. The resulting enantiopure nanohoops were studied for their electronic and chiroptical properties with one of the highest dissymmetry values reported for CPPs of up to 2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Synthesis of Immunogenic Mycobacterial Lipoproteins via Aryl Selenoester&#8208;Mediated Expressed Protein Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes a powerful semi&#8208;synthetic strategy for producing native lipoproteins using peptide selenoesters. Two mycobacterial lipoproteins, LprA and Mpt83, were generated through this method and shown to activate Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 and activate immune responses. The aryl selenoester&#8208;mediated expressed protein ligation method reported here offers a general platform for generating homogeneous lipoproteins in the future.








Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide. Despite decades of dedicated efforts to develop effective prevention strategies, including vaccines, TB continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. Beyond the Bacille Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine, limited progress has been made to develop more effective TB vaccines. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory roles of key Mtb protein virulence factors is therefore needed for the development of more efficacious protein&#8208;based vaccine candidates. Herein, we report a highly efficient method for the semi&#8208;synthesis of two native mycobacterial lipoproteins and glycolipoproteins, LprA and Mpt83, respectively. Capitalising on the enhanced reactivity of peptide selenoesters as acyl donors, the 21&#8211;23&#160;kDa homogeneously lipidated proteins could be generated in a single ligation step. The homogeneous mycobacterial lipoprotein and glycolipoprotein molecules were shown to be agonists of Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2) and led to the potent induction of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in cells. Taken together, this work presents a robust semi&#8208;synthetic platform for accessing lipoproteins involved in host&#8211;pathogen interactions that can help guide future TB vaccine design.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Thermal Response of Visible/NIR Emission in Er3+&#8208;Doped Layered Perovskite via Modulating Thermally Induced Oxygen Vacancies and Cross Relaxation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Er3&#8314;&#8208;doped Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O0.5Cl layered perovskite oxyhalide exhibits unconventional thermally enhanced near&#8208;infrared upconversion (133&#8208;fold intensity gain at 494&#160;K) alongside quenched green/red emissions. Synergistic oxygen vacancy modulation and cross&#8208;relaxation enable record&#8208;high thermometric sensitivity (72.26% K&#8722;1) via fluorescence intensity ratio, showcasing a breakthrough for high&#8208;performance optical temperature sensing.








Abstract
Overcoming thermal quenching remains a pivotal challenge for the practical application of upconversion luminescence (UCL) materials. Herein, a novel UCL material based on Er3+&#8208;doped layered perovskite oxyhalide Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O8Cl is demonstrated to exhibit a unique dual thermal&#8208;response behavior: conventional thermal quenching of green/red emissions alongside remarkable thermally enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UCL within the temperature range of 293&#8211;493&#160;K. Under 980&#160;nm excitation, the NIR UCL intensity (4I9/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) in Bi4Ti0.5W0.5O8Cl:10%Er3+ at 493&#160;K reached 133&#8208;fold that at 293&#160;K. The opposite thermal response is attributed to the synergistic effects of tunable oxygen vacancy concentrations and optimized cross&#8208;relaxation processes at elevated temperatures. By leveraging the opposing thermal responses of Er3+ emissions, an ultrahigh absolute sensitivity of 72.26% K&#8722;1 was achieved at 493&#160;K based on the fluorescence intensity ratio of the NIR (4I9/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) to green (4S3/2 &#8594; 4I15/2) transitions, demonstrating exceptional performance for highly sensitive optical thermometry. This work not only provides a new strategy for designing thermally enhanced UCL materials but also underscores the great potential of layered perovskite oxyhalides as advanced platforms for optical temperature sensing.

         <title>Hybrid Planar&#8211;Twisted Chair&#8208;Shaped Indoline Donor Enabling Bright Molecular and Aggregated State Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique chair&#8208;conformation donor engineering strategy was developed to construct NIR fluorophores with high brightness and various&#8208;state emission. Its hybrid planar&#8211;twisted geometry enhances donor strength, narrows the HOMO&#8211;LUMO bandgap, and suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, thereby improving light absorption and emission efficiency compared to classical donors, showing great promise in optical and biomedical applications.








Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) architectures have emerged as a preeminent paradigm in optoelectronic engineering and biomedical applications. However, conventional D&#8211;A NIR emitters often suffer from aggregation&#8208;induced quenching or weak absorption owing to the use of planar (e.g., carbazole) or highly twisted (e.g., triphenylamine) donor units, which impairs their versatile utility in molecular and aggregated states. Herein, we proposed a unique chair&#8208;shaped indoline donor (cID) with a hybrid planar&#8211;twisted conformation, which affords bright various states (solution, solid, microspheres, nanoparticles, and films) NIR emission spanning 650&#8211;1200&#160;nm, with tails extending to 1600&#160;nm. The cID donor promotes electron localization, imparting higher oscillator strength and a smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap to the designed NIR fluorophores, which together enhance light&#8208;harvesting capacity and induce red&#8208;shifted emission. Meanwhile, the sterically hindered nonconjugated group in cID effectively restricts low frequency vibration&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative decay, as evidenced by the reduced reorganization energy and Huang&#8211;Rhys factor in both isolated and crystalline phase. Through structurally &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, these NIR fluorophores exhibit robust various&#8208;state NIR&#8208;I (photoluminescence quantum yields up to 67.8% and brightness up to 15668 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) and NIR&#8208;II emission, which allows diverse advanced applications in porous ceramic damage detection, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, and NIR&#8208;II vascular imaging, thereby positioning cID as a versatile toolkit to create a novel NIR dye library for biomedical and optoelectronic field.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nickel&#8208;Catalyst Activation in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Abrasion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the role of mechanical abrasion in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions under ball&#8208;milling conditions. We demonstrate that common solids and abrasives, including Celite, BaTiO3, MgO, diamonds, and tungsten carbide, contribute to the abrasion of stainless steel, which then serves as a reductant to enable Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling under mechanochemical conditions, thus pointing out abrasion as an important factor to consider in mechanochemical synthesis.








Abstract
In this study, we unravel the noninnocent role of mechanical abrasion in mechanochemical cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by nickel salts, demonstrating that abrasion of stainless steel in ball milling efficiently activates nickel catalysts even in the absence of piezoelectric redox materials or intentionally added zerovalent&#8208;metal reductants. The abrasion is facilitated by the addition of solid additives, which include Celite, BaTiO3, MgO, diamond, and tungsten carbide powders. Detailed scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed the formation of zerovalent iron&#8208; and chromium&#8208;coated heterogeneous particles during ball milling, which activate nickel salts catalyzing cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings challenge the common view of ball&#8208;milling equipment as being an inert material, demonstrating the importance of mechanical phenomena along with the chemical composition of ball&#8208;milling materials typically used in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Flexible Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite Ferroelectric Thin Film for Efficient Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality, flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films (Benzylamine)2CsPb2Br7 are manufactured for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 693 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, along with stable output under 1000 bending cycles and large bending angles. The work first reports the flexible ferroelectric single crystal for self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, shedding light on future practical applications.








Abstract
Flexible X&#8208;ray detectors with a direct&#8208;conversion working mode have attracted tremendous attention in security checks, medical diagnostics, industrial inspection, and scientific research. As promising flexible X&#8208;ray detection materials, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) offer significant advantages, including efficient X&#8208;ray absorption, excellent charge transport, and cost&#8208;effective processing. However, reported flexible OIHP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors are predominantly limited to polycrystalline materials, which suffer from unavoidable grain boundaries, high defect densities, and poor charge mobility. Herein, we successfully fabricate flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films for efficient self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, leveraging the weak van der Waals interactions within the 2D perovskite layers of (benzylamine)2CsPb2Br7, high&#8208;quality, flexible single&#8208;crystal films are manufactured by mechanical exfoliation. Capitalizing on the intrinsic spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric photovoltaics, our flexible device demonstrates exceptional X&#8208;ray sensitivity (693 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) under zero bias, along with stable output under 1000 bending cycles and different bending angles. As the first demonstration of non&#8208;planar self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection in flexible single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric thin films, this work provides a foundation for future wearable X&#8208;ray detection systems.

         <title>Pseudohalide&#8208;Guided Redox Control Enables Electrochemical Auto&#8208;Tandem Nickel Catalysis for Butafulvene Synthesis.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a conceptually novel electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed transformation that enables the direct conversion of propargyl carbonates into butafulvenes through a tandem reductive coupling&#8208;oxidative cyclization sequence. Mechanistic studies reveal that pseudohalide ligands guide the redox state of nickel, enabling selective Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalysis under electroreductive conditions.








Abstract
Electrochemical nickel catalysis offers a unique platform for redox&#8208;controlled reactivity, yet its application to tandem catalysis remains underexplored. We report the development, mechanistic elucidation, and synthetic application of a conceptually novel electrochemical strategy that enables auto&#8208;tandem nickel&#8208;catalyzed (e&#8208;ATC) conversion of propargyl carbonates into butafulvenes, highly strained, antiaromatic scaffolds with limited synthetic accessibility. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations reveal that this transformation merges a reductive coupling with a mechanistically distinct cycloisomerization, both mediated by a single nickel catalyst under electroreductive conditions. Crucially, pseudohalide ligands play a central role in steering a controlled Ni(0)/Ni(II) redox manifold by suppressing one&#8208;electron Ni(I) pathways, thereby favoring a polar two&#8208;electron mechanism. The method enables broad access to butafulvenes, including fused&#8208;ring variants that are inaccessible by previous catalytic routes. Further derivatizations demonstrate the synthetic utility of these butafulvenes as precursors to strained dendralenes and complex polycyclic frameworks.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Carbonylative Ketone Synthesis Employing a Radical Sorting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolytic&#8208;Ni&#8208;catalyzed general synthesis of ketones was reported, utilizing radicals and carbon monoxide as partners. The radical sorting effect was proposed within an outer sphere addition mechanism of alkyl radicals to Ni&#8208;stabilized ketyl radicals, thereby facilitating selectivity among different radicals. This protocol allows for a broad range of alkyl combinations, including numerous 13C&#8208;labeled amino acids and steroids.








Abstract
The construction of ketones with bulky units is a long&#8208;standing challenge for established nucleophilic addition or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling. In this work, a different route is reported to build bulky ketones ab initio that exploits the radical sorting effect in three&#8208;component cross coupling with electrolytic Ni catalysis. The sorting effect enables the selective construction of ketones, including all possible combinations of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl groups. In particular, the radical sorting pathway allows for efficient CO utilization and the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled ketones with a minimum amount of 13CO. In addition, square wave voltammetry was adopted as a quick tool to identify the catalyst driving both electron transfer and bond formation.

&lt;p&gt;An electrolytic-Ni-catalyzed general synthesis of ketones was reported, utilizing radicals and carbon monoxide as partners. The radical sorting effect was proposed within an outer sphere addition mechanism of alkyl radicals to Ni-stabilized ketyl radicals, thereby facilitating selectivity among different radicals. This protocol allows for a broad range of alkyl combinations, including numerous &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled amino acids and steroids.

         <title>Overcoming Hydrophobicity with Water Enables Ultrafast Hydrolysis of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate at Very Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entrapping water within the microstructure of hydrophobic PET unlocks ultrafast hydrolysis under remarkably mild conditions. The approach demonstrates a rare combination of high chemical efficiency, low environmental burden, and strong potential for scale&#8208;up &#8212; significantly advancing the prospects for sustainable recycling of condensation polymers.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastics holds great promise but remains constrained by sustainability issues, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) epitomizing this challenge. Herein, we introduce a conceptually novel strategy that overcomes PET's intrinsic hydrophobicity by physically re&#8208;engineering the polymer's microstructure to enable ultrafast alkaline hydrolysis under exceptionally mild conditions. We leverage the ability of propylene carbonate (PC)&#8212;an inexpensive, commercial, green solvent&#8212;to selectively dissolve PET, to thermally induce phase separation, and subsequently act as a carrier for water insertion between polymer chains. Upon complete PC replacement, the water uptake exceeds twice the polymer mass, preventing chain re&#8208;compaction and establishing an interfacial environment that facilitates hydroxyl ion diffusion to ester bonds and depolymerization with minimal alkali consumption. As a result, water&#8208;swollen PET fully depolymerizes (96% TPA yield) at atmospheric pressure within 5&#160;min at 90 &#8728;C$^{\circ }{\rm C}$ or under 2&#160;h at room temperature, vastly outperforming conventional hydrolysis methods. The process achieves a &gt;$&gt;$20&#8208;fold reduction in energy footprint versus direct PET hydrolysis. It performs robustly on challenging, real&#8208;world feedstocks&#8212;including textiles and mixed plastic waste&#8212;enabling selective depolymerization unaffected by PET crystallinity. A techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirms energy efficiency and strong economic feasibility, demonstrating overall competitiveness with existing engineered technologies. Beyond PET, the physical mechanism underpinning the strategy offers a scalable and sustainable platform for recycling a wide range of condensation&#160;polymers.

         <title>A Molecular Machine Directs the Synthesis of a Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven molecular machine winds a flexible strand around a rigid axle to synthesize a rotaxane. This machine&#8208;directed approach enables access to molecular shapes previously unattainable by assembly or templating, demonstrating a generalizable strategy for expanding the chemical space of mechanically bonded molecules.








Abstract
Preorganization by assembly or templating strategies is frequently used in the synthesis of rotaxanes. While these approaches have led to complex interlocked molecules, they are often limited by strict compositional requirements of templates and starting materials. Here, we use a molecular machine to direct the synthesis of a rotaxane by active shaping of starting materials through mechanical winding. Light induced rotation of a molecular motor actively winds a molecular strand around an axle, forming discrete, thermodynamically disfavored crossings between these two parts. Covalent capture preserves the kinetically stable entanglements, transforming the strand into a macrocycle that is subsequently released and mechanically trapped on the axle, yielding a rotaxane. Our machine&#8208;directed strategy pioneers a new way of synthesizing rotaxanes by active mechanical shaping of molecular building blocks, enabling access to interlocked architectures beyond the reach of traditional assembly and templating approaches.

         <title>Azobenzene/Triptycene&#8208;Based Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral, photoswitchable dopants composed of triptycene and azobenzene exhibit exceptionally large helical twisting powers that change dramatically upon isomerization when incorporated into the liquid crystal (LC) host 5CB. By modulating the cholesteric pitch of the LC through light irradiation at different wavelengths, and reversing the effect thermally, the reflected light wavelength can be precisely tuned, yielding reversible, multicolored displays.








Abstract
The noncovalent interactions in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) can be modulated using switchable chiral dopants resulting in the phototuning of the reflected structural color. The nature of the interactions between the CLC and dopant, and how the latter can effectively transfer chiral information to the former is still somewhat of a black box. To gain insights into the nature of these interactions, we conducted structure&#8211;property analysis of five photoswitchable chiral dopants comprised of triptycene as the chiral core and azobenzene as the switchable unit. Our findings show that this combination results in high (e.g., 127&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1) helical twisting power (&#946;&#160;) values (i.e., extent of chiral information transfer between dopant and host), with dispersion interactions and/or electron deficient aromatic units playing a crucial role in determining the&#160;value. The large change in &#946; values upon E/Z photoswitching enabled us to devise multicolor, high contrast LC films that reflect across the UV to infrared light range.

         <title>Using Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Orthogonally&#8208;Reactive Dispersants to Design Tough Nanostructured Materials: Application to Epoxy Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be efficiently performed in orthogonally reactive dispersants such as epoxides (DGEBA or ECC) to generate a range of reactive block copolymer dispersions displaying different morphologies. Subsequent polymerization of the epoxide dispersant (through epoxy&#8208;amine reaction or cationic photopolymerization) affords the preparation of (nano)structured epoxy networks with enhanced toughness.








Abstract
We report here how the polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach can be implemented in orthogonally reactive dispersants to afford the preparation of nanostructured polymer networks. Precisely&#8208;defined PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PLMA block copolymers self&#8208;assembling into different morphologies are first obtained in epoxy monomers through RAFT dispersion polymerization. The subsequent polymerization of the epoxide (through step growth or chain growth polymerization) affords the straightforward preparation of epoxy networks that integrate diverse BCP structures and exhibit significantly enhanced fracture toughness at extremely low block copolymer content (1%&#160;w/w).

         <title>Asymmetrically Fluorinated Alkoxysilane Single&#8208;Solvent Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS), which possesses both strong solvating group (&#9472;OCH3) and weakly solvating segment (&#9472;CF3), as a single solvent for lithium battery electrolytes. The optimal electrolyte with abundant contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) facilitates the formation of inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li surface and cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the NCM811 surface.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathodes (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) represent one of the most promising approaches to achieve high energy density up to 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. However, severe interfacial side reactions occur at both NCM811 cathode and lithium anode at ultrahigh voltages (&gt;4.6&#160;V). To address these issues, various electrolytes have been developed, but they still suffer from electrolyte decomposition, leading to moderate voltages and insufficient cycling. Herein, we introduce (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS) as an asymmetrically fluorinated single solvent, which incorporates both strongly solvating (&#9472;OCH3) and weakly solvating (&#9472;CF3) groups. The designed 2.1&#160;mol L&#8722;1 (M) LiFSI/TTMS electrolyte achieves excellent compatibility with both NCM811 cathode and Li metal anode due to its unique anion&#8208;dominating solvation structures and inorganic&#8208;rich interphase formation. Consequently, it enables stable cycling in the Li||NCM811 battery at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.8&#160;V, with 84.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles. Even under more aggressive conditions, including high temperature (60&#160;&#176;C) and anode&#8208;less configuration (N/P ratio&#160;=&#160;1.76), the Li||NCM811 battery exhibits remarkable capacity retention (&gt;80%) over 300 cycles. This work underscores the effectiveness of electrolyte engineering for developing ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycling battery systems.

&lt;p&gt;We propose (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS), which possesses both strong solvating group (&#9472;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and weakly solvating segment (&#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), as a single solvent for lithium battery electrolytes. The optimal electrolyte with abundant contact ion pairs (CIPs) and aggregates (AGGs) facilitates the formation of inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li surface and cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the NCM811 surface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-voltage lithium metal batteries with nickel-rich oxide cathodes (LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NCM811) represent one of the most promising approaches to achieve high energy density up to 500&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, severe interfacial side reactions occur at both NCM811 cathode and lithium anode at ultrahigh voltages (&amp;gt;4.6&#160;V). To address these issues, various electrolytes have been developed, but they still suffer from electrolyte decomposition, leading to moderate voltages and insufficient cycling. Herein, we introduce (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)trimethoxy silane (TTMS) as an asymmetrically fluorinated single solvent, which incorporates both strongly solvating (&#9472;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and weakly solvating (&#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. The designed 2.1&#160;mol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (M) LiFSI/TTMS electrolyte achieves excellent compatibility with both NCM811 cathode and Li metal anode due to its unique anion-dominating solvation structures and inorganic-rich interphase formation. Consequently, it enables stable cycling in the Li||NCM811 battery at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.8&#160;V, with 84.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles. Even under more aggressive conditions, including high temperature (60&#160;&#176;C) and anode-less configuration (N/P ratio&#160;=&#160;1.76), the Li||NCM811 battery exhibits remarkable capacity retention (&amp;gt;80%) over 300 cycles. This work underscores the effectiveness of electrolyte engineering for developing ultrahigh-voltage and long-cycling battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Selective Substitution for Structural Stabilization of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially selective multi&#8208;element substitution strategy stabilizes O3&#8208;type sodium layered oxides by enabling a well&#8208;regulated O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the strong anchoring effect of B and the pronounced B&#9472;O covalent bonding strengthen the P3 framework, resulting in superior high&#8208;temperature performance and long&#8208;term full&#8208;cell cyclability. 








Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal oxides are considered promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high capacity and favorable Na+ storage characteristics. However, their practical application is severely hindered by structural instability associated with multiphase transitions during electrochemical cycling. Herein, we propose a spatially selective multi&#8208;element substitution strategy that induces spatially differentiated distributions of Mg, Cu, Ti, and B, thereby enhancing structural robustness. This spatially differentiated substitution architecture synergistically improves structural stability by concurrently inhibiting interfacial degradation and strengthening the lattice framework. The optimized composition (NaNi0.4Mg0.05Cu0.05Mn0.3Ti0.2B0.05O2) enables a stabilized O3&#160;&#8594;&#160;P3 phase transition, which relieves lattice distortion and suppresses structural collapse upon cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals that the strong covalency of B&#9472;O bonds is crucial for anchoring the P3 framework. Hence, it delivers superior high&#8208;temperature performance in half cells and durable cycling in full cells (85% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.5 C within 1.9&#8211;3.9&#160;V). By elucidating the role of spatially selective substitution in structural stabilization, this work provides fundamental insights and paves the way for the design of advanced SIB cathodes.

         <title>Bypassing &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination: Excited&#8208;State Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) Coupling at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A selective arylation of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds in amides and alcohols has been achieved using photo&#8208;induced divalent palladium catalysis at room temperature. This current approach enables C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling utilizing aryl iodides as both hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and arylating agents, effectively bypassing the common &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and annulation pathways.








Abstract
Catalytic modification of C&#8722;H bonds using palladium is highly appealing, but transformations involving alkyl&#8208;Pd(II) intermediates with &#946;&#8208;hydrogens are challenging due to the propensity for &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. To address this, selective arylation of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds in amides and alcohols has been achieved using divalent palladium as an excited&#8208;state transition metal (TM) species at room temperature. Our approach unveils a non&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral pathway to achieve C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings, utilizing aryl iodides as both hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and arylating agents for the first time under Pd&#8208;photochemical conditions. The mechanism involves photo&#8208;induced Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed aryl radical generation, HAT, and aryl migration, effectively bypassing the common &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and annulation pathways. Mechanistic investigations using isotope&#8208;labeled compounds and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the mechanistic rationale, affirming both the feasibility and intricacies of this effective transformation.

         <title>Emergent Chemical Reactivity and Complexity of RNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA condensates capable of substrate enrichment and catalysis modulate their environment. Could this start a catalytic selection loop or evolution?








Abstract
The RNA world hypothesis posits the existence of life&#8208;like assemblies that consisted mostly of RNA. However, questions remain regarding the emergence of RNA catalysis, stability, reactant availability, and compartmentalization of genetic material. At acidic pH, short RNAs (average &#8776;$\approx$ 20 nt) readily phase&#8208;separate into a condensed phase enriched with long RNA. These RNA condensates stably compartmentalize RNA as well as DNA and maintain stable identities even in the absence of membranes. Additionally, the RNA condensates concentrate ions, small molecules, phospholipids, peptides, ribozymes, and proteins. Beyond enriching such diverse components, RNA condensates function as microreactors with two catalytic capabilities: they physically enhance reaction rates by concentrating reactants within a confined space and simultaneously act as inherent catalysts that directly facilitate chemical transformations. RNA condensates can also support ribozyme and enzymatic activity. Together, these findings suggest that RNA phase separation may have played a crucial role in life's origins by providing compartmentalization, inherent catalytic activity, and molecular enrichment of long, potentially catalytic&#160;biopolymers.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Shell Engineering Enables Additive&#8208;Dominated Coordination for Stable Silicon Anodes Under Minimal Salt Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We establish a fluorinated additive&#8208;dominated solvation sheath structure via minimal concentration electrolyte (0.2&#160;M), which fully performs the SEI&#8208;forming functionality of additive and significantly enhances the structural/interfacial stability of Si anode. This strategy is expected to provide valuable guidance for designing cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrolytes.








Abstract
Constructing a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essential for enabling high&#8208;capacity alloying anodes in next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, conventional strategies based on high salt concentrations or expensive additives are limited by high cost, viscosity, and poor compatibility. Herein, we develop a solvation engineering strategy to increase the coordination number of additive molecules in the Li&#8314; solvation shell by minimizing anion participation. A low&#8208;salt electrolyte composed of 0.2&#160;M LiFSI (LiPF6) in DMM/THF/FEC (4:3:3 by vol%) enables additive&#8208;dominated coordination and facilitates the formation of a uniform, fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Characterizations including molecular dynamics simulations, spectroscopy, and 3D electrode reconstruction confirm this tailored solvation environment stabilizes the Si interface and mitigates volume&#8208;induced degradation. As a result, silicon anode exhibits a specific capacity of &#8764;2000&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 over 200 cycles, while graphite anodes retain 96% capacity after 500 cycles. Stable cycling performances can also be achieved in different pouch cells. This work underscores the critical importance of additive coordination control in electrolyte design and provides a broadly applicable, cost&#8208;effective strategy for advancing alloy&#8208;type anodes in practical LIB systems.

         <title>Direct C&#9472;H Lactonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by LMCT Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a photochemical method for oxidative &#947;&#8208;C&#9472;H lactonization of simple carboxylic acid substrates upon LMCT photoactivation. Intriguingly, these conditions suppress the rapid decarboxylation characteristic of oxidized carboxylates, suggesting the intermediacy of metal&#8208;stabilized acyloxy radical instead of the dissociative process typically invoked in LMCT photoactivations.








Abstract
Photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) activation of carboxylic acids has increasingly become recognized as a versatile platform for the development of synthetically useful new reactions. When the metal species is also capable of mediating an oxidative radical coupling process, this approach has been shown to be a powerful strategy for decarboxylative coupling of carboxylate feedstocks with diverse nucleophilic reaction partners. LMCT photoreactions that could engage the acyloxy radical intermediate in other canonical reactions of heteroatom&#8208;centered radicals such as 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) would broaden the scope of possible reactions. The rapid intrinsic rate of decarboxylation, however, presents a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the LMCT&#8208;promoted C&#9472;H lactonization of benzoic and aliphatic carboxylic acids. Mechanistic investigations suggest that under the optimized reaction conditions, the key acyloxy radical intermediate can be stabilized by the metal center, enabling 1,5&#8208;zHAT to outcompete decarboxylation.

         <title>The Biicosahedral Complex Anions [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Ag, Au): Synthesis and Unexpected Low&#8208;Temperature Phase Transition of [Ag(&#951;5&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722; to [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722;</title>

The unusually high oxidation state +V of Cu, Ag, and Au is stabilized by [B11H11]4&#8211;&#8208;based anions. For (n&#8208;Bu4N)3[Ag(B11H11)2], the crystal structures were determined for both isomers with Ag+I and Ag+V. 








Abstract
We disclose the synthesis and properties of [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Ag, Au) with the first gold&#8208;based anion [Au(B11H11)2]3&#8722;. The nido&#8208;[B11H11]4&#8722; ligand stabilizes complexes with copper, silver, and gold in the highest known oxidation state +V. The relative stability of [M+V(nido&#8208;B11X11)2]3&#8722;, [M+III(nido&#8208;B11X11)(closo&#8208;B11X11)]3&#8722;, and [M+I(closo&#8208;B11X11)2]3&#8722; isomers (X&#160;=&#160;H, F) was calculated at the DFT level. Unlike for [Cu(B11H11)2]3&#8722; and [Au(B11H11)2]3&#8722;, in case of [Ag(B11H11)2]3&#8722;, we discovered the equilibrium between the kinetically stable [Ag+V(nido&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722; (&#951;5) and kinetically labile [Ag+I(closo&#8208;B11H11)2]3&#8722; (&#951;2) by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The isomerization of the Ag complex shows signs of Ag(V)&#8211;Ag(I) redox processes. When a crystal is cooled, a phase transition occurs at 110&#8211;130&#160;K in which the coordination of the ligands on the silver changes from &#951;5 to &#951;2. The phase transition is reversible and upon heating to 170&#160;K, the &#951;2 to &#951;5 coordination is transformed. The reaction of [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; with HF leads to the partial substitution of hydrogen atoms by fluorine atoms to form [M(B11H11&#8722;xFx)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Au; x&#160;&#8776;&#160;4). We synthesized 18 compounds containing [M(B11H11)2]3&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Ag, Au) and their derivatives, followed by structural determination (X&#8208;ray crystallography). XANES data confirm the high oxidation state of Cu in K3[Cu(B11H11)2]&#183;5H2O.

         <title>Natural Resin Nanofilms through Flexible Coordination for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically robust natural resin nanofilms engineered through flexible coordination between rosin ligands and metal ions at interface enable durable and efficient molecular separation.








Abstract
Forestry biomass, with its diverse functionalities and abundant resources, holds great potential for the sustainable development of thin&#8208;film technologies. However, high brittleness arising from the rigid structural units of most forestry biomass materials significantly hinders thin&#8208;film processing. We demonstrate the transformation of rosin, a typical brittle forestry resin, into mechanically robust nanofilms with flexible chemical linkages. Carboxylic rosin derivatives solubilized in turpentine, a natural oleoresin solvent, were chemically assembled into nanofilms via interfacial coordination with aqueous metal ions. Tunable metal&#8208;rosin coordination enables precise structural modulation of nanofilms to achieve exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus&gt;120&#160;GPa) while its dynamic nature renders nanofilms high elasticity for pliable integration. The resulting nanofilm composite membranes exhibit durable and efficient molecular sieving during nanofiltration, with pressure resistance up to 20&#160;bar and superior permselectivity. As an emerging form of natural resin, these nanofilms may revolutionize the paradigm of biomass&#8208;based thin films by overcoming brittleness through flexibility.

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Ruthenium Alkylidyne Complexes Undergo Stepwise Rather Than Concerted [2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloadditions with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After decades of research into metal alkylidyne complexes and their extensive use as catalysts for alkyne metathesis, one might think that there is nothing fundamentally new to be discovered in this field. The present study into formally d4&#8208;configured Ru alkylidynes shows that this notion is incorrect: not only is a novel and convenient entry route disclosed but also an entirely unprecedented stepwise pathway for [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions is uncovered.








Abstract
A new entry into square&#8208;planar, formally d4&#8208;configured ruthenium alkylidyne complexes is disclosed, using p&#8208;tolyl(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane as a convenient and safe alkylidyne synthon. The method furnished complex 12 supported by an electron&#8208;rich PNP&#8208;pincer ligand, which undergoes remarkably facile [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and strained alkynes; these reactions represent the first examples of metallacyclobutadiene formation by a d4&#8208;configured transition metal alkylidyne complex. Strikingly, however, the cycloadditions proceed by a stepwise mechanism, which stands in marked contrast to the concerted pathway entertained by all prototypical d0 and d2 Schrock&#8208;type alkylidynes, including the molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium complexes that currently dominate the field of alkyne metathesis. In essence, it is the non&#8208;bonding lone pair forming the largely metal&#8208;centered HOMO of significant dz2 character that accounts for this unorthodox behavior. The newly gained insight into this key reactivity determinant also allows the few other known reactions of formally d4&#8208;configured alkylidene complexes previously described in the literature to be explained and will empower further explorations of their chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A new entry into square-planar, formally d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-configured ruthenium alkylidyne complexes is disclosed, using &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolyl(trimethylsilyl)diazomethane as a convenient and safe alkylidyne synthon. The method furnished complex &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt; supported by an electron-rich PNP-pincer ligand, which undergoes remarkably facile [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with electron-rich, electron-deficient, and strained alkynes; these reactions represent the first examples of metallacyclobutadiene formation by a d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-configured transition metal alkylidyne complex. Strikingly, however, the cycloadditions proceed by a stepwise mechanism, which stands in marked contrast to the concerted pathway entertained by all prototypical d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Schrock-type alkylidynes, including the molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium complexes that currently dominate the field of alkyne metathesis. In essence, it is the non-bonding lone pair forming the largely metal-centered HOMO of significant d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; character that accounts for this unorthodox behavior. The newly gained insight into this key reactivity determinant also allows the few other known reactions of formally d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-configured alkylidene complexes previously described in the literature to be explained and will empower further explorations of their chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Coordination&#8208;Dependent CO2 Reduction Activity of Bimetallic Cu&#9472;Al Catalysts for Selective Ethylene/Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While bimetallic catalysts enhance C2+ yield, product selectivity remains elusive. We demonstrate that atomic coordination governs the bifurcation at the *CHCOH intermediate: Cu/CuAlO2 interface&#8208;rich catalyst cleaves C&#8211;O to favor ethylene, whereas Al&#8208;doped Cu catalyst breaks Cu&#8211;C to boost ethanol. This structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, validated by spectroscopy and theory, establishes a design principle for selective CO2 electroreduction. 








Abstract
The formation of bimetallic catalysts has been widely adopted to improve CO2 reduction selectivity. However, discrepancies in product distribution in the literature, even among catalysts with identical bimetal compositions, suggest the involvement of distinct reaction pathways. Here, we report that ethylene and ethanol selectivity are strongly influenced by the atomic coordination of metals. We prepared two model catalysts, namely interface&#8208;CuAl (dominated by Cu/CuAlO2 interfaces) and doping&#8208;CuAl (with Al doped into the Cu lattice). Both catalysts demonstrate excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 65%&#8211;85%. However, interface&#8208;CuAl primarily produces ethylene with an FE of 67.6%, seven&#8208;fold higher than FEethanol. Conversely, doping&#8208;CuAl favors ethanol production, reaching a maximum FEethanol of 43.7%, four times higher than FEethylene. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometry reveal distinct adsorption abilities of Cu and different intermediate coverages. Complementary theoretical calculation further elucidates the critical role of *CHCOH bifurcation. Specifically, favorable C&#8211;O cleavage at interface&#8208;CuAl promotes ethylene production, whereas Cu&#8211;C scission at doping&#8208;CuAl favors ethanol production. Beyond CO2 electroreduction, CuAl catalysts also demonstrate phase&#8208;dependent nitrate reduction activity, underscoring the importance of atomic coordination in catalysis. This study provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship of bimetallic catalysts for selective chemical production.

         <title>Reversible Thermally Driven Phenyl Torsion in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Releases Strain for Heat&#8208;Resilient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that a thermally driven, reversible phenyl torsion in a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) hole transporting layer can serve as an interfacial molecular buffer. This mechanism alleviates perovskite residual strain introduced during fabrication and enables sustained strain dissipation under operational temperature variations. Consequently, inverted perovskite solar cells with Torsioner SAM exhibit significantly exceptional isothermal and thermocycling stability, as verified by the ISOS protocol.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) long&#8208;term stability remains constrained by intrinsic strain induced by thermal processes and fluctuating operating conditions. Here, we introduce a carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) hole transporting layer, (6&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)hexyl) phosphonic acid, termed as Torsioner SAM, which features reversible, thermally driven phenyl torsion behavior. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations confirm a dynamic, linear modulation of the torsion angle by 0.07&#176; K&#8722;1 within the critical temperature window spanning perovskite deposition and practical operation. The Torsioner SAM with two thermal driven phenyl units serves as a molecular buffer, effectively releasing residual strain caused by interfacial mismatch. Furthermore, the Torsioner SAM mitigates thermal activated lattice distortions and continuously dissipates additional strain under operational temperature variations. As a result, the corresponding devices exhibit markedly improved isothermal and thermocycling stabilities, retaining over 91.3% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocol and 94.4% after over 200 thermal cycles (25&#8211;85 &#176;C) under the ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;1 protocol. The incorporation of the Torsioner SAM also suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhances hole transport, yielding champion power conversion efficiencies of 26.26% (0.09 cm2) and 24.24% (1 cm2).

         <title>Three Conformations, Four Stimuli: Balancing Bond Order and Aromaticity in a Dual&#8208;BN Dihydrophenazine Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three states, four inputs: a diborylated dihydrophenazine (BNNB) links aromaticity changes to B&#9472;N bond rotations, giving bent, intermediate, and planar conformations. Heat, force, light, or redox changes select the states and yield distinct optical signals, including extremely Stokes&#8208;shifted emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. 








Abstract
Designing &#960; systems that respond to several stimuli or switch among multiple conformations remains challenging. A diborylated dihydrophenazine, in which aromaticity changes are coupled to internal B&#9472;N rotations, operates as a multistate optical switch addressable by heat, force, light, or redox inputs. The system exemplifies a new route to &#960;&#8208;conjugated multimodal switches, as reported by Tian et&#160;al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70012).

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Enhanced Anodes: A Scalable Solution to Transition&#8208;Metal Ion Crosstalk in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we pioneer an innovative, anode&#8208;centric strategy that leverages phosphorus's intrinsic &#8220;phagotrophic&#8221; properties to counteract TM&#8208;ion crosstalk. By immobilizing TM ions and maintaining solid electrolyte interphase stability, this unique property of phosphorus can revolutionize anode design, particularly in high&#8208;voltage batteries where TM dissolution is prevalent.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high&#8208;voltage transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxide cathodes and graphite and/or silicon anodes are widely recognized for their high energy density. However, such high&#8208;energy systems are often hindered by their poor cycling stability, especially due to anode failure caused by dissolved TM ions like Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. Herein, we discovered phosphorus's unique phagotrophic effect, which absorbs TM ions into its bulk phase rather than allowing them to accumulate on the anode surface that typically happens for graphite and silicon. This effect allows a hybrid anode design by incorporating down to 2&#160;wt.% phosphorus into graphite or silicon anodes, which is simple yet effectively prevents the TM&#8208;ion&#8208;induced decomposition of the electrolyte and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), even at high TM&#8208;ion concentrations (up to 100&#160;mM). Consequently, full cells with phosphorus&#8208;enhanced graphite or silicon anodes demonstrate remarkable extended cycling life. Importantly, this phosphorus&#8208;based TM&#8208;ion phagotrophic effect can be incorporated with standard electrode processing techniques for both graphite and silicon, ensuring seamless integration into existing LIB manufacturing. By improving the stability of graphite and silicon anodes across a variety of TM&#8208;oxide cathodes, this approach provides a practical and scalable solution for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy LIBs, offering both simplicity and transformative impact for battery technology.

         <title>2D Assemblies Based on a Tetraphenylethylene D,L&#8208;Cyclic Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new scaffold based on four nanotube&#8208;forming cyclic peptide units attached to a tetraphenylethene (TPE) core with pH&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly that provides light&#8208;emitting 2D nanosheets with controlled thickness is described.








Abstract
Two dimensional (2D) materials and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores have recently gained attention due to their unique properties and application potential. However, the combination of AIE probes into 2D self&#8208;assembled systems under nanometric control remains elusive due to the sensitivity of supramolecular assemblies to subtle changes in the monomer structure. Herein, we present a new scaffold based on four nanotube&#8208;forming cyclic peptide (CP) units attached to a tetraphenylethene (TPE) core whose pH&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly results in light&#8208;emitting 2D nanosheets. An oxime bond connection was exploited to synthesize a discrete library of tetrakis&#8208;(cyclopeptide) tetraphenylethene monomers that self&#8208;assemble into 2D macrotubular nanoarrays under the suitable external stimulus. This new tetrameric CP motif tolerates a broad range of molecular modifications, both on the peptide backbone and TPE core, without compromising the integrity of the 2D self&#8208;assembly. We also discovered that adjusting the molecular structure of the TPE aromatic core enabled precise height control of the supramolecular nanosheets. The alignment of the histidine residues within neighboring CPs allowed the application of 2D nanoarchitectures as enzyme mimics with esterase activity. The excellent tolerance to molecular diversity in both the external CP moiety and the internal aromatic AIE core, invites the design of new functional 2D supramolecular materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Carbonyl/Nitrogen Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enable Efficient Pure&#8208;Red Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused C&#9552;O/N&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance emitters with small energy gaps of 1.97&#160;eV are developed by integrating electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl and electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atom into a conjugated diene skeleton, giving pure&#8208;red narrowband electroluminescence at 628&#160;nm with small full&#8208;width at half maxima of 37&#160;nm, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiencies of 24.2% at maximum with very small roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) narrowband emitters are attractive for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, but their development is hindered by scarcity of red&#8208;emitting molecular skeletons. Here, we propose a new design strategy for efficient pure&#8208;red carbonyl/nitrogen (C&#9552;O/N) MR emitters, by integrating electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl (C&#9552;O) and electron&#8208;rich nitrogen (N) into a non&#8208;fused conjugated diene skeleton. Unlike the counterparts having fused polycyclic skeletons with only one C&#9552;C bond between adjacent C&#9552;O and N atoms, the non&#8208;fused MR emitters allow insertion of two conjugated C&#9552;C bonds between them, which not only lowers energy gap (1.97&#160;eV) to redshift emission, but also retains short&#8208;range charge transfer with atomically alternating highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) distributions along the diene framework to achieve narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence effect. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the emitters exhibit pure&#8208;red electroluminescence at 628&#160;nm with small full&#8208;width at half maxima (FWHMEL) of 37&#160;nm, together with high external quantum efficiencies of 24.2% at maximum and 23.8% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which to our best knowledge, makes them the first example of pure&#8208;red C&#9552;O/N MR emitters with FWHMEL below 40&#160;nm. The results provide new insight for developing long&#8208;wavelength MR emitters by expanding their material systems from fused polycyclic frameworks to non&#8208;fused conjugated polyene skeletons.

         <title>Cryogenic Carbon Monoxide Oxidation on Cuprous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconstructed Cu2O surface with pyramidal units (PY) contains both adsorption and reaction sites for CO oxidation. A suite of spectroscopy techniques and calculations were used to characterize the fundamental surface chemistry occurring below 100&#160;K, where typically a metal/oxide interface is required. This earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide shows that local surface ensembles of atoms can vary in reactivity.








Abstract
Performing oxidation reactions at low temperatures using earth&#8208;abundant materials is crucial for advancing solutions for sustainable chemistry. CO oxidation serves as a benchmark reaction to characterize oxidation and to advance fundamental concepts in surface chemistry. While there are several examples of CO oxidation occurring on metal oxides at low temperatures, from 300&#160;K to &#8764;200&#160;K, reactivity in the cryogenic temperature regime typically requires a metal nanoparticle on a metal oxide. Here, we show oxygen atoms on the (111) facet of Cu2O react with CO to form CO2 at temperatures below 100&#160;K. Combining spectroscopic experimental evidence with calculations, we propose a low barrier path for CO oxidation at reconstructed surface sites on Cu2O(111). This finding is a rare example of an earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide, in this case copper, that can provide highly reactive multifunctional sites, enabling both adsorption and reaction fundamental steps toward the efficient heterogeneous oxidation of chemicals.

         <title>NADH Mimic&#8208;Decorated Coordination Capsules for Biomimetic Capture of NO and Electrocatalytic Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimic decorated coordination capsule is reported, which encapsulates a glutathione analogue to echo the native S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione reductase for biomimetic NO capture and electroreduction to NH3. This is the first case of customizing an enzyme&#8208;like &#8220;capture&#8208;activation&#8208;conversion&#8221; pathway for biomimetic NO electroreduction, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten mechanism and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainable conversion of NO offers a promising technology for artificial nitrogen cycle, but faces challenges in integrating electrocatalysis with NO capture. Herein, a biomimetic NO capture&#8208;activation&#8208;conversion strategy was firstly formulated by encapsulating N&#8208;acetylcysteine (NAC) within a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimic&#8208;containing coordination capsule, enabling efficiently NH3 electrosynthesis. The installed NADH mimics onto the capsule interacted with the highly reactive NO&#8208;adduct generated from NAC within the microenvironment akin to the pocket of enzyme, facilitating intramolecular hydride transfer of the substrate&#8208;involving clathrate, accompanied by the formation of oxidated NAD+ mimics. Subsequently, the cobalt&#8208;based coordination capsule consecutively reserved e&#8722; from cathode while donating 2e&#8722; to the NAD+ mimic simultaneously for active cofactor recovered and recycle. This coordination capsule&#8208;mediated biomimetic system exhibited enzymatic kinetics following the Michaelis&#8211;Menten mechanism in the electrochemical NO reduction and realized almost 100% Faraday efficiency at potentials below &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a substantial NH3 yield rate of 121.6 &#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3 VRHE, ranking among the optimal electrocatalytic NO performance ever achieved, offering an attractive avenue toward renewable electricity&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation exploiting bioinspired artificial catalyst.

         <title>Reaction of Blatter and Verdazyl Radicals with Arynes: Synthesis and Investigation of N&#8208;Chiral, Antiaromatic Triazines, and Tetrazinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study a novel radical annulation reaction mode of Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes is demonstrated which offers access to antiaromatic and N&#8208;chiral triazines and tetrazinones. The photophysical and electrochemical properties are investigated revealing their potential for application in materials science.








Abstract
Arynes are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. In contrast to their extensively examined ionic reactivity, radical reactions with arynes remain scarcely explored. In this study, we present a novel radical annulation reaction of stable Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes, which offers access to polycyclic triazines and tetrazinones. The N2&#8208; and N4&#8208;annulated triazines derived from Blatter radicals exhibit distinct bending modes of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron triazine ring, yet retain a certain degree of antiaromaticity despite their nonplanar geometries, as revealed by NICS and ACID calculations. Notably, the N2&#8208;annulated triazines feature a strongly pyramidalized nitrogen atom with N&#8208;chirality. Optical resolution yielded pure enantiomers, from which the configurational stability was assessed to determine the N&#8208;inversion barrier.

&lt;p&gt;In this study a novel radical annulation reaction mode of Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes is demonstrated which offers access to antiaromatic and N-chiral triazines and tetrazinones. The photophysical and electrochemical properties are investigated revealing their potential for application in materials science.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arynes are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. In contrast to their extensively examined ionic reactivity, radical reactions with arynes remain scarcely explored. In this study, we present a novel radical annulation reaction of stable Blatter and verdazyl radicals with arynes, which offers access to polycyclic triazines and tetrazinones. The N2- and N4-annulated triazines derived from Blatter radicals exhibit distinct bending modes of the 8&#960;-electron triazine ring, yet retain a certain degree of antiaromaticity despite their nonplanar geometries, as revealed by NICS and ACID calculations. Notably, the N2-annulated triazines feature a strongly pyramidalized nitrogen atom with N-chirality. Optical resolution yielded pure enantiomers, from which the configurational stability was assessed to determine the N-inversion barrier. Furthermore, one of the N2-annulated triazine derivatives displayed intense fluorescence, highlighting its potential as a scaffold for light-emitting materials, whereas H-cell cycling studies of the N4-annulated triazine derivatives demonstrated long-term stability of the redox process underscoring their utility for battery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanospheres for Photothermal&#8208;Controlled Intracellular Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable DNA nanosphere platform combines tumor&#8208;targeting aptamers, GSH&#8208;responsive disassembly, and photothermal activation to enable spatiotemporally controlled intracellular protein degradation, adaptable to diverse targets and achieving potent synergistic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photothermal&#8208;controlled protein degradation has recently emerged as a promising ubiquitin proteasome&#8208;independent strategy for intracellular protein elimination by inducing localized heating to destroy target protein structures. However, current photothermal systems often suffer from low bioavailability and nonspecific distribution, which severely limit their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a programmable, photothermal&#8208;responsive DNA nanosphere (NS) for targeted and spatiotemporally controlled intracellular protein degradation. The modular NS integrates a tumor&#8208;targeting aptamer, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive disulfide linker, and a degradation unit composed of a photosensitizer and a protein&#8208;binding aptamer. After selective accumulation in tumor cells, the NS disassembles in the GSH&#8208;rich cytoplasm, releasing degradation modules that bind target proteins. Subsequent laser irradiation induces localized heating to disrupt protein conformation and activate autophagy&#8211;lysosomal clearance. This strategy enabled efficient programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) degradation across multiple cancer cell models and demonstrated adaptability to other targets such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby achieving synergistic antitumor effects with mild phototherapy. With improved tumor selectivity, cellular permeability, in vivo stability, and a highly modular design, this platform offers a multifunctional and translatable solution for intracellular protein degradation&#8211;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Homogeneous SnF2&#8208;Induced Strain Modulation in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise additive regulation strategy using phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) enables uniform distribution of SnF2 at grain boundaries via hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance. This suppresses SnF2 phase segregation, promotes homogeneous Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite crystallization, and effectively releases lattice strain, resulting in efficient and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Tin fluoride (SnF2) serves as an indispensable antioxidant in Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells, playing a critical role in the development of efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem architectures. However, excessive SnF2 often suffers from aggregation challenges, inevitably causing phase separation and tensile strain within the perovskite films, severely compromising device efficiency and stability. In this study, we report a precise regulation strategy by employing phenylethylammonium chloride (PEACl) to modulate the distribution of excess SnF2. The hydrogen bonding between PEACl and SnF2, coupled with steric hindrance effects, enables uniform dispersion of SnF2 at grain boundaries, effectively suppressing SnF2 phase segregation and promoting homogeneous crystallization of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. Moreover, it is revealed that the precise regulation of SnF2 distribution through PEACl effectively releases local strain in perovskite thin films. Single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb devices treated with the SnF2+PEACl demonstrate an exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.52%, substantially outperforming control devices at 20.83%. The optimized two&#8208;terminal (2&#8208;T) monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a remarkable PCE of 28.89%. Notably, these tandem devices maintain over 80% of their initial efficiency after continuous operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination for 670&#160;h, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Domain&#8208;Trained Language Model for Inverse Design and Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Storage MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domain&#8208;specific language model (MOFs&#8208;LLM), trained on over 6&#160;000 MOF&#8208;related publications and 15&#160;000 structures, enables inverse design of synthetically accessible hydrogen storage MOFs. Integrating chemical knowledge and structural reasoning, MOFs&#8208;LLM identifies top&#8208;performing candidates and guides the successful synthesis of Cu&#8208;LLMs&#8208;1, achieving 1.33&#160;wt% H2 uptake at 25&#176;C.








Abstract
A domain&#8208;specific large language model, MOFs&#8208;LLM, is developed to accelerate the inverse design and synthesis of metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) for hydrogen storage. Trained on 210 million tokens derived from over 6&#160;000 MOF&#8208;related publications and 15&#160;000 crystal structures, the model integrates chemical knowledge with structural features to improve structure&#8211;property reasoning. Compared to baseline methods, MOFs&#8208;LLM achieves a 46.7% enhancement in capturing structure&#8211;property relationships. It enables the inverse design of 60 candidate frameworks optimized for both hydrogen storage performance and synthetic accessibility. Guided by the model, a novel MOF (Cu&#8208;LLMs&#8208;1) was synthesized in three experimental iterations, exhibiting a hydrogen uptake of 1.33&#160;wt% at room temperature, ranking among the top five pure MOFs under comparable conditions. These findings highlight the potential of domain&#8208;trained language models to bridge virtual screening and experimental realization in materials discovery.

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Iron&#8208;Polyphthalocyanines with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalyst of H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne@iron&#8208;polyphthalocyanine (HsGDY@FePPc) is demonstrated for managing the NO3&#8722; to NH2OH process by engineering the coordination environment of the open Fe&#8208;N4 sites of FePPc with the diacetylene linkages of HsGDY. The diacetylene linkages work as transfer stations of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas the isolated Fe&#8208;N4 sites help to manage NO2&#8722; to NH2OH.








Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can be generated by controlling the nitrate electroreduction process, the key of which lies in the hydrogenation of *NO. In this study, hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) is developed to engineer the growth of iron&#8208;polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with four Fe&#8208;N4 centers around the diacetylene linkages via d&#8211;&#960; interactions, where numerous isolated electrochemical interfaces with high degrees of site exposure are achieved. Density functional theory results indicate electron transfer from Fe&#8208;N4 sites to diacetylene linkages, which prevents the hydrogenation of *NH2OH. In such a hybrid, a relay process occurs between HsGDY and FePPc, where the diacetylene linkages work as the transfer stations of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas the isolated Fe&#8208;N4 sites further help manage NO2&#8722; to NH2OH. In addition, the well&#8208;aligned nanoarrays along with the extended conjugated structure of HsGDY make it effective in directing both electron and mass transfer around FePPc. Thus, HsGDY@FePPc achieves a NH2OH yield rate of 52.3 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradic efficiency (FE) of 34.0% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.7 V vs RHE. When further applied in the electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, a FE of 51.0% is achieved. This work reports a coordination method for engineering both the structure and performance of a molecular catalyst via the diacetylene linkages of HsGDY.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the isolated Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites help to manage NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroxylamine (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) can be generated by controlling the nitrate electroreduction process, the key of which lies in the hydrogenation of *NO. In this study, hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) is developed to engineer the growth of iron-polyphthalocyanine (FePPc) with four Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; centers around the diacetylene linkages via d&#8211;&#960; interactions, where numerous isolated electrochemical interfaces with high degrees of site exposure are achieved. Density functional theory results indicate electron transfer from Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites to diacetylene linkages, which prevents the hydrogenation of *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. In such a hybrid, a relay process occurs between HsGDY and FePPc, where the diacetylene linkages work as the transfer stations of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the isolated Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites further help manage NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. In addition, the well-aligned nanoarrays along with the extended conjugated structure of HsGDY make it effective in directing both electron and mass transfer around FePPc. Thus, HsGDY@FePPc achieves a NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH yield rate of 52.3 &#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradic efficiency (FE) of 34.0% at&#160;&#8722;&#160;0.7 V vs RHE. When further applied in the electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime, a FE of 51.0% is achieved. This work reports a coordination method for engineering both the structure and performance of a molecular catalyst via the diacetylene linkages of HsGDY.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through Stronger Hindrance to Higher Reactivity: Influence of the Alkyl Chains on the Activation Energy of Ether Cleavage on Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For ether cleavage on Si(001), steric hindrance by the side chains was shown to determine the reactivity on the surface. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state.








Abstract
Reactivity in surface chemistry is often discussed in terms of the interaction between surface states and the functional groups of the reacting molecule. Herein, we demonstrate that for finite submonolayer coverage, i.e., surface coverage at which the molecular adsorbates cannot be treated as isolated molecules anymore, the seemingly innocent side chains of the adsorbate can also play a decisive role. For the example of ether cleavage on Si(001), which represents the surface analogue of an SN${\rm S}_{\rm N}$2&#8208;type reaction, we show both experimentally and based on ab initio calculations that steric hindrance by the side chains determines the activation energy for C&#8208;O dissociation into the final state. In contrast to a simple expectation, the stronger steric hindrance of the butyl group in butyl methyl ether leads to a lower activation energy for ether cleavage on Si(001) when compared to diethyl ether. This effect was traced back to different degrees of destabilization of the precursor and the transition state. Given the fact that for almost all technologically relevant processes the surface coverage is typically above the isolated&#8208;molecule limit, our findings are of general importance for surface functionalization and can help to properly design future&#160;experiments.

         <title>A Cathepsin B&#8208;Triggered CO&#8208;Releasing Molecule with a Non&#8208;Toxic Metal Core for Targeted Tumor Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based, enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) is site&#8208;specifically conjugated to the antibody trastuzumab. This novel ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;antibody conjugate releases carbon monoxide upon cleavage by the tumor&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B. The construct enables selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells, presenting a new strategy for targeted, CO&#8208;based cancer therapies.








Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) has shown therapeutic potential across various diseases, including cancer. To enable controlled delivery, many CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have been developed. However, their clinical translation has been limited due to concerns about stability, potential toxicity, and insufficient targeting ability. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of an enzyme&#8208;triggered CO&#8208;releasing molecule (ET&#8208;CORM) that can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to antibodies. This novel ET&#8208;CORM is built on a biocompatible iron core, and releases CO upon cleavage by the cancer&#8208;associated protease cathepsin B (CatB). The incorporation of a bioorthogonal handle into ET&#8208;CORM enabled its efficient and site&#8208;specific conjugation to the clinically used antibody trastuzumab us of the interchain disulfide bonds. The resulting ET&#8208;CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate (ET&#8208;CORM&#8208;Ab) exhibited an average drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) of 6.8, corresponding to approximately 20 CO molecules per conjugate. This construct allowed for selective intracellular CO delivery to HER2&#8208;overexpressing and CatB&#8208;expressing cells in vitro. This study represents a metal&#8208;based CORM&#8211;antibody conjugate activated by a tumor&#8208;associated enzymatic trigger, opening new avenues for investigating CO&#8208;mediated effects and advancing CO&#8208;based cancer therapies to the clinics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Formation of Ultrathin Conjugated Coordination Frameworks with Homogeneous Edge Effect Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Co&#8208;DABDT, a d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination framework (c&#8208;MCFs), as a model catalyst, the homogenic edge effect was regulated by the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment. Reduced layer plate thickness enables homogeneous edge curvatures to optimize interface charge/electric field distribution and strengthen oxidation intermediate adsorption, achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity.








Abstract
The d&#8211;&#960; conjugated conductive metal coordination frameworks (c&#8208;MCFs) are a type of emerging crystalline porous material. However, due to the interlayer conjugation effect, the clusters tend to assemble into 3D architectures, making it difficult to directly prepare ultrathin 2D structures. Herein, by reasonably regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and solvation layer of the reaction solvent environment, the interlayer conjugation effect of the Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT&#160;=&#160;2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) layer was effectively inhibited, and ultrathin c&#8208;MCFs were efficiently constructed. Using it as a suitable model catalyst, the solvent environment was optimized, and Co&#8208;DABDT with different homogenic edge curvatures was synthesized, including bulk Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;B), layered Co&#8208;DABDT (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;L), and Co&#8208;DABDT nanosheet (Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS). Among these, Co&#8208;DABDT&#8208;NS has the highest homogenic edge curvatures, with the optimal onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.97 and 0.82&#160;VRHE, respectively. Experimental and theoretical results show that as the layer plate thickness decreases, the homogenic edge curvatures can optimize the interface charge and electric field distribution and enhance the adsorption of oxidation intermediates, thereby achieving efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity. The results indicate that the role of this morphology&#8208;induced local field enhances the ORR kinetics and provides a new perspective for the study of catalyst morphology&#8208;field effect&#8208;catalytic kinetics.

         <title>Electrostatic and Geometric Regulation of &#8220;Third Terminal&#8221; in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural characteristics of INIC, we first proposed to establish the &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of NFAs by regulating delicate electrostatic and geometric of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC) at backbone centers, aiming to improving charge transfer/transport in OSCs. As a consequence, the OSC based on CH56 binary device achieves a surprising VOC &gt;1&#160;V and ternary device displays an excellent efficiency of 20.16%.








Abstract
Inspired by the dominant role of 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroinden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene) malononitrile (INCN) terminal in regulating molecular packing, an innovative strategy to construct &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed by introducing INIC&#8208;mimicking motifs to molecular backbone center. Through delicate electrostatic and geometric regulation of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC), newly designed NFAs (CH56, CH57, and CH58) render not only an inverted distribution of molecular frontier orbitals, but also the substantial HOMO&#8211;LUMO overlap for CH56 while pronounced spatial separation for others. Especially, the puckered TCNC with the most LUMOs distribution yet minimal involvement in molecular packings drives CH58 to adopt a pseudo&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (3D) packing network and inferior electron migration in sharp contrast to CH56. Moreover, the twisty CH57 and CH58 also exhibit unexpectedly quenched fluorescence due to the severe skeletal vibrations DCNQ and TCNC, further resulting in the large energy losses and poor photovoltaic performance. Finally, CH56&#8208;based OSCs yield a surprising open&#8208;circuit&#8208;voltage of 1.007&#160;V for binary devices and an excellent 20.16% efficiency for ternary devices. Our trials on &#8220;third terminal&#8221; has enabled the extensive exploration of novel architectures of NFAs beyond conventional structural paradigms.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the dominant role of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (INCN) terminal in regulating molecular packing, an innovative strategy to construct &#8220;third terminals&#8221; of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed by introducing INIC-mimicking motifs to molecular backbone center. Through delicate electrostatic and geometric regulation of INCN analogues (NQ, DCNQ, and TCNC), newly designed NFAs (CH56, CH57, and CH58) render not only an inverted distribution of molecular frontier orbitals, but also the substantial HOMO&#8211;LUMO overlap for CH56 while pronounced spatial separation for others. Especially, the puckered TCNC with the most LUMOs distribution yet minimal involvement in molecular packings drives CH58 to adopt a pseudo-three-dimensional (3D) packing network and inferior electron migration in sharp contrast to CH56. Moreover, the twisty CH57 and CH58 also exhibit unexpectedly quenched fluorescence due to the severe skeletal vibrations DCNQ and TCNC, further resulting in the large energy losses and poor photovoltaic performance. Finally, CH56-based OSCs yield a surprising open-circuit-voltage of 1.007&#160;V for binary devices and an excellent 20.16% efficiency for ternary devices. Our trials on &#8220;third terminal&#8221; has enabled the extensive exploration of novel architectures of NFAs beyond conventional structural paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag Interface to Decouple Reactant Activation for Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Ester Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces on Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 decouple the activation of H2 and ester substrates in dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation. Electron transfer generates electron&#8208;rich Ag sites for facile H2 dissociation and adjacent electron&#8208;deficient NiOx sites for preferential DMO adsorption, mitigating competitive adsorption. This cooperative architecture enables rapid H2 spillover, timely desorption of methyl glycolate, and exceptional stability, highlighting interfacial inversion as a versatile catalytic design paradigm.








Abstract
Achieving simultaneous high activity, selectivity, and stability in ester hydrogenation remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the competitive adsorption of reactants at active sites. Here, we introduce an inverse NiOx&#8208;Ag interface as a general design platform to spatially decouple the activation of H2 and ester, exemplified with dimethyl oxalate (DMO). The catalyst (Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2), synthesized via controlled partial reduction of Ni phyllosilicate followed by Ag deposition, features electron&#8208;rich Ag sites and electron&#8208;deficient interfacial Ni sites arising from interfacial electron transfer. Comprehensive characterizations reveal abundant NiOx&#8208;Ag interfaces with modified coordination and electronic structures. In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption/surface reaction, and H2&#8208;D2 isotope exchange experiments demonstrate that H2 is preferentially dissociated at Ag sites, while DMO adsorbs and activates on NiOx sites, effectively mitigating competitive adsorption. Theoretical calculations confirm the cooperative nature of the interface, showing low barriers for H2 dissociation and favorable desorption energetics for methyl glycolate (MG), suppressing over&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the Ag&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalyst delivers a turnover frequency of 944.4 h&#8722;1 with &#8764;99% selectivity to MG over 500&#160;h of continuous operation, among the highest reported for DMO hydrogenation. This work establishes interfacial inversion engineering as a versatile approach to optimize site complementarity in multi&#8208;step catalytic transformations.

         <title>Aquatic Environment Breaks the Size Confinement of the TiO2 Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 exhibits an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 particles. This novel aqueous interface regulation enhances the surface energy of submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 anode, thereby increasing their robustness in aqueous battery systems. The submicron TiO2 can be scaled up into an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. The pouch cell can achieve a high energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) with superior electrochemical performance of 1200 cycles.








Abstract
The particle size of TiO2 anodes is commonly believed to have a negative impact on their mechanical properties. As submicron&#8208;sized TiO2 exhibits low surface energy, which reduces yield strength and leads to mechanical fracture during the two&#8208;phase lithium storage mechanism, it is excluded from traditional nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, we discovered that TiO2 demonstrates an independent size effect in an aqueous environment, mitigating the mechanical fracture associated with submicron&#8208;sized TiO2. Our studies reveal that water molecules strongly interact with submicron TiO2 materials, increasing the surface energy in aqueous electrolytes in a unique manner. This enhancement makes submicron TiO2 more resilient during the lithiation and de&#8208;lithiation reactions. Additionally, the transition from nano to submicron TiO2 facilitates the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in aqueous batteries and enhances the performance of electrode coatings. Consequently, submicron TiO2 exhibits superior electrochemical performance in aqueous batteries, with an Ah&#8208;level pouch battery achieving an energy density of 66&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (217&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) and demonstrating excellent cycling stability of over 1200 cycles. Our work has successfully addressed the size limitations of the TiO2 anodes, offering an innovative perspective on micro&#8208;sized electrode materials previously considered unsuitable for battery use.

In their Research Article (e202515805), Ye Wang et&#160;al. report the controllable synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy, &lt; 2 nm) via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy enhances the atom utilization of Pd and modulates its geometric structure. The sub&#8208;2 nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

         <title>High Performance Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Battery Electrolytes Regulation Mechanism: A Review</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulatory mechanism of sulfur&#8208;based solid electrolytes was reviewed in detail. Based on the problems of thermodynamic and kinetic instability and failure that exist, the mechanism of the regulation strategy was explored from aspects such as the soft&#8211;hard&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and the glass structure theory. It provides an important reference for the future development of sulfur&#8208;based SEs with both air stability, high ionic conductivity, and good contact performance.








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) exhibit excellent ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties, but their poor air stability and solid&#8211;solid contact performance seriously hinder the wide application of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Herein, this paper reviews the history and the major breakthroughs in the development of sulfide SEs. The theories of hard&#8211;soft&#8208;acid&#8211;base theory and glass structure theory, as well as several strategies to improve the chemical stability of sulfide SEs, are discussed emphatically. In addition, this paper also explores its thermal runaway mechanism and reaction mechanism from the aspects of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, providing a reference for the research on improving stability and electrical conductivity. Finally, we summarized the challenges that still need to be addressed at present, as well as the research directions and prospects of sulfide SEs for ASSBs in the future.

This review systematically compares structural and electronic properties of three iron porphyrin carbene isomers&#8212;terminal, bridged, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;across enzymatic and synthetic systems. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals protein&#8208;induced adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, while M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies elucidate ground&#8208;state electronic configurations and spin transitions. Critical connections between synthetic models and engineered proteins are established, advancing mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer catalysis. 








Abstract
Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs), pivotal intermediates in enzymatic carbene transfer reactions, adopt diverse bonding modes and electronic configurations that govern their catalytic functions. This review systematically compares three IPC isomers&#8212;terminal carbenes, bridged carbenes, and N&#8208;alkyl derivatives&#8212;isolated from enzymatic systems with synthetic analogues. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, which reveals protein&#8208;induced structural adaptations and isomer&#8208;specific distortions, also facilitates M&#246;ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies.

&lt;p&gt;This review systematically compares structural and electronic properties of three iron porphyrin carbene isomers&#8212;terminal, bridged, and N-alkyl derivatives&#8212;across enzymatic and synthetic systems. X-ray crystallography reveals protein-induced adaptations and isomer-specific distortions, while M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies elucidate ground-state electronic configurations and spin transitions. Critical connections between synthetic models and engineered proteins are established, advancing mechanistic understanding of carbene transfer catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron porphyrin carbenes (IPCs), pivotal intermediates in enzymatic carbene transfer reactions, adopt diverse bonding modes and electronic configurations that govern their catalytic functions. This review systematically compares three IPC isomers&#8212;terminal carbenes, bridged carbenes, and N-alkyl derivatives&#8212;isolated from enzymatic systems with synthetic analogues. X-ray crystal structure analysis, which reveals protein-induced structural adaptations and isomer-specific distortions, also facilitates M&#246;ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies.

         <title>Development and Application of Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereochemical Epimerization in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;mediated stereochemical epimerization enables direct stereochemical editing at inert C&#9472;H sites and late&#8208;stage modifications of complex molecules. By controlling hydrogen atom transfer through abstraction and donation, and bond cleavage and reformation, researchers have achieved site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization at challenging positions, including unactivated tertiary carbons and sterically hindered quaternary carbon stereocenters. This strategy facilitates the total synthesis of natural products.









Abstract
Precise control over stereochemistry (enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity) is essential in the long&#8208;step synthetic protocol of complex molecules bearing multiple stereocenters, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals. Stereospecificity is the ideal goal for the formation of the first and subsequent chiral centers in the specific chemical environment through either an exo&#8208; or endo&#8208;genous molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. In this context, epimerization and isomerization offer valuable supplemental strategies for modifying preexisting stereocenters, thereby enhancing synthetic efficiency, enabling molecular diversification, and facilitating late&#8208;stage modification. Recent advances in radical&#8208;mediated epimerization have further enabled site&#8208;specific inversion of stereocenters, allowing late&#8208;stage access to diverse stereoisomers from a common intermediate. This minireview highlights emerging approaches in radical&#8208;based stereochemical epimerization and discusses their potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules, emphasizing their role as a complementary strategy to previously established epimerization tactics. Also covered are recent developments in the epimerization of quaternary carbon stereocenters, an underexplored yet promising area that offers new opportunities for innovation in synthetic design.

         <title>Fully&#8208;Functionalized Natural Product Probes to Expand the Chemical Tractability of the Human Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit the inherent structural complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a unique library of photoaffinity (PA) probes, which we term fully functionalized natural products (FFNPs). Using mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemical proteomics, we uncover hundreds of topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective interactions with functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes in live cells. This work supports the potential of FFNPs to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.








Abstract
Photoaffinity (PA)&#8208;based chemoproteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means for proteome&#8208;wide mapping of ligandable proteins directly in cells, as well as the concatenated discovery of small molecule chemical probes. However, due to the relatively low throughput of screening small molecule libraries by proteomics and the synthetic burden incurred in installing the requisite photoactivatable functionality on each member, great priority must be placed on library design to maximize efficient exploration of biologically relevant chemical space and to ensure the identification of authentic binding interactions. To address this challenge, here we leverage the inherent complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a structurally unique series of diastereo/regioisomeric PA probes for ligand discovery in cells. Through semi&#8208;synthesis, we exploit sp3&#8208;rich NP scaffolds and employ mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomics to identify and quantify their interactions in human cells, uncovering topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective ligands for functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of NP&#8208;inspired chemoproteomic libraries to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.

A dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DddK) was identified as an efficient aza&#8208;Michaelase for the addition of amines to acrylate. Screening 74 amines with wild&#8208;type DddK and its W26G variant yielded N&#8208;substituted and N,N&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;&#8208;amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza&#8208;Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza&#8208;Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza&#8208;Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 (DddKPu). In vivo DddKPu catalyzes the &#946;&#8208;elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa&#8208;Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddKPu against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild&#8208;type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of N,N&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddKPu as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.

         <title>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Reaction of Non&#8208;Activated Oximes Catalyzed by Aldoxime Dehydratases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalytic mode of aldoxime dehydratases for the abiotic radical ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic ketoximes is reported. Aldoxime dehydratase from Nocardioides simplex was found to efficiently generate iminyl radicals from challenging &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; cycloketone oximes and to promote radical ring&#8208;opening reactions to produce &#947;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;sulfinylated nitriles under mild conditions. 








Abstract
The iminyl radical is a distinctive N&#8208;centered radical which serves as a versatile synthon in preparation of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. In principle, iminyl radicals can be directly generated by single electron reduction of oximes through elimination of OH group. However, due to the low reactivity of the oxime N&#9472;OH bonds, direct conversion of the oximes does not proceed efficiently, thereby enforcing chemical activation of the oxime OH group which results in the formation of stoichiometric by&#8208;products. To overcome this problem, we are developing a new biocatalytic system using aldoxime dehydratases. Through a series of enzyme screenings, we identified an aldoxime dehydratase from N. simplex (NsOxd) which is capable of catalyzing iminyl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening reactions. Notably, NsOxd efficiently converts the &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; 2&#8208;phenylcyclobutanone oxime within 10&#160;min under ambient conditions and quantitatively produces the corresponding &#947;&#8208;sulfinylated nitrile in &gt;95% yield. This enzyme activity is even faster than that of previously&#8208;reported chemo&#8208;catalysts. Furthermore, evaluation of the scope of potential substrates indicates that NsOxd has a versatile N&#9472;O bond cleaving activity which efficiently generates iminyl radicals from various &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes. These findings highlight the utility of aldoxime dehydratases for managing the reactivity of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; oximes and for achieving challenging iminyl radical&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions.

         <title>Truxenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework/Carbon Nanotube Composite for High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode exhibits excellent sodium storage performance at low temperature with high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries face great challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics. Redox covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with porous structures provide a viable solution to accelerate the ionic diffusion and reaction kinetics at low temperatures. However, the applications of COFs in low&#8208;temperature batteries are still at their infancy stage. Here, a composite electrode containing truxenone&#8208;based COF and a small amount of CNTs is reported for low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The truxenone&#8208;based COF possesses high ratio of active centers and enables high theoretical capacity; while the CNTs guarantee the accessibility of the active sites, the charge transfer efficiency, and the fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the composite electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 365 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 (295 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution). Notably, it offers excellent low&#8208;temperature performance that maintains a high discharge capacity of 263.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (203 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) at 0 &#176;C, which represents 74% of the capacity at room temperature. Even under extreme weather of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the capacity maintains 156.8 mAh g&#8722;1 (119 mAh g&#8722;1 after subtracting carbon contribution) after 100 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 97%. This work illustrates the synergistic effect of the fast ionic diffusion of truxenone&#8208;based COF and the excellent charge transfer of the CNTs, offering a feasible way to realize low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Tellurium&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Support Boosting Platinum Catalysis in High&#8208;Efficiency Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) and nitrogen (N) heteroatoms were introduced into graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC) to support small Pt nanoparticles (average size of 3.2&#160;nm) with uniform high loading (40 wt%), yielding the Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC catalyst. Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediated electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt enhanced high&#8208;voltage stability and the catalytic activity of Pt, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC.








Abstract
Enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells necessitates optimization of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under high&#8208;voltage conditions through improved Pt catalysis. This study introduces an electrocatalyst that uniformly anchors a high loading (40 wt%) of small Pt nanoparticles (3.2&#160;nm) on a novel support: tellurium and nitrogen co&#8208;mediated graphitized mesoporous carbon (Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC). The strong metal&#8211;support interactions arise from Pt&#9472;Te and Pt&#9472;N bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that Te&#8211;N co&#8208;mediation enhances the high&#8208;voltage oxidation resistance of Pt via electron reverse transfer from the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support to Pt. Consequently, the Pt valence state in Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC increases by only +0.085 from open&#8208;circuit potential to 1.5&#160;V, resulting in exceptional durability over 100&#160;000 high&#8208;voltage cycles (1&#8211;1.5&#160;V) with negligible morphological aggregation. Moreover, the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, enabling Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC to achieve outstanding activity (0.7&#160;V at 1.26 A cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;air conditions). This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high&#8208;voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high&#8208;efficiency fuel cells.

Consequently, the Pt valence state in Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC increases by only +0.085 from open-circuit potential to 1.5&#160;V, resulting in exceptional durability over 100&#160;000 high-voltage cycles (1&#8211;1.5&#160;V) with negligible morphological aggregation. Moreover, the Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC support effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, enabling Pt/Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC to achieve outstanding activity (0.7&#160;V at 1.26 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;air conditions). This translates to an 18.6% increase in electrical efficiency compared with commercial Pt/C at the same output power density. These findings demonstrate the potential of Te&#8211;N&#8211;GMC as a robust cocatalyst for high-voltage ORR and highlight a promising strategy for enhancing Pt catalysis for high-efficiency fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Multistate Mechanoresistance in a Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Incorporating Energy&#8208;Dissipative Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded sacrificial unit exhibits enhanced mechanoresistive behavior. The sacrificial conformational transition can be achieved through the regulation of intramolecular dispersion forces, while realizing multiple stable electrical signals as the junction is compressed and stretched, laying the foundation for constructing multimodal mechanical molecular switches at the molecular level.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive molecular devices are capable of exhibiting dynamic responses to external mechanical stimuli, enabling applications in smart materials, nano&#8208;devices, and flexible electronics. However, energy conversion induced by mechanical stimuli requires efficient energy dissipation mechanisms. Traditional methods often involve bond breaking or incomplete energy release, which can lead to device failure during continuous operations. Therefore, ensuring the mechanical stability of molecular devices under cyclic external forces remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a pillar[6]arene&#8208;like cyclophane (PLC) as an energy&#8208;dissipative structure to construct a programmable multistate mechanoswitching at the single&#8208;molecule level. We observed that, compared to rigid molecules with low energy dissipation, PLC&#8208;based macrocyclic molecular devices not only withstand mechanical stretching up to 6&#160;&#197; but also exhibit three stable states during the mechanical stretching/compressing processes. Combined with theoretical calculations, we confirm that these three distinct states are related to the charge transport pathways and the strength of the electrode&#8208;molecule interface coupling. This work establishes energy dissipation as a core design principle for multistate mechanoelectronic devices.

         <title>Control of Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Reactivity by Rotaxanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been achieved by rotaxanation. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield and they displayed a much slower kinetics compared to the corresponding thread. Mechanical bond disassembly upon the right stimulus activates reactivity. Indeed, IEDDA could be selectively activated inside senescent surrogate cells by a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive rotaxane.








Abstract
Rotaxanation is an efficient method to control the tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield by crown ether active template applied to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines. Kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazine rotaxanes were much slower than those with the corresponding threads. Interestingly, disassembly of the mechanical bond upon the application of the right stimulus activates IEDDA. Control of IEDDA in live cells was proved by means of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase sensitive tetrazine rotaxane: Enzymatic digestion allowed the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, which resulted in a fluorescent compound.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Cost Lacunary Metal&#8208;Oxo Framework Enables Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

A novel inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework, BSiW9, serves as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs, resulting in not only a remarkable PCE but also outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture usually exhibit decent efficiency due to the easily tunable energy levels of organic interfacial layers (ILs). However, their operational lifetime is limited by the morphological instability of organic ILs especially the electron&#8208;transporting layer (ETL) that shows strong self&#8208;aggregation tendency. Besides, organic ETLs are confronted with significant challenges including large batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations and high costs. Herein, we develop an inorganic lacunary&#8208;structure metal&#8208;oxo framework as ETL of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. The resultant molecule, BSiW9, not only shows ultralow cost but also leads to significantly enhanced electron extraction in OSCs. Moreover, the redox activity of BSiW9 allows reinforced electrical conductivity by using a hydroquinone&#8208;derivative dopant, HQ. The doping strategy finally results in a remarkable PCE of 20.5% in p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSC, largely outperforming that using organic ETLs. Meanwhile, an outstanding long&#8208;term stability is obtained in this champion device, with 92% of original efficiency maintained after a maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking for 1250&#160;h, among the longest lifetimes of p&#8208;i&#8208;n OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing rationally tailored low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;oxo framework as ILs for more industrially compatible OSCs.

         <title>Regioselective Zr5 Nanocluster Photocatalyst for Precise Protein Editing Under Mild Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster serves as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for regioselective oxidative cleavage and side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme protein. Upon UV irradiation, it generates reactive oxygens species (ROS), with reaction selectivity guided by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the cluster's positively charged surface and electrostatically negatively charged regions on the protein near the cleavage sites.








Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modifications on protein structure and function is of central importance in protein chemistry, necessitating precise and controlled methods for introducing such modifications. Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr5&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst.

Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr5&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle&#8208;down proteomics applications.

Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr5&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 20&#8208;nm&#8208;Thick ZIF&#8208;67 Films for Hydrogen Sieving Using &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 Precursor Nanosheets</title>

We report that highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets (&#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) could be synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction of ultradilute precursors (Co(NO3)2 + 2&#8208;methyimidazole (HmIm) + H2O system) at room temperature in just 1 h. By using thin coatings of the as&#8208;synthesized &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as self&#8208;sacrificial templates, &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes could be fabricated in a facile way. The prepared ZIF&#8208;67 membranes demonstrated attractive H2 sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) is an important class of nanoporous materials for high&#8208;performance membranes for gas separation, offering uniform&#8208;sized gas&#8208;selective pores. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes, critical for high&#8208;performance separation, has remained elusive. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes. We identify a simple and rapid route to prepare &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor to ZIF&#8208;67. Highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction at room temperature in just 1 h using ultradilute cobalt and linker concentrations in water. The resulting high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets yield compact coating on porous polymeric supports. Well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;67 membranes are prepared by thermal treatment of nanosheets in the presence of a linker and exhibit attractive hydrogen sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C). This approach provides a scalable and versatile platform for hydrogen separation for applications such as precombustion carbon capture.

         <title>Organocatalytic Microfluidic Double&#8208;Layer Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highest expectations from catalysis with external electric fields, from organic synthesis to sustainable industrial production and the origin of life, cannot be explored because of&#160;the incompatibility with scalable bulk conditions. This challenge is addressed with bioinspired organocatalytic electrical double&#8208;layer architectures as supramolecular electrodes in microfluidic capacitors. The result is an enabling method for scalable electric&#8208;field catalysis.








Abstract
Ideas to use external electric fields to enable, accelerate and direct the movement of electrons during chemical reactions are not new. Theory and experiments under special conditions predict that electric&#8208;field catalysis (EFC) from externally applied fields could change the way we make molecules. The challenge is the incompatibility with organic synthesis under scalable bulk conditions. Access to applied electric fields (AEFs) &gt; 1&#160;V nm&#8722;1, predicted as necessary for direct transition&#8208;state stabilization, is not possible even with electromicrofluidic systems, where the distance between the plate electrodes is minimized. Therefore, we decided to shift our attention from the applied fields to their consequences. We consider electrical double layers (EDLs) that form within a few nanometers from the plate electrodes as engineerable supramolecular electrodes. Applying lessons from cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), we report supramolecular electrodes with effective electric fields (EEFs) that exceed applied fields by more than five million. According to a proline&#8208;catalyzed aldol condensation installed as benchmark reaction, those engineered from polyarginine and pyrenebutyrate are most active for EFC, exactly as in cellular uptake. With the best supramolecular electrodes, EFC triples the yield of one of the most optimized reactions in organocatalysis. New methods to access scalable EFC open up broad perspectives in organic synthesis and beyond.

         <title>Interfacial Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MIL&#8208;125@ZIF&#8208;8 catalyst, featuring asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfacial sites, enables photocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and N2. At the Zn sites, CO2 is reduced to *CO species, while N2 is activated at the Ti sites to form *NH&#8211;NH intermediates. The asymmetric Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interfaces facilitate the coupling of *CO with *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urea photosynthesis.








Abstract
Urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 has profound environmental and energy implications. However, the simultaneous activation of CO2 and N2, along with the promotion of C&#9472;N bond formation, remains a major challenge. Herein, the asymmetric interfacial sites (Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti) were engineered by building oxygen atom bridges between ZIF&#8208;8 and MIL&#8208;125 to enable efficient photocatalytic urea synthesis. The optimized Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Ti interface structure achieves a urea yield of 130&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water and an apparent quantum yield of 5.52% at 350&#160;nm, outperforming most materials reported for urea photosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that Zn sites catalyze the conversion of CO2 to *CO species, while Ti sites adsorb and activate N2 to generate *NH&#8211;NH species. The asymmetric interfacial sites lower the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NH&#8211;NH to form *CONH2 intermediates, thereby promoting urea photosynthesis. This work provides significant insights into designing interfacial asymmetric sites to facilitate photosynthetic organic chemicals for upgrading the nitrogen cycle.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers via Photoinduced Radical Copolymerization of Levoglucosenone and Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers was synthesized via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and commercially available vinyl ethers. The resulting polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, high glass transition temperatures (up to 212&#160;&#176;C), and efficient degradability. In addition, the sugar&#8208;based materials display exceptional adhesion strength, surpassing that of widely used commercial adhesives. Postpolymerization modifications further enabled access to fluorescent materials and grafted semiconducting polymers.








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a library of 17 sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers via photoinduced radical copolymerization of naturally occurring levoglucosenone (LGO) and a broad range of commercially available vinyl ethers. This strategy leverages renewable feedstocks and enables precise control over copolymer sequence, affording materials with excellent thermal stability, tunable glass transition temperature (Tg), and on&#8208;demand degradability. The resulting sugar&#8208;based materials exhibit superior adhesive strength compared to commercial benchmarks such as commercial polyurethane adhesive and ethylene&#8208;vinyl acetate (EVA). Postpolymerization modifications further facilitate the preparation of fluorescent materials and graft semiconducting polymers, expanding the functional versatility of these sugar&#8208;based alternating copolymers.

         <title>Interactional Features of (RO)4Ti Species and Their Zr and Hf Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational and experimental studies reveal that Group 4 tetroxides form a new type of &#963;&#8208;hole interaction with N and O nucleophiles, which we propose to name &#8220;titan bonds&#8221; (TnBs). These insights into Ti, Zr, and Hf interactions may aid in the rational design of more selective catalysts for aldol and oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Tetroxides of Group 4 elements are benchmark catalysts for aldol reactions and oxidation processes, achieving high yields and regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Our computational analyses and experimental studies, performed in solution and solid, consistently reveal that these tetroxides form attractive interactions with lone pair compounds exhibiting distinctive &#963;&#8208;hole bond features. We propose naming these novel bondings as titan bonds (TnBs). These new insights into Ti/Zr/Hf tetroxide interactions may significantly aid in designing more effective catalysts with enhanced selectivities.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Calyciphylline F</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic Daphniphyllum alkaloids was the Calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid, featuring a strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Presented herein is the total synthesis of calyciphylline F, a member of the calyciphylline D&#8208;type alkaloid family, by an intramolecular [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles, an intramolecular aldol reaction, and three C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming radical reactions.








Abstract
Calyciphylline F represents the final challenge in the total synthesis of the caged polycyclic&#8208;type of Daphniphyllum alkaloids due to the strained 8&#8208;azatricyclo[4.2.1.04,8]nonane ring system. Here, we report the total synthesis of calyciphylline F. We construct the ring system by applying [4&#160;+&#160;3] cycloaddition reaction of pyrroles with 2&#8208;oxyallyl cations to an intramolecular reaction, followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction and capture of the resulting alkoxide as the xanthate. The bridgehead quaternary carbon center is constructed by the intramolecular addition reaction of the bridgehead radical to the alkoxy&#8208;acrylate, which is designed based on the proposed mechanism of by&#8208;product formation. Finally, another 6&#8208;exo&#8208;radical cyclization reaction constructs the last remaining ring and achieves the total synthesis of calyciphylline F.

         <title>Probing and Enhancing DNA Ligase Specificity via Se&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mutagenesis of ATP for Accurate Gene Synthesis and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The O&#8208;to&#8208;Se&#8208;atom substitution enables the probing and study of mismatch discrimination at the atomic level, and the Se atom in ATP&#945;Se has been used to probe the key interactions and enhance DNA ligation specificity (up to 1000&#8208;fold) within an expanded region (8&#160;nt), allowing the more efficient gene synthesis (200&#8208;fold enhancement) and the more accurate single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection.








Abstract
Discriminating against base&#8208;pair mismatches by nucleic acid&#8208;related enzymes is essential for DNA replication, RNA replication, nucleic acid repair, transcription, and translation. However, the discrimination mechanisms at the atomic level remain poorly understood, limited by the availability of atom&#8208;probing methods. Herein, we developed a single&#8208;Se&#8208;atom strategy (using ATP&#945;Se) to explore mismatch discrimination in the DNA ligase system. We found that the Se&#8208;atom (substituting O) in ATP&#945;Se played a key role in the mismatch discrimination of DNA ligase, and ATP&#945;Se significantly improved the ligation specificity, achieving up to 1000&#8208;fold enhancement and expanding the region of mismatch discrimination up to 8&#160;nt. Sequencing ligation products of various substrates generally confirmed the specificity enhancement using ATP&#945;Se. Our mechanistic studies indicated that the specificity increase was correlated with the kcat reduction in mismatch ligations and with the disruption of the key interactions, supported by the site&#8208;specific ligase mutations. Further, using ATP&#945;Se, we achieved over 200&#8208;fold increase in gene assembly efficiency and accomplished mismatch suppression in the single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) detection. In conclusion, our Se&#8208;atom&#8208;probing strategy enables the atomic&#8208;level studies on mismatch discrimination and offers a useful tool for accuracy enhancement, highlighting its broad potential for exploring molecular recognition and specificity.

         <title>A Photothermal Nano&#8208;Switch for Tumor&#8208;Selective Wnt Hyperactivation in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) is presented for precise, spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis.








Abstract
Wnt signaling plays a paradoxical role in cancer, functioning as both a promoter and suppressor depending on its activation level. This duality underscores the critical need for precise and selective modulation, while existing Wnt&#8208;targeting strategies fail to achieve it due to inadequate specificity and control. Here, we report a photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) that enables spatiotemporal and selective activation of the Wnt pathway. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, localized heating disrupts Wif1&#8208;Wnt interactions, triggering controlled Wnt protein release. The liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis. In contrast, normal cells remain unaffected due to their lower basal Wnt activity, as confirmed by negligible cytotoxicity and unaltered apoptotic markers. In vivo, this system achieves robust antitumor effects in a 4T1 breast cancer model while ensuring safety for healthy tissues. By leveraging the optical properties of gold nanorods for conditional and selective activation, this study establishes a transformative platform for the precise modulation of Wnt signaling, offering significant promise for treating Wnt&#8208;dysregulated diseases with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Coordination Reconstruction Enhanced Synergistic Nonradical Oxidation Pathways in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustained Pollutant Destruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a coordination modification strategy, enabling O substitution of N in the first shell of cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts. The higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of Co&#8208;N2O2 over Co&#8208;N3O1 stems from more efficient generation and utilization of nonradical reactive oxygen species (e&#8722;, 1O2, HVMO). We achieved nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal in 10&#160;h dynamic membrane reaction and effective landfill leachate degradation.








Abstract
Limited synthetic efficiency and high costs constrain industrial production of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) despite their superior catalytic performance. We report a scalable and economical solid&#8208;state pyrolysis strategy for cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (Co&#8208;SACs) costing &#8764;$35&#160;kg&#8722;1. Hydrothermal O&#8208;substitution precisely engineers the coordination environment from Co&#8208;N3O1 to Co&#8208;N2O2. The upshifted d&#8208;band center and enhanced electron delocalization of Co&#8208;N2O2 decrease electron density at the Co site, strengthening peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance, probe experiments, and electrochemical tests synergistic confirmed that Co&#8208;N2O2 significantly promotes nonradical processes, including the generation of singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxo species, and electron transfer processes. The resultant Co&#8208;N2O2 catalyst achieved over 98% degradation of high&#8208;concentration sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) within 10&#160;min. The kilogram&#8208;scale Co&#8208;N2O2 (kg&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2) demonstrated outstanding efficiency in treating landfill leachate (2548&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 TOC removal) and preeminent stability in 14 cycles and 10&#160;h membrane dynamic experiments.

     alt="Coordination Reconstruction Enhanced Synergistic Nonradical Oxidation Pathways in Cobalt Single-Atom Catalysts for Sustained Pollutant Destruction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a coordination modification strategy, enabling O substitution of N in the first shell of cobalt single-atom catalysts. The higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of Co-N2O2 over Co-N3O1 stems from more efficient generation and utilization of nonradical reactive oxygen species (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HVMO). We achieved nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal in 10&#160;h dynamic membrane reaction and effective landfill leachate degradation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited synthetic efficiency and high costs constrain industrial production of single-atom catalysts (SACs) despite their superior catalytic performance. We report a scalable and economical solid-state pyrolysis strategy for cobalt single-atom catalysts (Co-SACs) costing &#8764;$35&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Hydrothermal O-substitution precisely engineers the coordination environment from Co-N3O1 to Co-N2O2. The upshifted d-band center and enhanced electron delocalization of Co-N2O2 decrease electron density at the Co site, strengthening peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance, probe experiments, and electrochemical tests synergistic confirmed that Co-N2O2 significantly promotes nonradical processes, including the generation of singlet oxygen, high-valent metal oxo species, and electron transfer processes. The resultant Co-N2O2 catalyst achieved over 98% degradation of high-concentration sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) within 10&#160;min. The kilogram-scale Co-N2O2 (kg-Co-N2O2) demonstrated outstanding efficiency in treating landfill leachate (2548&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; TOC removal) and preeminent stability in 14 cycles and 10&#160;h membrane dynamic experiments. This work provides both fundamental elucidation into coordination engineering and a practical solution for large-scale production of SACs in environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hot Electron Photocatalysis Using Nontoxic Self&#8208;Doped Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast Auger processes efficiently generate hot electrons in quantum dots (QDs), enabling photoreduction of aryl halides (up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus SCE) and diverse cross&#8208;coupling reactions (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S). Quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs demonstrate significantly higher reactivity than CuInS2 QDs, due to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This study highlights the potential of using Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons from nontoxic QDs for challenging organic transformations under mild conditions.








Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as versatile photocatalysts for organic transformations. However, a significant drawback is their reliance on toxic metals like lead and cadmium, which limits their widespread application in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Furthermore, current systems primarily utilize band&#8208;edge carriers for simpler photoredox reactions, while the potential for harvesting hot carriers in chemical transformations remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we developed nontoxic, cost&#8208;effective, and recyclable ternary CuInS2 and quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs as potent photocatalysts. Our findings demonstrate that hot electrons can be effectively generated through an ultrafast Auger process, enabling the photoreduction of aryl halides (with reduction potentials up to &#8722;2.90&#160;V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) and various cross&#8208;coupling (C&#9472;C, C&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;S) transformations. Notably, quaternary Cu&#9472;In&#9472;Zn&#9472;S QDs exhibit significantly higher reactivity compared to CuInS2 QDs, which is attributed to enhanced Auger&#8208;mediated hot electron generation. This work underscores the potential of directly utilizing Auger&#8208;generated hot electrons for extreme&#8208;potential organic transformations under mild conditions using nontoxic QDs.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions Modulate RNA:DNA Folding Observed via Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state nanopores enable the detection of RNA species at the single&#8208;molecule level. To rapidly and accurately identify barcoded RNAs as they translocate the pore, it is imperative to reduce analyte folding. Here, we demonstrate that RNA's supramolecular interactions with urea inhibit folding, increasing the number of readable barcodes while decreasing the number of events required for RNA identification. 








Abstract
DNA and RNA nanotechnology enables the precise assembly of molecular architectures, with applications in bioengineering, supramolecular chemistry, and sensing. The material properties of these biopolymers can be adjusted covalently or, more simply, through non&#8208;covalent interactions with small molecules. Herein, we demonstrate the use of urea, an abundant and inexpensive small molecule, to modulate the stiffness of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures. Our results suggest that supramolecular interactions between urea and the A&#8208;form&#8208;like helix rigidify the hybrid polymers, as evidenced by both solid&#8208;state nanopore measurements and atomic force microscopy. Nanopore sensing reveals that preparing topologically&#8208;barcoded RNA:DNA hybrids in urea results in a 50% reduction in folded translocations. This decrease in folded events improves the proportion of useable data points, paving the way for the robust detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA analytes at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation and Photodegradation in Difluoroboron&#8208;Based Organic Laser Gain Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in difluoroboron&#8208;based gain molecules is shown to originate from aggregated singlet states (S1), contradicting its previously assumed phosphorescent origin. Additionally, the delayed emission arises from a triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) mechanism rather than a thermally activated (TADF) process, with rapid photodegradation further complicating the excited&#8208;state dynamics and emphasizing the need for improved molecular design.








Abstract
In this study, we investigate the triplet exciton dynamics of a series of difluoroboron&#8208;based organic gain molecules. We synthesized three previously reported molecules from the difluoroboron family and examined their photophysical properties using time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations. Our results reveal that emission from these materials arises predominantly from the singlet manifold via prompt and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;driven delayed fluorescence, rather than from phosphorescence, challenging the earlier assumptions of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originating from the triplet manifold. In highly concentrated solutions, the emission shows strong resemblance to that of the crystalline phase, confirming its origin from aggregate singlet states rather than monomeric pathways. Further, the materials are prone to photodegradation, which gives rise to new high&#8208;energy fluorescence and phosphorescence bands adding to the complexity of the photophysics of this family of materials.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbon via High&#8208;Pressure Topochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

Positioning sp3&#8208;CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi&#8208;continuously tune the bandgap of [8]&#8208;AGNR. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization, we synthesized site&#8208;specific sp3&#8208;CH and N co&#8208;substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one&#8208;step synthesis method for producing various [8]&#8208;AGNRs with site&#8208;specific heteroatom substitution.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted broad attention for their potential application in nanoelectronics. The electronic properties of the GNRs are closely related to their chemical structure like width, edge, terminating and hetero atoms, etc., and widely applied synthetic methods for the scalable synthesis of specific GNRs with atom&#8208;scale precision are urgently required. Here, we found that the stoichiometric and ordered positioning of N and sp3&#8208;CH in 8&#8208;armchair&#8208;GNR ([8]&#8208;AGNR) effectively modifies their bandgap in a large range of 0&#8211;2.85&#160;eV by theoretical calculations. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization, three of these [8]&#8208;AGNRs were synthesized successfully in their bulk phase starting from crystalline dipyridinyl/dipyrimidinyl butadiynes, with the maximum nitrogen content of 27% in mass. The structures of these GNRs were demonstrated by spectroscopy, diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance methods. UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectra clearly evidenced the precise tuning of the electronic structures in these N and CH substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs. Our work shows great versatility of this high&#8208;pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site&#8208;specific N and sp3&#8208;CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure&#8208;specific carbon nano&#8208;materials.

Our work shows great versatility of this high-pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site-specific N and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure-specific carbon nano-materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of the Formation of Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes in Liposome&#8208;Based Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ion transporters enable precise control over carboxylate transport across liposome membranes that are preloaded with Ln3+ ions. This process triggers the spatiotemporal formation of luminescent lanthanide complexes within liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors. Cryo&#8208;TEM and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveal that the complexation of lanthanides induces a structural transformation of liposomes from unilamellar to bilamellar vesicles. 








Abstract
The controlled mass transfer across compartmentalised environments in synthetic nanoreactors is essential for enhancing precise spatiotemporal manipulation of chemical transformations within confined spaces. In this study, we present a strategy that integrates a synthetic anion transporter in liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors, allowing for spatiotemporal control over the formation of metal&#8211;organic complexes in liposomes. This approach enables us to effectively modulate the assembly of luminescent lanthanide&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate nanostructures. Fluorescence studies demonstrate that the reaction rate can be customised by varying the anion transporter concentration, which dictates the rate of entry of the carboxylate ligand. Changes in the morphology of the liposome nanoreactors due to the assisted transmembrane transport of benzenedicarboxylate were investigated using cryo&#8208;TEM and time&#8208;resolved SAXS measurements, which revealed a structural transformation of the lipid bilayer during the complex formation. Our findings provide a novel platform for exploring coordination chemistry in nanoscale confinements, opening avenues for the design of biohybrid materials.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI, Electrophoresis&#8208;Correlative Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with AI&#8208;Based Data Processing Broadens Access to Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Proteomics</title>

An affordable single&#8208;cell proteomics workflow combines capillary electrophoresis, real&#8208;time ion sorting, and AI&#8208;aided spectral deconvolution to profile early Xenopus embryonic cells. Despite using a legacy Orbitrap, this strategy matches or exceeds the sensitivity of modern instruments, uncovering proteome dynamics at sub&#8208;nanogram scale.








Abstract
Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry (MS) offers unprecedented sensitivity for profiling cellular proteomes, yet widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of advanced instrumentation. Here, we broaden access to single&#8208;cell proteomics by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE), data&#8208;dependent acquisition (DDA) with electrophoresis&#8208;correlative (Eco) ion sorting, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted spectral deconvolution via CHIMERYS (Eco&#8211;AI). This &#8220;Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI&#8221; workflow was implemented on a custom&#8208;built CE platform coupled to a legacy hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus). Despite slower scan speed, lower resolution, and inferior ion transmission efficiency, real&#8208;time Eco&#8208;DDA sampling and CHIMERYS processing enabled identification of up to &#8764;15 peptides per spectrum&#8212;performance on par with modern Orbitrap Fusion Lumos tribrid systems. From 1&#160;ng of HeLa digest, 2142 proteins were identified, surpassing the 969 proteins detected on a contemporary nanoLC Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Even from &#8764;250 pg (a single&#8208;cell equivalent), 1799 proteins were identified in &lt;15&#160;min of effective separation, raising a theoretical throughput of 48 samples per day. As proof of principle, Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI profiled 1524 proteins from single precursor cells (50&#8211;75&#160;&#181;m diameter) in Xenopus laevis blastulae, revealing proteome asymmetry during neural versus epidermal fate specification. These results establish Real&#8208;Time Eco&#8211;AI as a budget&#8208;conscious yet powerful strategy for single&#8208;cell proteomics using CE&#8211;MS.

         <title>Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Mo Site&#8208;Activated Nanozymes for Bienzymatic/Upconversion Synergistic Catalytic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;O&#8211;Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozyme (HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs) with hyaluronic acid (HA) modification is successfully constructed on up/downconversion (UC/DC) dual&#8208;emissive nanoparticles by a facile hydrothermal method. With the guidance of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), UC&#8208;induced electron&#160;&#8722;&#160;hole pairs synergize with bienzymatic activity to amplify ROS generation, enabling tumor&#8208;specific synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion catalytic therapy (ET/UCT).








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) hold promise for cancer therapy but suffer from low active site density and restricted intermediate adsorption/desorption capabilities. Herein, Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom silicon&#8208;based semiconductor nanozymes (FeMoDA), encapsulated in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LPs) and surface&#8208;modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) (denoted as HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs), were developed for synergistic bienzymatic/upconversion&#8208;triggered catalytic therapy (ET/UCT) under second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidance. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Fe/Mo dual&#8208;atom sites were bridged by Fe&#160;&#8722;&#160;O&#160;&#8722;&#160;Mo coordination, optimizing oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption/desorption, and improving dual&#8208;enzymatic activities. The peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic performance of HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs showed a Km of 11.54&#160;mM and a Vmax of 1.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M&#183;s&#8722;1, outperforming Fe&#8208; or Mo&#8208;single&#8208;atom coated LPs. HA modification promoted endocytosis (&#8764;5.67&#8208;fold) and microenvironmental acidification (pH from 7.21 to 6.74), further improving ET. Under 980&#160;nm irradiation, upconversion&#8208;triggered electrons synergized with oxidase&#8208;like activity to convert O2 into superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;), while holes enabled &#8226;O2&#8722; to singlet oxygen (1O2) conversion, which combined with POD&#8208;like&#8208;produced hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve synergistic ET/UCT. Tumor H+ and glutathione co&#8208;induced the specific degradation of nanozymes, resulting in tumor self&#8208;enhanced downconversion NIR&#8208;II and MR imaging. Compared with conventional SAzymes, HA/FeMoDA&#8208;LPs exhibit superior catalytic performance and dual&#8208;modal imaging, offering a synergistic and tumor&#8208;responsive platform for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Assisted Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient TADF Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.








Abstract
Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron&#8208;withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4tCzCN&#8208;pXT and 4tCzCN&#8208;pTXT, with multiple 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed. They own increased molecular vibrations, which promote intrinsic RISC process and enable multi&#8208;channel transitions via vibronic coupling of high&#8208;lying triplet states.

&lt;p&gt;Based on symmetry breaking strategy, two tailored TADF materials with ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing and high photoluminescence quantum yields are developed, which can function efficiently as emitters in nondoped OLEDs and sensitizers in hyperfluorescence OLEDs, and provide outstanding external quantum efficiencies of up to 31.2% and 40.2%, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process is critical for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials to realize spin&#8211;flip of triplet excitons in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), but the RISC processes of most TADF materials are not fast enough, undermining electroluminescence (EL) efficiency stability and operational lifetime. Herein, a symmetry breaking strategy to accelerate RISC processes is proposed. By designing asymmetric electron-withdrawing backbone consisting of benzonitrile and xanthone/thioxanthone groups, two new asymmetric TADF molecules, 4&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;CzCN-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;XT and 4&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;CzCN-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;TXT, with multiple 3,6-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylcarbazole donors are successfully developed. They own increased molecular vibrations, which promote intrinsic RISC process and enable multi-channel transitions via vibronic coupling of high-lying triplet states. Consequently, they exhibit fast RISC rates of up to 1.24&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, being one order of magnitude higher than that of the symmetric control molecule. They can perform as luminescent materials in OLEDs, providing outstanding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.2% and 35.8% in non-doped and doped devices, respectively, with very small roll-offs. The OLEDs using them as sensitizers for multi-resonance emitters achieve remarkable EQEs over 40%, and extraordinary operational stability with &lt;i&gt;LT&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; of 24974&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating their great potentials in OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal meta&#8208;Allenylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is developed through their redox&#8208;neutral temporary dearomatization to oxazinopyridines under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite, olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This is the first enantioselective functionalization of oxazinopyridines, which results in meta&#8208;allenylic pyridines with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.).








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines is an important yet challenging transformation. Temporary dearomatization of pyridines through redox&#8208;neutral cycloaddition has recently emerged as a reliable and attractive strategy for meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines. Despite the amenability of the resulting bench&#8208;stable cycloadduct, oxazinopyridine, to a variety of electrophilic and radical&#8208;based reagents, its enantioselective functionalization remains unexplored. Herein, we present the first enantioselective meta&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through the intermediacy of oxazinopyridines. This highly enantioselective formal meta&#8208;allenylation of pyridines is achieved by treating the easily accessible oxazinopyridines with racemic allenylic alcohol under the combination of a catalytic amount of an Ir(I)/(P, olefin) complex and Lewis acidic Sc(OTf)3 followed by acid&#8208;mediated rearomatization. With oxazinopyridines derived from unsubstituted or suitably substituted pyridines, iterative 3,5&#8208;difunctionalization is possible, which also allows for the stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;allenylic pyridines.

         <title>Protein Cage Inspired Bridge&#8208;Island Effect Enables Low&#8208;Temperature Targeted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hierarchical Hollow Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose a protein cage inspired ionic weaving strategy that enables the bottom&#8208;up construction of micro/nano hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) under mild conditions. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of soft templates is elucidated, wherein the VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the formation of microscale hollow frameworks and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathodes exhibit outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Achieving targeted morphological control over polyanionic cathodes under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. Drawing inspiration from the self&#8208;assembly of protein cages, we propose an ionic weaving strategy for the low&#8208;temperature fabrication of hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes. By introducing low&#8208;cost monosodium glutamate as a template precursor, the derived glutamate species self&#8208;assemble into hollow micellar soft templates under the coordination bridging of VO2+ ions. Subsequently, PO43&#8211;, Na+, and F&#8211; ions are electrostatically attracted to VO2+&#8208;anchored microdomains, triggering island&#8208;like nucleation. The VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the construction of microscale hollow soft templates and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals, thereby enabling micro/nano hierarchical hollow morphology control of NVOPF under mild conditions. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism underlying hollow soft template formation is systematically elucidated for the first time through a combination of soft matter probing techniques, including fluorescence microscopy and negative staining, supported by density functional theory calculations and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;rate cycling and excellent low&#8208;temperature durability. This work establishes a new paradigm that integrates supramolecular self&#8208;assembly with metal&#8208;ion coordination chemistry for the rational design of fast&#8208;charging polyanionic cathode materials.

Unraveling spacer cation&#8208;mediated degradation in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, this work introduces 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB) as a dual&#8208;functional stabilizer. CFB stabilizer suppresses spacer cation degradation and coordinates multi&#8208;stage crystallization. The corresponding precursor delivers extended shelf life and devices achieve a record&#8208;low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV.








Abstract
The aging dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions critically govern the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, the underlying degradation mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors remain elusive, particularly regarding the pivotal role of spacer cations in modulating decomposition pathways. This study elucidates the intrinsic aging mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, revealing that spacer cation integration fundamentally governs decomposition kinetics. A dual&#8208;functional solution stabilizer, 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB), is strategically designed to concurrently mitigate precursor degradation and regulate crystallization dynamics. The carboxyl moiety undergoes spontaneous deprotonation to establish robust hydrogen bonds with guanidinium (GA+), effectively suppressing methylamine (MA0)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attacks and preventing irreversible addition&#8208;elimination reactions between GA+ and MA0. Simultaneously, CFB orchestrates multi&#8208;stage crystallization control through coordination modulation, yielding highly oriented perovskite crystals with passivated grain boundaries. The optimized devices demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance with a remarkably low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV. Notably, devices fabricated from aged precursors maintain 90% of initial efficiency over 42 days of ambient storage. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices deliver optimized humidity stability and thermal stability.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Homing Liposomal Nanobot for Active Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self&#8208;homing GOD&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis and pH&#8208;guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB&#8208;TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB&#8208;TME through self&#8208;homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self-homing GOD-powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;-glutamyl transferase (GGT)-mediated transcytosis and pH-guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3-fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB-TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)-powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB-TME through self-homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy. The lipoNbot features an asymmetric structure composed of GOD-modified cancer cell membranes and &#947;-glutamylated lipids, which synergistically enhance BBB-TME penetration through chemotactic diffusiophoresis and &#947;-glutamyl transferase (GGT)-mediated transcytosis. The proton sponge effect facilitates lysosomal escape for BBB traversal. In vivo investigation indicates that lipoNbots achieve a 4.3-fold increase in delivery efficiency. Such a lipoNbot poses the specific biochemical cues of GBM for self-homing navigation, establishing a proof-of-concept framework utilizing the pathological features for active therapy of central nervous system diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction via Photoinduced Pd and Pd/Ir Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction is designed by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. Both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;allyl skeletons are achievable and stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is realized.








Abstract
Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction typically relies on the use of alkenes containing an &#945;&#8208;leaving group as the substrates. In comparison, an in situ assembling model from feedstock chemicals represents a distinctive and practically valuable route, yet remains undeveloped. Here we report an unprecedented excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. With the development of a HAT/Heck/allylation cascade protocol, various (E)&#8208;allyl compounds are prepared in good yields and stereoselectivities. Meanwhile, a novel photoinduced Pd/Ir relay catalysis is designed to enable stereoselective preparation of challenging (Z)&#8208;allyl compounds. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is also realized via this excited&#8208;state Pd chemistry, different from typical ground&#8208;state catalytic models. A broad range of N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;derived nucleophiles and different alkenes and esters show high compatibility with the transformation. The protocol is further applied to the concise synthesis of seven bioactive molecules from bulk materials, highlighting the reliability, generality, and practical value of the design. Mechanistic studies support the present design.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Membrane&#8208;Bound Compartment for Precise Regulation of Enzyme Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nature, we report a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment composed of photoisomerizable phenylazothiazole lipids and phospholipids, which enables reversible and graded regulation of enzyme activity. This biomimetic strategy operates without enzyme modification and mutagenesis, offering a versatile and biocompatible platform applicable to a broad range of enzymes.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive systems provide a powerful tool to reversibly regulate enzyme activity. However, inhibitor&#8208;based strategies, though widely used, are often restricted to specific enzymes. Noninhibitor strategies, such as enzyme surface modification or genetic mutation, often compromise structural integrity or residual activity. Inspired by the gating mechanisms of biological membranes, we reported a visible light&#8208;driven membrane&#8208;bound compartment system constructed from phenylazothiazole gated lipids and phospholipids. In this design, phenylazothiazole lipids undergo reversible isomerization between trans and cis configurations under alternating purple and green light, generating continuous nanomechanical motions that transiently enhance membrane permeability. This dynamic gating behavior enables substrate diffusion across the membrane under light exposure and allows the activity of encapsulated enzymes to be switched on and off in a noninvasive, temporally defined manner. This system requires no chemical modification or mutagenesis, thus preserving the native structure and activity of encapsulated enzymes. Beyond binary regulation, precise modulation of the irradiation pattern permits graded control over enzyme activity, offering an advanced level of functional tunability. Using carbonic anhydrase, catalase, and glucose oxidase as models, we demonstrate that enzyme activity can be reversibly and quantitatively regulated via programmable light inputs. This strategy offers a broadly applicable and biocompatible platform for spatiotemporal enzyme regulation.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries through Halogen Bonding Inversion and Non&#8208;Identical&#8208;Frequency Molecular Vibrations</title>

         <dc:description>
The charge preanisotropy of ClAN forms &#963;&#8208;holes specific adsorption, which assures electron&#8208;scale manageable coordination to high valence iodine species (I+). The non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency vibrations response of ClAN with water molecules leads to rapid migration in protic solvents. The combination of the two drives the targeted coordination of the electrolyte additives to I+, breaking the reliance on the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte in conventional multi&#8208;electron transfer zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The activation of four&#8208;electron transfer behavior through I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion reactions is crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) but is hindered by the rapid hydrolysis of I+ in protic solvents. Theoretically, the directionality and modifiability of halogen bonds (XBs) can be used to regulate the hydrolytic disproportionation of I+. Given that the conventional coordination configuration is not applicable because of the locking of the XB donor (I+), the inversion of the coordination configuration to establish a charge distribution preanisotropy (&#963;&#8208;holes) and thus realize XB&#8208;stabilizing electron&#8208;scale coordination is vital for breaking down the barriers existing in protic solvents. To counteract external environmental disturbances, the cohesive energy differentiation based on the Hansen parameter creates the non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations of additives with water. Herein, an electrolyte additive (chloroacetonitrile, ClAN) with these advantages enabled the redox coupling of I&#8722;/I0/I+ at a very low salt concentration (4 molar kg&#8722;1). The corresponding ZIB exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 175.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and showed an extremely high specific capacity at high rates (133.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a generalized framework and new horizons for halogen batteries with multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Development of Indolo&#8208;Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptane as a Carbazole Isostere Through Radical Indolization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of two functional groups&#8212;isonitrile and alkene&#8212;into the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been successfully developed. This reaction offers a direct and efficient synthesis of indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a promising carbazole isostere, with high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that triplet energy transfer plays a pivotal role as a key step.








Abstract
Semisaturated ring systems with a balanced fraction of C(sp3) have garnered increasing attention in drug development. In this study, we propose indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane as a potential carbazole isostere and present a novel strategy for synthesizing this new semisaturated polycyclic scaffold. The synthesis involves using bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as radical precursors/terminators in the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction with 2&#8208;alkenylarylisocyanides, providing a highly efficient approach to construct a tricyclic system in a single step. These reactions represent a rare example of two functional groups (isonitrile and alkene) being sequentially involved in the cyclization process within BCB chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of two functional groups&#8212;isonitrile and alkene&#8212;into the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been successfully developed. This reaction offers a direct and efficient synthesis of indolo-bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a promising carbazole isostere, with high bond-forming efficiency and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that triplet energy transfer plays a pivotal role as a key step.

         <title>Mechanofluorochromic Elastomers Based on Reversible Helical Transition of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymeric mechanofluorochromic (MFC) mechanism is introduced, which utilizes force&#8208;induced conformational transition of the helical main chain in poly(phenylacetylene) from cis&#8208;cisoid to cis&#8208;transoid. This mechanism enables reversible fluorescence behavior, making it applicable to advanced MFC elastomers with high MFC sensitivity and superior reversibility.








Abstract
Mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials possessing both high sensitivity and excellent reversibility are crucial for achieving real&#8208;time mechanical sensing and biomedical probing. Nonetheless, it currently faces the challenge of possessing both critical properties at excellent levels. Herein, we have proposed a reversible polymer mechanochromic mechanophore utilizing a novel mechanism that enables &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence, triggered by a force&#8208;induced helical conformational transition in poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) from the fluorescent compact cis&#8208;cisoid (cc) to the non&#8208;fluorescent loose cis&#8208;transoid (ct) conformation. Upon release, the restoring force, coupled with the reformation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, drives the helical backbone to revert to cc conformation, thus enabling reversible mechanofluorochromism. A series of helical PPAs featuring vinyl groups underwent covalent crosslinking with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), yielding a range of MFC elastomers. We developed an in situ stretching&#8208;fluorescence testing device to achieve real&#8208;time monitoring of force&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By adjusting the crosslinking density, Vi&#8208;CP&#8208;0.01@PDMS&#8208;0.003 exhibited the highest MFC sensitivity. Significantly, the novel MFC elastomer showcases outstanding reversibility, maintaining its performance across 10 cycles. This study demonstrates a novel MFC mechanism that produces elastomers with high sensitivity and excellent reversibility, paving the way for further MFC materials development based on innovative mechanism.

         <title>Breaking the Performance Limit of Pure Metals for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NRR electrocatalysts suffer from low N2 concentration and competitive H2O/*H adsorption. This study proposes three&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized hollow fiber electrodes to boost NRR by elevating local N2 concentration, thereby modulating *N2 and *H coverage. The strategy demonstrates broad applicability across various metal catalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ambient&#8208;condition ammonia synthesis, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the low N2 concentration in aqueous systems and the competing strong adsorption of H2O/H intermediates on conventional bulk metal catalysts. Herein, we propose a universal micro/nanoengineering strategy to address these challenges by constructing three&#8208;phase&#8208;interface&#8208;optimized hollow fiber (HF) electrodes. This design simultaneously enhances local N2 enrichment and modulates the surface coverage of critical intermediates (*N2 versus *H), thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium toward NRR. As a proof of concept, Fe&#8208;based HF electrodes achieve a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 27.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 3.5% under ambient conditions&#8212;values dramatically enhanced by &#8764;60&#8208;fold and &#8764;35&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to planar Fe electrodes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hierarchical porous architecture of HF electrodes promotes N2 diffusion and alters the adsorption hierarchy of intermediates, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution while activating N&#8801;N bond cleavage. Crucially, this strategy demonstrates broad applicability, as evidenced by significantly improved NRR performance across diverse metals (e.g., Cu, Ni), highlighting its potential as a general platform for advancing sustainable ammonia electrosynthesis.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Reductive Regeneration on Cobalt Catalysts Enables Efficient Dual&#8208;Pathway Hydrazine Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway mechanism is unveiled for hydrazine oxidation on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and a mediated pathway involving Co(II)/Co(0) cycling. Defect engineering accelerates the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine, enabling rapid regeneration of Co(0) active site, boosting both activity and durability, and leading to efficient low&#8208;voltage hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low&#8208;energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual&#8208;pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect&#8208;rich cobalt catalyst through a one&#8208;step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only &#8722;79&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual&#8208;pathway HzOR on Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts.

         <title>Partitioning COF Membrane Channels into Ultramicroporous and &#960;&#8208;Electron&#8208;Rich Compartments for Multicomponent Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel partition has been achieved in two novel alkynyl COF membranes by using click chemistry, which results in an ultramicroporous configuration as well as concentrated charge distribution. The resultant COF membranes are capable of efficiently separating multi&#8208;cation mixtures and multi&#8208;anion mixtures.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) build a versatile platform for constructing separation membranes, affording them disruptive candidates for nanoscale molecule/ion sieving. However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual&#8208;azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich structures of triazole ring offer cation&#8208;philic or anion&#8208;repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li+/Mg2+/(K+) and F&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/(Cl&#8722;). Example of dealing with a K+/Li+/Mg2+ ternary mixture, the optimum p&#8208;TpPa&#8208;C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K+/Mg2+ and 30.9 for Li+/Mg2+. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever&#8208;reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high&#8208;performance ion separation membranes.

However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&amp;lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper-catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual-azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;-electron-rich structures of triazole ring offer cation-philic or anion-repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/(K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/(Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Example of dealing with a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ternary mixture, the optimum &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-TpPa-C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9 for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever-reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high-performance ion separation membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quinuclidinium&#8208;Based Microporous Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microporous AEMs with extreme alkaline stability and confinement&#8208;induced high conductivity have been developed for water electrolysis. The presented membrane, poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip), exhibited high OH&#8722; conductivity and record&#8208;setting alkaline stability. The water electrolyzers configured with PTPQ&#8208;Trip can tolerate varied temperatures, current densities, alkaline concentrations, and operation interruptions, and operate continuously under high alkaline concentrations. This work promises the integration of renewable electricity for water electrolysis.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising green hydrogen production method; however, it is constrained by the moderate OH&#8722; conductivity and inadequate alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here we report a series of quinuclidinium&#8208;based AEMs with branched and microporous structures, achieving 99.95% OH&#8722; conductivity retention after 3100&#160;h in 10&#160;M NaOH at 80 &#176;C. By tuning the rigidity of the branching units to limit chain packing, micropores were created to enhance OH&#8722; transport, which improved the diffusion coefficient of OH&#8722; by 1.6 times within the poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip) membrane having the most rigid structure. An AEMWE configured with a PTPQ&#8208;Trip membrane and nickel&#8208;alloy catalysts can tolerate varied alkaline concentrations and deliver a hydrogen production current density of 2.8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;M KOH, which can be continuously operated at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 30 &#176;C for over 1200 h, with intentionally included stop/start interruptions. The assembled AEMWE demonstrated stable operation for 1400 h under alternating operational current densities and varying electrolyte temperatures. This work underscores the critical role of alkaline&#8208;resistant microporous AEMs and highlights the adaptability of AEMWE for hydrogen production using renewable electricity.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Silver Leaching from Manganese&#8211;Silver Ore Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Formation</title>

A simple&#8208;structured, cyanide&#8208;free leaching system exemplifies H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgy by dissociating lattice&#8208;confined Ag in manganese&#8211;silver ore via two&#8208;stage kinetics and forming helical AgCl chains stabilized by CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; hydrogen bonds to enable&#160;&gt;&#160;90% Ag recovery.








Abstract
Silver is an increasingly scarce resource, necessitating green leaching methods for low&#8208;grade ores. Conventional cyanidation, however, suffers from extreme toxicity and environmental hazards that make it unsustainable. We report a nontoxic synergistic leaching system based on oxalic acid and cyano&#8208;functionalized branched quaternary ammonium salts. Under mild conditions, this one&#8208;step method enables efficient and selective leaching of lattice&#8208;confined silver from polymetallic manganese&#8211;silver ore, with recoveries exceeding 90%. Kinetic studies reveal a two&#8209;stage process, with an initial rapid dissolution of exposed manganese oxides releasing silver followed by a slower breakdown of the iron matrix to liberate encapsulated minerals. The core breakthrough is the discovery that AgCl combines with chloride anions from the quaternary ammonium salt to form a unique inorganic helical chain structure. The stability of this helical assembly is attributed to an ordered CH&#8230;Cl&#8722; H&#8208;bonded network. Spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that this network undergoes an energetically favorable reconstruction that overcomes the high lattice energy of AgCl. This finding demonstrates that the cooperative effect of weak H&#8208;bonds can dissociate covalently stabilized solids. Our study thus provides an innovative strategy for sustainable silver metallurgy and introduces a new paradigm of H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed metallurgical design.

         <title>Formal C&#9472;H Functionalization of Quinolines at the C7 Position Through a Traceless Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the remote C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates has been achieved by using a traceless N&#8208;acyl directing group, providing an efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a new family of C7&#8208;functionalized quinolines with high regioselectivity.








Abstract
The precise C&#9472;H functionalization of quinolines is of high interest in organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, although many strategies have been developed for the regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization of the quinoline scaffold, the facile and selective remote C&#9472;H bond functionalization of quinolines at the geometrically and electronically disfavored C7&#8208;position has remained underdeveloped. Here, we disclose a Cu&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates. The reaction features exclusive C7&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, short reaction time, and simple operation. This practical protocol has also been applied in the analogous C7&#8208;H functionalization of tetrahydroquinolines and the further C7&#8208;elaboration of quinolines. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the key to the success of this transformation is the unique ring&#8208;size&#8208;induced in situ removal of the N&#8208;acyl directing group, constituting a traceless directing strategy for the rapid access to a variety of C7&#8208;substituted neutral quinolines.

         <title>Spillover Hydrogen Boosts Nitroarene Hydrogenation to Industrial Activity with Ppm&#8208;Level Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spillover hydrogen significantly enhances the turnover frequency of platinum single atoms, thereby enabling a nitroarene hydrogenation performance comparable to that of industrial catalyst at a low concentration of 300&#160;ppm. The Pt1/Ni@C catalyst provides new insights into the efficient screening of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.








Abstract
The application of noble single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) at trace loadings is constrained by a low space&#8208;time yield, presenting a formidable challenge in elevating the activity of SACs to be comparable to industrial catalysts in nitroarene hydrogenation. In this study, the spillover hydrogen from a carbon&#8208;coated nickel support (Ni@C) coupled with 300&#160;ppm platinum results in a 25.7&#8208;fold enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF, 44.1&#160;s&#8722;1), thereby achieving a space&#8208;time yield equivalent to 1&#160;wt.% Pd/C industrial hydrogenation catalyst. Remarkably, the Pt1/Ni@C catalyst preserves excellent stability under rigorous conditions, including acidic, basic, and oxidative environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spillover hydrogen effectively reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier, with the energy barrier height inversely correlated to the density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen on Pt single atom. Extrapolating the enhanced hydrogenation effect to other SACs and nitroarene substrates shows that spillover hydrogen can either promote or inhibit hydrogenation processes. The density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen serves as a predictive descriptor for discerning the direction of the synergistic effect in single&#8208;atom catalyzed hydrogenation. This study provides insightful guidance for the rational design of more efficient and industrially viable SACs exploiting hydrogen spillover.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spillover hydrogen effectively reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier, with the energy barrier height inversely correlated to the density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen on Pt single atom. Extrapolating the enhanced hydrogenation effect to other SACs and nitroarene substrates shows that spillover hydrogen can either promote or inhibit hydrogenation processes. The density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen serves as a predictive descriptor for discerning the direction of the synergistic effect in single-atom catalyzed hydrogenation. This study provides insightful guidance for the rational design of more efficient and industrially viable SACs exploiting hydrogen spillover.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule F4TCNQ is introduced to bridge MeO&#8208;2PACz and perovskite layer. F4TCNQ homogenizes the buried interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and charge&#8208;transfer complexes, passivates the defects, and promotes perovskite crystallization. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function and enhances charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high VOC of 1.202 V and robust stability.








Abstract
To improve the interfacial match between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite active layer (PAL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is introduced to bridge the self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) and PAL. F4TCNQ eliminates molecular voids in the SAMs via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, forming charge&#8208;transfer complexes that homogenize interfacial potential and promote perovskite crystallization, increasing grain size from 0.53 to 0.88&#160;&#181;m. The cyano groups and fluorine atoms on F4TCNQ passivate Pb2&#8314; and I&#8722; defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding, suppressing ion migration and carrier nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function, reducing the hole extraction barrier by 0.12&#160;eV and enhancing charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.202&#160;V, while retaining 91% efficiency after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, attributed to stabilized ion dynamics and robust interfacial adhesion. This work demonstrates molecular bridging as a scalable strategy for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics.

         <title>Solvent Chain&#8208;Length Engineering Enables All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte is designed by combining short&#8208;chain ethers for fast ion transport with long&#8208;chain glycol ethers to improve thermal and voltage stability, together with DOL and FEC additives. This strategy balances ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, thermal robustness, voltage tolerance, and low&#8208;temperature adaptability, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast charging, long cycle life, and wide&#8208;temperature operation.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;rate capability, long&#8208;term cycling stability, high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains a challenge due to intrinsic solvent trade&#8208;offs. Here, we propose a molecular&#8208;scale electrolyte design strategy addressing this multi&#8208;objective optimization through solvent chain&#8208;length engineering. By coupling short&#8208;chain ethers (low&#8208;temperature kinetics) and long&#8208;chain glycol ethers (high&#8208;voltage/thermal stability) with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), we construct a hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte that redefines Na&#8314; solvation chemistry. Systematic solvent&#8211;solvent interaction modulation weakens Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent binding to accelerate ion transport, while FEC&#8208;induced anion&#8208;rich coordination shells enhance interfacial stability. The hybrid electrolyte enables Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells to deliver an 82.75 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity after 9500 cycles at 10 C, sustain 600&#8208;day operation at 1 C, and function across &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Symmetric Na||Na cells demonstrate stable cycling for over one year. Moreover, the electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with various commercial cathode materials within a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8211;4.5&#160;V and demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in full&#8208;cell systems. This work demonstrates solvent chain&#8208;length&#8208;driven solvation engineering as a viable strategy to concurrently address kinetic, thermodynamic, and interfacial challenges, offering a practical pathway toward all&#8208;climate SIBs with balanced multi&#8208;performance metrics.

         <title>Circumventing Radical Generation on Fe&#8211;V Atomic Pair Catalyst for Robust Oxygen Reduction and Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) proceeds via direct O&#9552;O breaking pathway and thus circumvents the ROS radical generations, fundamentally enhancing ORR stability for perdurable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts are considered the most active platinum&#8208;free alternative for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) from general mechanistic pathway rapidly impair the ORR activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. Herein, we establish and report an ORR pathway&#8208;switching strategy to circumvent ROS generation and fundamentally improve the activity and stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C via DFT guided catalyst design. The constructed Fe&#8211;V atomic pair catalyst (Fe1V1&#8208;NC) with N2Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;VN2 configuration enables side&#8208;on adsorption of O2 and subsequent direct&#8208;breaking of the O&#9552;O bond to form O*, thereby avoiding the formation of ROS radicals. Importantly, there is intersite electron interaction between FeN4 and VN4, which further boosts the ORR activity. Consequently, Fe1V1&#8208;NC exhibits outstanding ORR activity with onset and half&#8208;wave (E1/2) potentials at 1.02 and 0.89&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, in 0.1&#160;M KOH. Record&#8208;high stability is achieved on Fe1V1&#8208;NC with a minimal decay in E1/2 by 16&#160;mV over 50000 cycles, surpassing Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C counterpart and most of the catalysts reported to date. The Fe1V1&#8208;NC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air battery reported here demonstrates exceptional durability up to 400&#160;h at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. This work identifies the intrinsic correlation between ORR pathway, activity, and stability, advancing development of stable catalytic systems.

A facile non&#8208;destructive polyanion (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;) electrointercalation strategy was developed to synthesize facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx (T&#160;=&#160;&#8722;Cl, &#8722;NH, &#8722;Br). The as&#8208;delaminated oligolayer Ti3C2Clx sheets retained their pristine features of oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination, along with long cycling performance of 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 when serving as a coating material for Zn anode.








Abstract
Tailoring surface chemistry and achieving non&#8208;destructive interlayer exfoliation are crucial for controlling MXene properties. Conventional synthesis strategies typically involve damaging intercalation processes and yield MXenes with mixed surface terminations, compromising their functionality. Herein, we propose an anodic etching strategy to produce facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx from Ti3AlC2 in low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8208;NaCl&#8208;KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti3C2Clx (MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer&#8208;induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn2+ capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non&#8208;destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.

         <title>Computational Study of Ignored Pericyclic Reactions: Rearrangements of 1,2&#8208;Bis(Diazo)Alkanes to 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrazines and Subsequent Fragmentations</title>

DFT calculations of the 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkanes and of other bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles reveal that this process can establish a so far ignored route to heterocycles such as 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. Alternative reaction channels via carbenes or nitrenes leading to fragmentation products are discussed. The computations identified substitution patterns that could allow the characterization or isolation of the elusive 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The C2&#8208;symmetric geometries of the transition states point to a conrotatory electrocyclic process. 








Abstract
An electrocyclic ring closure of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles can afford six&#8208;membered heterocycles. This 8&#960;&#8208;electron process was systematically analyzed by DFT calculations with 1,2&#8208;bis(diazo)alkane derivatives as possible precursor compounds and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines as products. The C2&#8208;symmetry of the transition state of the parent system points to a conrotatory ring closing event. The subsequent (6&#8211;2&#8211;2) cycloreversions of these elusive nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles to alkynes or nitriles and dinitrogen were also computationally investigated. The results show that the reactions are strongly dependent on the substitution pattern, but all are kinetically easily feasible delivering products of differing stability. The calculations can therefore provide important information for experimental endeavors to generate or even isolate so far unknown 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazines. The feasibility of carbene or 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;substituted nitrene intermediates for the formation of alkynes is also discussed. The experimental evidence for the proposed processes is enclosed presenting literature known examples of the fragmentation reactions which can most convincingly be explained by the intermediacy of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazine derivatives. Furthermore, the electrocyclic ring closure reactions of five other types of bis&#8208;1,3&#8208;dipoles are calculated, demonstrating that this so far ignored 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization&#160;process can establish a new route to interestingly composed heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Design for Enhancing Metal&#8208;Support Frontier Orbital Interaction to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>

Based on atomic structure design, this study developed AuNPsNi1CN photocatalyst, a novel structure with defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal nanoparticle loading strategies. N vacancies enhance the metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between Ni single atoms and the g&#8208;C3N4, improving H+ supply capacity through 4e&#8722; WOR. Au nanoparticles serve as 2e&#8722; ORR sites, achieving an H2O2 yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water.








Abstract
Modified g&#8208;C3N4 has been widely applied in various photocatalytic reactions. However, designing efficient atomic structures, breaking through the activity bottleneck and elucidating the precise reaction mechanisms remain the critical challenges in photocatalyst development. This work developed one innovative photocatalyst atomic structure design (AuNPsNi1CN) with Ni single atoms, N vacancies and Au nanoparticles (NPs) at g&#8208;C3N4. N vacancies enhancing metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between the Ni electron orbitals and the g&#8208;C3N4&#8217;s frontier orbitals, forming a highly active site for four&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (4e&#8722; WOR), which significantly enhanced the proton (H&#8314;) supply capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the introduced Au NPs produce H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieving a yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni single atoms cause a regulation in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), enhancing the oxidation capability of holes, while the Au NPs optimize O2 adsorption energy and lower the reaction barrier for 2e&#8722; ORR. This atomic&#8208;scale structure design strategy combining defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal NPs loading, provides a novel approach for developing efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable, Sequence&#8208;Specific Metal&#8208;Nucleic Acid Scaffolds for Responsive Uncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that long&#8208;range nucleic acid&#8208;mediated electron transfer can drive Pt(IV) photoreduction, establishing a new class of metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffolds capable of &#8220;responsive uncaging,&#8221; where hybridization with target DNA or miRNA directly triggers payload release under NIR irradiation.








Abstract
Precise molecular activation with both analyte specificity and spatiotemporal control remains a major challenge in responsive diagnostics, targeted therapies, and the study of complex biological systems. Traditional photo&#8208;uncaging strategies offer excellent temporal resolution but suffer from limited tissue penetration and poor biological specificity, while analyte&#8208;responsive platforms provide molecular selectivity without external control. Here, we introduce sequence&#8208;responsive diagnostic uncaging&#8212;a unique approach that integrates nucleic acid recognition with near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered molecular activation within a metal&#8208;nucleic acid scaffold. This platform is built upon a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind Pt(IV)&#8208;DNA molecular scaffold, modularly assembled via click chemistry, and integrates a Pt(IV)&#8208;caged reporter, a nucleic acid recognition domain, and an NIR antenna (e.g., IR800). Notably, DNA&#8208;mediated electron transfer (DNA&#8208;MET) provides a long&#8208;range ET pathway to direct photoreduction of the Pt(IV) centers, enabling &#8220;responsive uncaging&#8221; that occurs only upon hybridization with a fully complementary DNA or miRNA strand. Upon NIR irradiation, the duplexed nucleic acid system facilitates electron transfer from the excited antenna to Pt(IV), triggering the release of fluorescent reporters. Using two Pt(IV)&#8208;caged fluorophores (MCA and BDP), we demonstrate efficient uncaging and high sequence specificity in both solution and live cells. This platform offers a powerful and versatile photochemical tool that seamlessly bridges diagnostics and molecular activation, with broad implications for precision medicine, targeted drug delivery, and next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that long-range nucleic acid-mediated electron transfer can drive Pt(IV) photoreduction, establishing a new class of metal-nucleic acid scaffolds capable of &#8220;responsive uncaging,&#8221; where hybridization with target DNA or miRNA directly triggers payload release under NIR irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise molecular activation with both analyte specificity and spatiotemporal control remains a major challenge in responsive diagnostics, targeted therapies, and the study of complex biological systems. Traditional photo-uncaging strategies offer excellent temporal resolution but suffer from limited tissue penetration and poor biological specificity, while analyte-responsive platforms provide molecular selectivity without external control. Here, we introduce sequence-responsive diagnostic uncaging&#8212;a unique approach that integrates nucleic acid recognition with near-infrared (NIR)-triggered molecular activation within a metal-nucleic acid scaffold. This platform is built upon a first-of-its-kind Pt(IV)-DNA molecular scaffold, modularly assembled via click chemistry, and integrates a Pt(IV)-caged reporter, a nucleic acid recognition domain, and an NIR antenna (e.g., IR800). Notably, DNA-mediated electron transfer (DNA-MET) provides a long-range ET pathway to direct photoreduction of the Pt(IV) centers, enabling &#8220;responsive uncaging&#8221; that occurs only upon hybridization with a fully complementary DNA or miRNA strand. Upon NIR irradiation, the duplexed nucleic acid system facilitates electron transfer from the excited antenna to Pt(IV), triggering the release of fluorescent reporters. Using two Pt(IV)-caged fluorophores (MCA and BDP), we demonstrate efficient uncaging and high sequence specificity in both solution and live cells. This platform offers a powerful and versatile photochemical tool that seamlessly bridges diagnostics and molecular activation, with broad implications for precision medicine, targeted drug delivery, and next-generation biosensing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State and Interfacial Lock in Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers Enable Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;cable polymer extends the charge&#8208;transfer state lifetime to over 3&#160;ns, boosting the efficiency of ternary organic solar cells to 20.12%. It also serves as an interfacial lock at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface, significantly enhancing device stability.








Abstract
The donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) critically govern exciton dissociation and molecular diffusion, determining both efficiency and stability. Herein, we design a double&#8208;cable conjugated polymer, SC&#8208;1F, to insert into a physically&#8208;blended D/A system to optimize the interface. We have found that SC&#8208;1F spontaneously segregates to the interface through favorable miscibility and heterogeneous nucleation with the acceptor. Its long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state with a lifetime of &gt;3&#160;ns enhances charge generation efficiency in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.00% to 20.12%. More importantly, the double&#8208;cable nature of SC&#8208;1F enables it to be simultaneously miscible with donor and acceptor so as to act as the interfacial lock to prevent their self&#8208;aggregation under thermal treatment. Therefore, the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based solar cells provided a high T80 of 2175 h compared to a T80 of 530 h based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 under 65 &#176;C treatment. Notably, SC&#8208;1F&#8208;based device demonstrates exceptional storage and thermal stability, with a T80 lifetime exceeding 10&#160;000 h. These results demonstrate the superior advantage of double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers as the third component to achieve efficient and stable OSCs.

The Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2&#8314; on surface trench&#8208;like structures of high lattice distortion MnOx, by inducing *OH generation/enrichment and electron transfer respectively, drive furoic acid (FA) dehydrogenation to carbon&#8208;centered FA radical (FA*), then reduce FA* to FA carbanion (FA&#8722;), completing Csp2&#9472;H bond activation. Under supercritical conditions (390&#160;K, 8&#160;MPa), solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 accelerates carboxylation of FA&#8722; to FDCA&#8722;, achieving 95.8% FDCA selectivity.








Abstract
Developing the efficient C&#9472;H bond activation carboxylation processes for furoic acid (FA) represents a critical technological challenge in achieving atom&#8208;economical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Despite notable advancements in this field, the inherent contradiction between the high reactivity of furan rings and the chemical inertness of C&#9472;H bonds poses substantial technical bottleneck for achieving controllable C&#9472;H carboxylation under mild conditions. Herein, we report a high lattice&#8208;distorted MnOx catalyst with surface trench&#8208;like structures, wherein the Mn&#948;+&#8208;OV&#8208;conjugated configurations and electron&#8208;rich Mn2+ cooperatively drive FA dehydrogenation and carbon radical reduction, inducing the free radical evolution process (FA&#8594;carbon&#8208;centered FA radical&#8594;FA carbanion), then coupled with solvent&#8208;polarized CO2 to accelerate the carboxylation process. This approach achieved an FDCA selectivity of 95.82% under mild reaction conditions (&#8804;390&#160;K), providing novel insights into mild activation and conversion of biomass&#8208;derived inert chemical bonds.

We report light&#8208;responsive &#8220;RNA photofluids&#8221; created by the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These functional liquids can harness the molecular motion of nanomachines into macroscopic, cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light.








Abstract
Incorporating artificial molecular machines into soft matter offers a compelling strategy for engineering active materials with life&#8208;like behavior. Here, we report ultraviolet and visible light&#8208;responsive RNA photofluids formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These RNA photofluids can harness the molecular motions of RNA nanomachines to produce macroscopic cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We show that the number of azobenzene moieties in the RNA nanomachines controls the deformation kinetics and critical transition temperatures between structural deformation and dissociation. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible RNA photofluids not only enable direct solar energy harvesting for light&#8208;powered soft robotics, but also expand the toolkit for developing advanced multi&#8208;responsive biomaterials and programmable artificial cells.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Optimized Film&#8208;Forming Processes Lead to Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Modules Fabricated with Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20&#8208;based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm2) and modules (19.44&#160;cm2) processed from m&#8208;xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.








Abstract
While the transition from halogenated to eco&#8208;friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6&#8208;ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non&#8208;halogenated solvent of m&#8208;xylene. More importantly, Tz2Cl units induce the enlarged electrostatic potential difference between PM6&#8208;ClTz20 and the acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9, giving donor&#8211;acceptor electrostatic attraction. This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in m&#8208;xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase&#8208;separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small&#8208;area device (0.0476&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (19.44&#160;cm2), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film&#8208;forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.

This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase-separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6-ClTz20:BTP-eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small-area device (0.0476&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and mini-module (19.44&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film-forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Structure&#8208;Engineered Proton Depletion Interfaces on Ternary RuO2 for Ultra&#8208;Stable Kilowatt Electrocatalysis</title>

Achieving kilowatt&#8208;level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self&#8208;accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.








Abstract
Advancing high&#8208;current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt&#8208;scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO2&#8208;based catalyst (Cr0.1Sn0.1Ru0.8O2) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled&#8208;up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred&#8208;ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large&#8208;scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources. Our techno&#8208;economic analysis predicts that leveraging this anode architecture can reduce hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg H2 while maintaining a substantially lower environmental footprint relative to conventional electrolyzer technologies.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Copper&#8211;Silver Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral hybrid copper&#8211;silver halide, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4, is reported as the first single&#8208;crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguide. Combining intrinsic CPL activity and low&#8208;loss light guiding, these microrods exhibit glum values of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and optical loss coefficients as low as 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1, offering a new platform for spin&#8208;photonic integration.








Abstract
Chiroptical waveguides, capable of generating and propagating circularly polarized light (CPL), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, developing novel, efficient chiroptical waveguides remains challenging, due to the difficulty of integrating strong intrinsic chiroptical activity with efficient directional light transport within a single crystalline material. Here, we report a new enantiomeric pair of chiral hybrid metal halides, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4 (S/R&#8208;CuAg), featuring a one&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure. Ag incorporation enhances photoluminescence quantum yield from 0.6% to 18.6%, while enabling bright CPL emissions with dissymmetry factors (glum) of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The tightly packed inorganic lattice and highly anisotropic microstructure of S/R&#8208;CuAg exhibit a low optical loss coefficient of 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1. Crucially, microrod crystals of S/R&#8208;CuAg function as efficient chiroptical waveguides, simultaneously emitting and propagating CPL under unpolarized light excitation. This work establishes chiral hybrid metal halides as a viable platform for circularly polarized waveguide applications.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Bridged Compact Interfacial Shielding for Practical Seawater Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte is designed using natural seawater solvent and a host&#8211;guest complex additive. The MBT guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the CD host dominated by aqueous solubility. Cl&#8722; facilitates a compact MBT shield on the Zn anode surface via bridging effect, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion.








Abstract
Substituting natural seawater (NS) for deionized water significantly reduces the electrolyte manufacturing cost of aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries, but it also poses severe corrosion challenges to the Zn metal anode, given the presence of the Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Here, a NS electrolyte featuring NS solvent and the host&#8211;guest complex additive is designed. The 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the cyclodextrin host dominated by its aqueous solubility in the NS electrolyte. Crucially, Cl&#8722; ions facilitate a compact MBT shield at the interface via bridging effects, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion and extends Zn anode cycle life. Thus, the Zn anode achieves an extended cycling life of 400&#160;h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell even under a practical depth of discharge of 42.7%. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.92 exhibits 99% capacity retention at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles, and the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an initial discharge capacity of 1.21 Ah maintains stable cycling for 50 cycles.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Stabilized Organic Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Cell Operating at &#8722;40&#176;C</title>

Leveraging hydrogen bonds (HB) and &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions, BQXTO enables a potassium&#8208;ion full cell (versus hard carbon anode) to deliver 188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy and 1331.5&#160;W kg&#8722;1 power density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature energy storage systems confront severe operational constraints due to sluggish ion kinetics and electrolyte solidification. While potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer potential for low&#8208;cost energy storage, the absence of viable cathode materials with adequate stability at ultra&#8208;low temperatures remains a critical barrier. Herein, we demonstrate an organic small molecule, 1,4&#8208;dihydrobenzo[g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,5,10&#8208;tetraone (BQXTO), in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB) and robust &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions synergistically enhance charge transfer and impart insolubility, thereby facilitating reaction kinetics and improving cycling stability even under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The assembled BQXTO||HC potassium&#8208;ion full cell achieves remarkable energy density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability (88.2% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). This study presents valuable insights into the structure design of organic small molecule cathodes for advanced low&#8208;temperature PIBs.

The assembled BQXTO||HC potassium-ion full cell achieves remarkable energy density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (188&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and exceptional cyclability (88.2% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). This study presents valuable insights into the structure design of organic small molecule cathodes for advanced low-temperature PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allosteric Activation of Cas12a via PAM Topological Engineering for Direct and Rapid Detection of Nucleases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via PAM topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) that enables direct, rapid detection of nuclease activity without multistep conversion was developed. Upon nuclease recognition, the Y&#8208;COPE is transformed into a dsDNA activator via split PAM reconfiguration to activate Cas12a, which provides an effective pathway for straightforward and sensitive detection of nonnucleic acid targets via CRISPR&#8208;based platforms.








Abstract
A contemporary question in the intensely active field of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based molecular diagnostics is how to simplify the multistep conversion process for detecting nonnucleic acid targets. Herein we describe an allosteric Y&#8208;shaped DNA structure for Cas12a activation via protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM) topological engineering (Y&#8208;COPE) to achieve straightforward and diverse nuclease monitoring. The newly designed topological structure of the Y&#8208;COPE is characterized by a split PAM embedded at the three&#8208;way junction and protospacers flanking both sides. This unique spatial configuration of the PAM effectively prevents Cas12a activation. Upon target cleavage, the released truncated fragments can dynamically correct the PAM, which promptly restores the dsDNA conformation for Cas12a activation and accomplishes signal output. Theoretical calculation results revealed that, compared with the canonical dsDNA activator, in the Y&#8208;COPE, there was a 1.8&#160;&#197; increase in the center distance between Lys595 of Cas12a and the PAM, which led to a 24.2&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1 increase in binding free energy. This clearly revealed the underlying inhibition mechanism of the topological configuration of the PAM for Cas12a activation. This study advances the understanding of the dynamic response of Cas12a to topological PAM conformations and introduces the universal concept of CRISPR&#8208;based nonnucleic acid detection to benefit the next&#8208;generation molecular diagnostics.

         <title>Sterically Congested LLX&#8208;Type PNSi Tridentate Ligands for Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligands for non&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation were developed. Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) efficiently promoted the reaction in sharp contrast to an Ir/PN catalyst. The sterically congested Ir/PNSi catalysts realized steric&#8208;controlled C&#8211;H borylation. Notably, C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation of para&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes was successfully achieved in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H.








Abstract
Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) were developed as new effective catalysts for the C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of alkanes and alkyl groups that do not have directing groups. The Ir/PNSi catalysts were prepared in situ from [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 and 8&#8208;diarylphosphino&#8208;2&#8208;[(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydrosilyl)methyl]quinolines, which are readily synthesized from commercially available 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;methylquinoline. The Ir/PNSi catalyst exhibited higher chemoselectivity than a standard Ir/Me4phen and our previously reported Ir/NNSi catalysts. Thus, the Ir/PNSi catalysts promoted selective borylation of the sterically less crowded C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in 2&#8208;methylheptane and dibutyldimethylsilane. The C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds was also achieved with the Ir/PNSi catalysts in the reaction of 4&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes. Such notable chemoselectivity may be due to the congested environment around the iridium center formed by the mer&#8208;tridentate coordination of the PNSi ligands.

         <title>Continuous Flow Photocatalysis Boosting C&#9472;N Coupling for Sustainable High&#8208;Efficiency Formamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow photocatalytic platform for formamide synthesis via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of methanol and ammonia over the Pd clusters decorated TiO2 catalyst has been developed. The system has achieved a record formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 with 50 h stability in a Taylor flow reactor, which is significantly superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules.








Abstract
The construction of C&#9472;N bonds from simple precursors under ambient conditions is a fundamental challenge in green chemistry, especially when it comes to avoiding energy&#8208;intensive protocols. Here, we present a continuous flow photocatalytic platform that enables the efficient coupling of C&#9472;N bonds between methanol and ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure. By synergistically engineering a Pd clusters&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst (1Pd/TiO2) and a mass transfer&#8208;enhanced gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid Taylor flow reactor, the system achieves a remarkable formamide productivity of 256.80&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (6.83&#8208;fold enhancement compared to batch reactors) with less than 10% decay in production rate over 50 h of continuous operation, which is remarkably superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic systems for the synthesis of C&#9472;N compounds from C1 small molecules. Distinguishing from the conventional simultaneous bimolecular one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway, a mechanistic study has shown that the precisely tailored Pd clusters on TiO2 induce charge polarization to drive methanol dehydrogenation toward critical *CH2O intermediates, enabling direct nucleophilic NH3 attack for C&#9472;N bond formation, thereby circumventing thermodynamic/kinetic barriers inherent to asynchronous radical generation in prior systems. This work establishes a paradigm for the sustainable, efficient synthesis of formamide via photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling by bridging nanoscale photocatalyst engineering with macroscopic reactor design.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine palladium phosphide (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub&#8208;2&#160;nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol








Abstract
Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defect&#8208;rich TiO2&#8208;supported Pd (Pd/d&#8208;TiO2) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d&#8208;TiO2 defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of PdxPy during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed PdxPy nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&#8722;1. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d&#8208;TiO2 (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&#8722;1) and large&#8208;sized PdxPy (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO2 (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&#8722;1). The enhanced performance of PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation&#8208;induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H2 formation.

     alt="Sub-2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine palladium phosphide (Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) with sub-2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect-assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub-2&#160;nm Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) with sub-2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect-assisted anchoring strategy, using defect-rich TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Pd (Pd/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-sized Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The enhanced performance of Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation-induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. Our findings provide a novel and effective approach for the controllable synthesis of ultrafine noble metal phosphides by leveraging the defect-anchoring effect, advancing both atomic economy and selective hydrogenation catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
We report the synthesis and cooperative reactivity of a bifunctional silylene&#8211;aminoborane compound, 1&#8208;Ph&#8208;2&#8208;tBu&#8208;1H&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzazaborolyl&#8208;(amidinato)silylene (1), designed to preserve the ambiphilicity of both functional units while preventing intramolecular deactivation. 1 engages in unprecedented multicomponent activations of unsaturated bonds, including alkynes and phosphaalkynes, to construct novel main&#8208;group element embedded polycyclic frameworks. Reaction with alkynes led to rare main&#8208;group elements enriched semibullvalenes via highly regioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition. Notably, reaction with a phosphaalkyne induced a distinct SNAr&#8208;like B&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation of a B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P&#8208;embedded barrelene analogue. Structural and computational analyses revealed the synergistic multi&#8208;site activation modes and reaction pathways.

         <title>In Situ Orthogonal Chemistry for Facile Preparation of Uniform COF&#8208;Based Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs is achieved via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF within the polymer, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) represent a promising platform for advanced lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, conventional physical fabrication methods may suffer from cumbersome processing, filler agglomeration, and high interfacial resistance. Here we report the in&#8208;situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) within LMBs. Notably, the H2O generated from the polycondensation reaction effectively serves as the chain transfer agent for THF ROP, reducing the molecular weight of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) to facilitate Li+ transference, instead of corroding the lithium anode. This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF fillers within the polymer matrix, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination. Consequently, the ionic conductivity increases 80&#8208;fold (2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) with a Li+ transference number of 0.81 at room temperature. Coupled with a fluorine&#8208; and boron&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from BF3, the CPEs endow Li/LiFePO4 half batteries with excellent cycling stability. This work provides a paradigm for designing interface&#8208;compatible electrolytes through spatially controlled orthogonal synthesis.

         <title>Polymer Ligands with Quaternary Ammonium Binding Motifs on Metal Nanoparticles Enable Selective Ion Transport for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic polymer ligands with positively charged head groups show a profound impact on the transport of ions and water at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface. Under negative bias, bicarbonates as counterions are preconcentrated, while extended hydrophobic polymers modulate the hydrogen bonding network among water. 








Abstract
We report a new class of hydrophobic polymer ligands with quaternary ammonium head groups for surface modification of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). Quaternary ammonium ligands bind NPs through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions, producing polymer&#8208;grafted NPs with high colloidal and chemical stability. These polymers having charged head groups offer powerful strategies to tailor the structure and function of metal&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in electrocatalytic systems. The ammonium head groups serve as ionic reservoirs that preconcentrate bicarbonate counterions at the surface of nanocatalysts, while the hydrophobic polymer backbones restructure local hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, modulating water and ion transport dynamics. These interfacial effects promote CO2 electroreduction, particularly under diffusion&#8208;limited conditions, resulting in a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 90%.

         <title>Gradient Polarization Induces Three&#8208;Dimensional Asymmetric Electron Distribution in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient polarization induces a 3D asymmetric charge distribution and built&#8208;in electric field, thereby achieving efficient in&#8208;plane/interlayer charge transfer and N2 fixation. Moreover&#65292;the generated polarized confined microenvironment stabilizes intermediates, achieving high NH4+ and NO3&#8722; yields.








Abstract
Constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, yet the spatial conformation imposes inherent trade&#8208;offs between in&#8208;plane and interplane carrier transport. Here, we present a spatial gradient polarization strategy that combines distinct electronegativities of (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups in COFs to establish a 3D asymmetric electron distribution and the gradient polarization. Mechanistic studies have shown that the gradient polarization triggers the interlayer dipole rearrangement in a nonpolar orientation, thereby constructing a cooperative in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization field. This polarization field decouples the constraints on carrier transport and drives rapid charge transfer in an anisotropic manner, breaking the traditional perception of D&#8208;A intramolecular polarization within the plane. Moreover, the resulting polarized microenvironment activates N&#8801;N bonds, optimizes hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, and stabilizes reaction intermediates, enabling the sequential conversion pathway of nitrogen. Ultimately, the covalent organic framework containing (NH)2&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups (SBO) exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance with yields of NH4+ and NO3&#8722; of 11.59 and 7.18&#160;mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing all reported systems. Additionally, under natural sunlight, SBO also achieves unprecedented NH4+ (87.17&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (73.63&#160;mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) yields. Our research not only offers a strategic blueprint for modulating the 3D polarization in COFs but also bridges the gap in the relationship between the molecular structure of materials and the spatial carrier migration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D-A)-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is an effective approach to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, yet the spatial conformation imposes inherent trade-offs between in-plane and interplane carrier transport. Here, we present a spatial gradient polarization strategy that combines distinct electronegativities of (NH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C&#9552;S and C&#9552;O groups in COFs to establish a 3D asymmetric electron distribution and the gradient polarization. Mechanistic studies have shown that the gradient polarization triggers the interlayer dipole rearrangement in a nonpolar orientation, thereby constructing a cooperative in-plane and out-of-plane polarization field.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Alloying Small&#8208;Cation into Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Motif Gives Multiaxial Ferroelectrics with Enhanced Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a series of multiaxial bismuth&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics with organic mixed&#8208;cations, of which the most active candidate enables the photocurrent enhancement ratio reaches up to 4800%, far beyond those known ferroelectrics. This work affords a new avenue for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photoactive ferroelectrics have shown huge potentials for assembling high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Bismuth&#8208;based halides are emerging as a vigor ferroelectric subclass due to unique structural diversity and flexibility, while studies on their photo&#8208;ferroelectricity coupling remain extremely scarce. Here, we have alloyed organic mixed&#8208;cations into Bismuth&#8208;based prototype to design a series of new multiaxial ferroelectrics with strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity, as notably exemplified by (BZA)2(DMA)BiBr6 (1, where BZA is benzylammonium; DMA is dimethylammonium). The dynamic motions of small DMA+ cation afford the driving force to trigger symmetry breaking of 3&#175;mFm$\bar 3m{\rm F}m $, thus giving its multiaxial ferroelectricity with 6 equivalent polarization directions. Strikingly, 1 exhibits photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a broad ultraviolet&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral range (266&#8211;980&#160;nm), which couples with ferroelectric bulk photovoltaics to create giant photocurrent enhancement ratio of &#8764;4800%. This merit far surpasses those of known ferroelectric materials. These results shed light on the design of new photoactive ferroelectric candidates for smart photoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Reduction of Rare&#8208;Earth Stannole Sandwich Complexes to Tin&#8208;Based Radical Ligands and Tin&#8211;Tin Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of dimetallic rare&#8208;earth stannole complexes with KC8 produces a di&#8208;tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two&#8208;electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M2Sn2} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.








Abstract
f&#8208;Element organometallic chemistry is dominated by cyclopentadienyl ligands. In contrast, isoelectronic metallole ligands with the general formula [EC4R4]2&#8722;, where E is a heavier group 14 element, are rare in the f&#8208;block, particularly stannole ligands. Here, we describe the synthesis of the dimetallic stannole complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M&#160;; M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy; CpSn = [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt = [1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2]&#8722;), which form by virtue of Sn&#8594;M dative bonds. One&#8208;electron reduction of 1M with KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces the mono&#8208;anionic complexes [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M), and two&#8208;electron reduction gives di&#8208;anionic [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M) as [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts. Studies of the stannole complexes using crystallography, UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy, magnetometry and computational methods reveal that the reduction steps generate tin&#8211;tin bonds through population of a delocalized molecular orbital that spans the {M2Sn2} rings, with attendant dearomatization of the stannole rings. Complexes 2M are the first tin&#8208;radical ligands bound to rare earth elements. Spin density calculations of 2Y and 2Gd reveal significant build&#8208;up of unpaired spin on the tin atoms, with magnetic measurements on 2Gd yielding an unprecedentedly large tin&#8211;gadolinium exchange coupling constant of &#8722;112&#160;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2J formalism).

         <title>K+ Vacancies and Fluorine Substitution Synergistically Regulate KTiOPO4 Anode for All&#8208;Climate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K+ vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full&#8208;cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Although Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO4 (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K+ vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites. The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K+ ions. The synergistic effect of K+ vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K+ vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K+ and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1. Practical full&#8208;cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The synergistic effect of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Practical full-cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all-climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity of a Phosphinidene Telluride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis and isolation of a phosphinidene telluride. This species acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer reagent accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium.








Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphorus(III) telluride is reported. The compound was accessed by means of a double bond metathesis reaction between an amido&#8208;functionalized phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP&#9552;O (Ar&#160;=&#160;bulky aryl substituent), with a silylene telluride, L(NMe2)Si&#9552;Te (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2). The resulting phosphinidene telluride, BnArNP&#9552;Te, exhibits a short P&#9552;Te bond (2.297(1) &#197;), resulting from a significant p&#960;&#8211;p&#960; orbital interaction between the phosphorus(III) and tellurium(&#8722;II) atoms. Key to the stabilization of this compound is the amido substituent associated with the phosphorus atom, which provides kinetic stabilization due to its steric bulk but also significant thermodynamic stabilization through negative hyperconjugation of the nitrogen atom lone pair into antibonding orbital interactions between phosphorus and tellurium. The title compound acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer platform, accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium to afford other phosphorus(III) compounds via transient phosphorus(V) intermediates.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Driven Conformational Switching of Binaphthalene&#8208;Based Tetraimidazolium Macrocycles to Enhance Sequence&#8208;Selective Recognition of Dinucleotides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media using binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycle as artificial host is reported. The macrocycle undergoes reversible conformational switching with temperature, transitioning from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;conformation. This temperature&#8208;driven switching enhances binding with d(TpA) and achieves high sequence selectivity (Krel &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K) in water, demonstrating its potential for developing temperature&#8208;sensing optical devices for detecting DNA or RNA fragments with specific nucleotide sequences.








Abstract
Developing artificial hosts with temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching behaviors facilitates our understanding of the temperature&#8208;dependent allostery and adaptation mechanisms in natural recognition systems. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of three pairs of water&#8208;soluble, enantiomeric binaphthalene&#8208;based tetraimidazolium macrocycles (SS/RR&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; &#8211; SS/RR&#8208;3&#8226;4Cl&#713;) as artificial hosts for exploring sequence&#8208;selective recognition of dinucleotides in aqueous media. Owing to the reversible rotational conformation of axially chiral binaphthyl units, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; demonstrates the conformational switching, converting from cis&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1cis) to trans&#8208;conformation (SS&#8208;1trans) by increasing temperature, thereby causing the recognition cavity to transition from a closed to an open state. Given its ability for temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713; exhibits temperature&#8208;cooperative enhanced binding behavior with d(TpA), with association constants (Ka) increasing to &#8764;106&#160;M&#8722;1 at 323&#160;K, up from &#8764;104&#160;M&#8722;1 at 288&#160;K. In contrast, its affinity for other dinucleotides, including d(ApT), d(GpC), and d(CpG), decreases to varying extents with increasing temperature. As a result, SS&#8208;1&#8226;4Cl&#713;, with an ability of temperature&#8208;driven conformational switching, achieves an unexpected sequence&#8208;selective recognition for the sequence&#8208;complementary dinucleotide pair d(TpA) and d(ApT), with high sequence selectivity factors (Krel&#160;=&#160;Ka[d(TpA)]/Ka[d(ApT)]) reaching up to &#8764;118.8 at 323&#160;K, increased from &#8764;1.1 at 288&#160;K, in water.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Anisotropic Grain Growth in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic grain growth during sintering is characterized by an initial preference for the [104] and [110] directions, followed by accelerated growth along the [003] orientation. Low&#8208;valence dopants (Mg2+/Al3+) facilitate grain boundary migration (n&#160;about 2), while high&#8208;valence ions (Mo6+) suppress the behavior via segregation (n&#160; about 4.5), enhancing cycling stability.








Abstract
The particle morphology governed by anisotropic grain growth of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes plays a crucial role in electrochemical stability and can be tuned via element doping during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. However, the fundamental impact of dopants on the anisotropic grain growth kinetics remains unclear. Herein, this work systematically investigates how dopants with different valences (Mg2+, Al3+, Zr4+, Ta5+, and Mo6+) affect the anisotropic grain growth during the high&#8208;temperature lithiation process. The findings demonstrate that the grain growth rate along the [104] and [110] directions is initially faster, followed by a higher growth rate along the [003] direction. The coarsening exponents n for the grain growth (along the [003], [104], and [110] directions) with low&#8208;valence ions (Mg2+, Al3+) dopants are approximately equal to 2, indicating that the grain growth depends solely on short&#8208;range diffusion at the grain boundary. Interestingly, the n value along the [003] direction enlarges with an increase in valence. Notably, the higher valence of Mo6+ results in a significant elevation of the exponent n along the [003] direction to 4.5, indicating a strong pinning effect due to Mo6+ segregation at the grain boundary. This pinning impedes grain boundary migration, inhibits grain coarsening, and effectively enhances cycle stability.

This work presents a crystallographically confirmed heterodimetallic monomeric complex (TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co) featuring a U&#8801;Co triple bond (2.189&#160;&#197;). Remarkably, this complex could act as a catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkyne.








Abstract
The crystal structure of heterodimetallic monomeric complexes featuring a U&#8211;M triple bond has been rarely reported. Here, we present an example of a heterodimetallic monomeric complex [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co)] (4) containing a U&#8211;Co triple bond, which was synthesized by the reaction of [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Cl)] (2) or [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U] (3) with CoCl2 in the presence of KC8. The crystal structure of 4 reveals a highly&#160;symmetrical&#160;geometry with a linear Co&#8211;U&#8211;Namine axis line, and the U&#8211;Co bond length 2.1890(11) &#197; is slightly longer than the sum of the covalent triple&#8208;bond radii of uranium and cobalt (2.14&#160;&#197;). The U&#8211;Namine bond length (2.439(6) &#197;) is significantly shortened compared to that of precursors 2 and 3. The significant contraction of the U&#8211;Namine bond demonstrates electronic reinforcement via the inverse trans&#8208;influence (ITI). Detailed computational investigations further support the existence of a U&#8801;Co triple bond in 4, and the formal oxidation states of uranium and cobalt appear to be U(IV) and Co(&#8208;I). The low&#8208;temperature magnetic moments of 4 are approaching 2.1 &#956;B, which is attributed to its near&#8208;doubly degenerate spin&#8208;orbit ground states in the pseudo&#8208;C3v symmetry. Remarkably, 4 served as the catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkynes under mild conditions.

         <title>Strengthening Intermediate Adsorption on a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Assembly by Polymeric Modification for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction into Methanol</title>

Poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) modification of cobalt phthalocyanine nanotubes boosts electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol by 14&#8208;fold enhancement of turnover frequency. The pyridyl groups axially coordinate to cobalt centers, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediate to decreased the reaction barrier.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) to generate value added methanol (MeOH) in water has been considered as a potential strategy to realize efficient carbon cycle and reutilization. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) represents as a classical molecular catalyst carrying precisely tunable active sites, which has been widely explored for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH conversion, but optimization of performance is suffering from relatively easiness in desorption of *CO intermediate. To this end, we developed a novel molecular assembly of CoPc nanotubes (CoT) driven by van der Waals force with surface being modified by poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). The as&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance of MeOH production for the turnover frequency enhanced by more than 14&#8208;fold compared to the pristine CoT, and the Faradaic efficiency is up to 40% at a moderate potential. It revealed that the pyridyl groups of P4VP axially coordinated with the Co catalytic centers shifted the d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediates, thereby decreasing the whole barrier to produce MeOH. This work demonstrates a novel insight into intermediate manipulation of CO2R and highlights the potential of molecular electrocatalysis for carbon valorization.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;photon Absorption Switch via Cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;Salt&#8208;to&#8208;Cocrystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation, we construct for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch between upconversion and Stokes emission. This single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) interconvert for 20 cycles, demonstrating an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials, which holds promising applications in display devices and rewritable information storage.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive organic cocrystals are typically governed by single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation, remaining a long&#8208;standing challenge due to disruption of long&#8208;range order structure throughout the whole solid&#8208;state process. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch based on reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal SCSC transformation. While both para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene and meta&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene coassemble with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) into cocrystals via donor&#8211;acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonds, only the former cocrystal exhibits broad&#8208;window TPA activity alongside enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Theoretical calculations confirm that positional isomerism of electron donors modulates molecular coplanarity and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in cocrystals, directly controlling TPA cross&#8208;sections. Remarkably, para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene undergoes diprotonation by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid, enabling the conversion of the cocrystal to a salt form, which can be reverted upon triethylamine treatment. This cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation switches the TPA characteristics with reversible color changes between upconversion orange emission and Stokes yellow luminescence for 20 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials. Based on the unique acid&#8208;responsive emission, we also apply the SCSC transformation in display devices and information storage. This study elucidates structure&#8208;property relationships governing TPA in cocrystals and establishes a new paradigm for stimuli&#8208;responsive optical switches.

         <title>Programmable Bio&#8208;Derived Noncovalent Glass via Reconfigurable H&#8208;Bonding Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a programmable glass via reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks between natural biomolecules and organic acids, redefining glass as an active material medium with encoded structural logic. The strategy expands the frontiers of glass chemistry toward sustainable electronics, transient architectures, and environmentally adaptive materials.








Abstract
Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next&#8208;generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio&#8208;derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four&#8208;dimensional control: hydration&#8208;tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid&#8208;guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature&#8208;activated self&#8208;healing, and closed&#8208;loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus&#8211;response modes. Critically, the configurability of H&#8208;bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold&#8208;casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to energy&#8208;intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging&#8212;transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

We synthesized novel hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene via radical copolymerization of ethylene with isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester, followed by oxidation of the boron pendant. Kinetic studies and product analyses suggested that the hydroxy group could be uniformly introduced into a moderately branched PE backbone (i.e., medium density) to achieve unique poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl vinyl alcohol) exhibiting 41% crystallinity. 








Abstract
Radical copolymerization of ethylene was performed with alkenyl boronate, and post&#8208;polymerization oxidation was conducted to synthesize hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene (PE). The copolymerization behavior was dependent on the molecular structure of the boron monomer: the copolymerization with &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted monomer carrying boronic acid pinacol ester [isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester (IPBpin)] afforded copolymers with higher molar masses than the vinyl&#8208;type monomer [i.e., vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin)]. The content of the boron&#8208;pendant units was up to 7 mol%, and kinetic studies suggested the incorporation of boron&#8208;pendant units in a discrete manner. The post&#8208;polymerization oxidation of the boron pendants on the copolymer proceeded quantitatively, affording a hydroxy&#8208;containing polyethylene. The introduction of a hydroxy group had a significant impact on the crystallization behaviors.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Visualisation of Reaction Kinetics and Dynamics: Single&#8208;Molecule Insights into the Iminium&#8208;Catalysed Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Optical microscopy is commonly used to observe simple turn&#8208;on/off phenomena in chemical reactions. A method is presented for the real&#8208;time monitoring of diverse reaction pathways at the single&#8208;molecule level using optical microscopy. This technique enables detailed kinetic and dynamic studies to be performed, providing new insights into catalyst design and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Investigation of the fundamental microscopic processes occurring in organic reactions is essential for optimising both organocatalysts and synthetic strategies. In this study, single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was employed to study the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction catalysed by a first&#8208;generation MacMillan catalyst, providing direct insights into its kinetic dynamics. This reaction proceeds via a series of reversible processes under equilibrium conditions (S &#8644; IM1 &#8644; IM2 &#8594; P, IM1 and IM2: N,O&#8208;acetal and iminium ion intermediates, respectively). The individual reaction trajectories of single molecules were directly observed in real&#8208;time, and the kinetic transitions between the different states were quantitatively analysed using a hidden Markov model, thereby enabling precise determination of the kinetic rate constants and transition probabilities at the single&#8208;molecule level. In particular, the unique structural features of the MacMillan catalyst were probed to reveal how specific interactions stabilise the reaction intermediates and influence their kinetic behaviours. These findings highlight the importance of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of organic reactions and guiding the rational design of more effective catalysts.

         <title>Evolution of Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters with Intrinsic Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich excited&#8208;state dynamics of intrinsically chiral silver nanoclusters tethering cationic species on the surface demonstrates the excited&#8208;state dependent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), suggesting the temporal evolution of exciton distribution.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is a powerful tool to probe the chiroptical properties of molecular systems in the excited state. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of excited&#8208;state chiroptical property in silver nanoclusters (NCs) by CPL measurements. The use of bidentate thiolate ligand, 1,3&#8208;benzenedithiol (BDT), with the aid of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), affords racemic [Ag29(BDT)12(PPh3)4]3&#8722; NCs (Ag29 NCs) with intrinsic chirality in the exterior cage composed of a silver(I)&#8208;dithiolate coordination framework, that are separable by chiral column chromatography. We have recently reported that the post&#8208;synthetic modification of negatively charged Ag29 NCs with a cationic silver(I) complex on the exterior cage stabilizes a specific excited state with a triplet character, enhancing photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. While the same modification on the separated enantiomeric NCs does not change the circular dichroism (CD) profile so much, the CPL activity is dramatically enhanced with an increase in the anisotropy factor (|glum| value) from &lt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 to 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, demonstrating the excited&#8208;state dependent CPL property of Ag29 NCs. In combination with the picosecond PL decay study, the low&#8208;temperature CPL measurement indicates the time development of excited&#8208;state property, suggesting the possible evolution of CPL activity.

         <title>3D Gas Diffusion Layer with Dual&#8208;Metal Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE, achieving a remarkable FEC2+ of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE with a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The chitosan&#8208;induced 3D structure enhances CO2 accessibility, while DFT simulation reveal the tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#8208;Ag dual sites&#8212;Cu activates CO2 into CO* and Ag promotes CHO* formation, enabling asymmetric coupling for C2+ products.








Abstract
Achieving satisfactory C2+ products selectivity and current density in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) remains a challenge for the practical applications. Here, we design a 3D&#8208;CuAg&#8208;GDE for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products, which shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.04% at &#8722;0.88&#160;V versus RHE and a partial current density of 565.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the chitosan with multiple functional groups induces the formation of 3D architecture, which enhances the accessibility of reactive sites and mitigates the limitations associated with CO2 diffusion. The abundant hydrogen bonds between chitosan and CO2 promote the adsorption and enrichment of reactant. Furthermore, the Cu site exhibits stronger activation capacity for CO2 and facilitates the subsequent electron transfer process for the formation of intermediate *CO. The DFT simulation also reveals the thermodynamic favorable for *CO migrating from Cu site to Ag site. Moreover, the Ag site exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy for the protonation of *CO to *CHO, which facilitates the asymmetric coupling of *CO (Cu site) and *CHO (Ag site), ultimately enhancing the generation of C2+ products. Consequently, the unique 3D structure and tandem synergistic interaction of the Cu&#9472;Ag dual sites achieves high activity for eCO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ products.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of In2O3 Using in Situ Raman Spectroscopy: Bridging Material Dynamics and Sensor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 (cubic/rhombohedral) homojunctions are designed for room&#8208;temperature NO2 sensing, achieving an ultrahigh response (1208 to 5&#160;ppm). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals reversible phase transitions, identifying rhombohedral In2O3 as the dominant active phase for NO2 interaction. This real&#8208;time structural analysis directly correlates phase dynamics with sensor response, resolving a key uncertainty in MOS sensing mechanisms. 








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors still face the critical challenge of high operating temperatures. While material engineering strategies have enabled room&#8208;temperature operation, the dynamic evolution of active phases during sensing&#8212;a key factor governing structure&#8208;activity relationships&#8212;remains poorly understood due to the lack of real&#8208;time characterization techniques. Here, we design phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 homojunctions (cubic/rhombohedral) via graphene&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis and demonstrate their exceptional NO2 sensing performance at room temperature. The optimized In2O3/graphene (In2O3/G) hybrid exhibits a 20&#8208;fold enhancement in response (1208 versus 58 for pure In2O3 at 5&#160;ppm NO2), achieving ultrahigh sensitivity with minimal power consumption. By employing in situ Raman spectroscopy to probe structural dynamics during gas exposure, we identify a reversible phase transition between cubic and rhombohedral In2O3, with the rhombohedral phase acting as the dominant active site for NO2 adsorption/desorption. This real&#8208;time observation of phase&#8208;dependent reactivity establishes a direct correlation between transient structural changes and sensor response, resolving a long&#8208;standing ambiguity in MOS&#8208;based sensing mechanisms. Our findings not only pinpoint the active phase but also provide a generalizable methodology to bridge nanoscale material dynamics with macroscopic device functionality, paving the way for rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors still face the critical challenge of high operating temperatures. While material engineering strategies have enabled room-temperature operation, the dynamic evolution of active phases during sensing&#8212;a key factor governing structure-activity relationships&#8212;remains poorly understood due to the lack of real-time characterization techniques.

         <title>Steering Amide Synthesis from Acetonitrile by Electrochemically Derived Active Superoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectively formed in situ superoxide radicals, &#8226;&#9472;O2&#8722; via oxygen electroreduction are highly active for amide bond formation to synthesize acetamide from acetonitrile with 94% selectivity under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Amides with unique carbonyl&#8208;nitrogen linkage are fundamental functional groups that are active and essential for a wide range of natural and synthetic products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and key intermediates. Amide bond formation is one of the most fundamental reactions in chemistry. Conventional amide synthesis faces challenges of poor atom economy and reliance on hazardous reagents. Herein, we present a tandem electro&#8208;thermal catalytic pathway for the synthesis of acetamide from acetonitrile, leveraging electrochemically generated superoxide radicals to steer oxygen insertion under ambient conditions. The superoxide radicals were formed via controlled electroreduction of molecular oxygen. In 1&#160;M K2CO3 electrolyte containing methanol, we achieved over 94% selectivity toward acetamide at a total current density up to 104&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a productivity of 878&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies reveal that the superoxide radicals stabilized by a buffered alkaline environment facilitated the nucleophilic C&#9472;O coupling at the nitrile group, while the presence of methanol quenched the hydroxyl radicals and effectively suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of acetamide to acetate. This coupled electro&#8208;thermal catalysis enables the synthesis of a large variety of amides and may inspire more complex organic synthesis through active oxygen species&#8208;mediated process.

         <title>From Solvent to Catalyst: In Situ Amino Acid&#8208;Like Species Enable PET Upcycling Without Added Catalysts</title>

Amino acid logic meets solvent design: A bioinspired strategy leveraging the acid&#8208;base synergistic catalysis of in situ&#8208;generated amino acid&#8211;like species from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) enables external catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization of waste polyesters into valuable carboxylates and ethylene carbonate.








Abstract
Chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a promising route to value&#8208;added chemical production, yet conventional methods typically demand harsh conditions and dedicated catalysts. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy that exploits the intramolecular acid&#8208;base synergy of amino acids for efficient PET depolymerization. Alanine functions as a bifunctional organocatalyst, enabling complete PET esterolysis by dimethyl carbonate within 3&#160;h at 180 &#176;C to afford dimethyl terephthalate (98%) and ethylene carbonate (80%). Extending this concept, trace water in N&#8208;methyl &#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone induces in situ generation of 4&#8208;(methylamino)butyric acid, which emulates amino acid bifunctionality and enables catalyst&#8208;free depolymerization under identical conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an intramolecular dual&#8208;site acid&#8208;base mechanism, where &#8211;COO&#8722; and &#8211;NH2&#8314;&#160;groups cooperatively activate methanol and PET carbonyls through hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic transition states, lowering the barrier by &#8764;29&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1. The method extends broadly to polyesters and polycarbonate, while establishing a transferable design paradigm that translates catalytic principles from nature into organocatalyst and solvent design, underscoring solvent molecular design as a general lever for sustainable catalysis and plastic upcycling.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterovalent Alloying Hybrid Double Perovskite Solid Solution for Elevating Ferroelastic Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 45, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we constructed a novel family of intrinsic hybrid double perovskite solid solutions, which greatly enhances and expands the photoelectric response across the entire visible light range.








Abstract
Hybrid double perovskites (HDPs), as the main candidates for lead&#8208;free materials, have attracted great attention in the construction of ferroelectrics, ferroelastics, and high&#8208;efficiency photodetectors. However, the photoelectronic performance of HDPs, including bandgap and carrier transport efficiency, is still far behind compared to lead&#8208;based analogues. Excavate effective strategies to bridge this gap has always been an ongoing challenge. Herein, for the first time, we present a family of intrinsic solid solution based on heterovalent metal ions of HDPs, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)X8 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Such solid solution effectively improves the structural stacking mode, and thereby not only inducing 4/mmmF2/m type ferroelastic phase transition but also making a narrower optical bandgap (&#8764;1.74&#160;eV) of (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 lower than that of HDP counterparts. Benefiting from the collaborative overlap of wide absorption range and promoting effect ferroelastic domains on carrier transport, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 exhibits a photocurrent switching ratio (Ion/Ioff) greater than 100 and photoelectric response across the entire UV&#8211;vis range. In short, this work provides a new perspective for improving the physical performance of HDPs.
