         <title>Towards the circular economy: converting aromatic plastic waste back to arenes over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21  st  century owing to its disruptive impact on environment. Here, we show the first example of the catalytic conversion of various aromatic plastic wastes with C&#8211;O and/or C&#8211;C linkages to arenes (75&#8208;85% yield)&#160; via catalytic hydrogenolysis over Ru/Nb  2  O  5&#160;  catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single&#8208;component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb  2  O  5&#160;  , which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbO  x  species for C&#8211;O bond activation and Br&#248;nsted acid sites for C&#8211;C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels via dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations, but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight (MW) stereoregular polyesters. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PheOCA (OCA from phenylalanine) mediated by unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalyst generates highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with MW up to 150.0 kDa. Specifically, high MW Ph&#8208;PLA exhibits 30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation at break in comparison to its low MW congener. Moreover, active species of the polymerization are moisture&#8208;tolerant and can be conducted in unpurified solvent, facilitating facile synthesis of high MW stereoregular polyesters with pendant functional groups.  Calculations and experiment studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (e.g., cyclization, epimerization and transesterification).</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting of Folding and Aggregation by Orthogonal Hantzsch Luminophores within a Single Polymer Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting, fluorescence methods for monitoring&#160; folding and aggregation of proteins have a long history in biochemistry. Placing orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both folding (i.e., its intra&#8208;molecular compaction to isolated single&#8208;chain nanoparticles, SCNPs) and unbidden aggregation (i.e., the inter&#8208;molecular association of SCNPs) remains as a great challenge. Herein, a simple and efficient platform to identify both single&#8208;chain compaction and inter&#8208;molecular aggregation phenomena via photoluminescence is presented based on simultaneous synthesis through Hantzsch ester formation of orthogonal luminophores within the same polymer chain. Hence, starting from non&#8208;luminescent beta&#8208;ketoester&#8208;decorated chains, intra&#8208;molecular compaction is visually detected through fluorescence arising from Hantzsch fluorophores generated as intra&#8208;chain connectors during folding. Complementary, inter&#8208;molecular association is identified via aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from orthogonal luminophores displaying intense photoluminescence at redshifted wavelengths after formation of multi&#8208;SCNPs assemblies. This strategy holds promise to perceive with the naked eye the aggregation state / compaction degree of SCNPs during functional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with systems that operate out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous mRNA Triggered DNA&#8208;Au Nanomachine for in Situ Imaging and Targeted Multimodal Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of versatile nanotheranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functions have always been an intractable challenge in precise cancer treatment. Herein, an aptamer&#8208;tethered deoxyribonucleic acids&#8208;gold particle (Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au) nanomachine has been developed for in situ imaging and targeted multimodal synergistic therapy of mammary carcinoma. Upon specifically internalized into MCF&#8208;7 cells, the tumor&#8208;related TK1 mRNA activates the Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine via DNA strand displacement cascades, resulting in the release of fluorophore and antisense DNA as well as the aggregation of AuNPs for in situ imaging, suppression of survivin expression and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the controlled released drugs are used for chemotherapy, while under the laser irradiation the loaded photosensitizer produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic therapy. The results confirm that the proposed Apt&#8208;DNA&#8208;Au nanomachine provides a powerful nanotheranostic platform for in situ imaging&#8208;guided combinatorial anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Water Trimer Loop: Isotopic Study of Benzophenone&#8208;(H2O)1&#8208;3 Clusters with Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic interplay between different kinds of noncovalent interactions is crucial to explain the structures of molecular clusters. In this study, we examined the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis of the experimental structures shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move to the top of one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer. The analysis of the rotational spectra reveals that the water trimer moiety in the complex adopts an open&#8208;looped arrangement. In contrast, ab initio calculations face a dilemma of identifying the global minimum between the open loop and the closed loop, which is only solved when zero&#8208;point vibrational energy correction is applied. A noncovalent interaction analysis indicates that an OH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bond and a B&#252;rgi&#8211;Dunitz interaction between benzophenone and the water trimer are present in the cluster. This work throws light on the subtle balance between water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions when the solute molecule offers several different anchor sites for water molecules.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synergistic interplay between different kinds of noncovalent interactions is crucial to explain the structures of molecular clusters. In this study, we examined the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis of the experimental structures shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move to the top of one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer.

         <title>TBD&#8208;Enhanced Activity of Peroxide Intermediates in Phosphine&#8208;Free &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD), in absence of either metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were carried out to study the mechanism. In addition to initiating the reaction by proton abstraction, a more important role of TBD was revealed to enhance the oxidizing ability of peroxide intermediates, allowing DMSO an efficient substitute of commonly used phosphine reductants. Further characterizations with the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) confirmed the double hydrogen bonds between TBD and ketone, and kinetic studies suggested the attack of dioxygen on the TBD&#8208;enol adduct to be the rate&#8208;determining step. This work uncovered the enhancing role of TBD on the oxidizing ability of peroxides, and should encourage the application of TBD as a catalyst for oxidations.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (  SOF&#8208;1  ) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce  M  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  or  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with g  abs  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with g  lum  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  induced by  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (g  abs  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8208;4  ) and CPL (g  lum  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8722;4  ) of  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  from achiral  SOF&#8208;1  can be presented using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4 equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of  SOF&#8208;1  can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral  SOF&#8208;1  as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g.,  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Polymerization in Porous Organic Frameworks: a Strategy to Fabricate Anchored Polymers and Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerizations in confining systems provide a strategy to form materials with hierarchical constructions of linear polymers and 3D architectures. However, in this field, anionic polymerization is almost unexplored: we have filled the gap by implementing an anionic mechanism to create polymers and copolymers as confined to, or anchored to, high surface area porous nanoparticles. Far diverse linear polymers with soft and glassy chains, such as polyisoprene and polymethylmethacrylate, were produced by confined anionic polymerization in 3D networks of porous aromatic frameworks. Alternatively, multiple anions were generated on the designed frameworks which bear removal protons at selected positions, and initiate chain propagation, resulting in chains covalently connected to the 3D network. Such growth can continue outside the pores to produce polymer&#8208;matrix nanoparticles coated with anchored chains.&#160; Sequential reactions were promoted by the  living  character of this anionic propagation  ,  yielding nanoparticles that were covered by a second polymer anchored by anionic block&#8208;copolymerization. The intimacy of the matrix and the grown&#8208;in polymers was demonstrated unconventionally by magnetization transfer across the interfaces in 2D  1  H&#8208;  13  C&#8208;HETCOR NMR spectra. The present achievements open intriguing perspectives for the use of versatile anionic polymerization to finely control interdigitated nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. Here, we report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also revealed a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. More importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic materials, that are soft, photoresponsive, programmable and capable of versatile shape&#8208;morphing, have become an emerging paradigm for the development of next&#8208;generation smart robots with wireless controllability and biomimetic functions. Herein, we report near&#8208;infrared (NIR)  light&#8208;driven shape&#8208;morphing of programmable MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel actuators that are fabricated through  in situ  free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a judiciously designed MXene nanomonomer with thermosensitive hydrogel network.  A low electric field (few V mm  &#8208;1  ) was found to enable a spatial distribution of MXene nanosheets and hence introduce the anisotropy into the hydrogel network. Programmable anisotropic hydrogel actuators were developed by controlling ITO electrode pattern, direct&#8208;current (DC) electric field direction and mask&#8208;assisted photopolymerization.  As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept,  we demonstrate NIR light&#8208;driven shape morphing of the MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel into various shapes and devise a four&#8208;arm soft gripper that can perform distinct photomechanical functions such as grasping, lifting/lowering down and releasing an object upon sequential NIR light exposure. The proposed strategy would provide impetus into the development of programmable and reconfigurable smart actuators that can find promising applications in diverse areas such as soft robotics or machines, biomedical devices and beyond.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a cerium catalyzed aerobic oxidative ring expansion for the expedient construction of synthetically challenging macrolactones under visible&#8208;light conditions. Cyanoanthracene has been employed as co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the turnover of cerium cycle leading to a fast conversion within 20 min of irradiation. Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally&#8208;simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9&#8208; to 19&#8208;membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound controlled anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of platelet decorated microglia for targeted ischemic stroke therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stroke is a neurological disease with poor prognosis. Strong inflammatory and immune response exist after stroke, resulting in severe sequelae with high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for stroke as its specific anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of microglia at stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and can realize on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization with the ultrasound responsive IL&#8208;4 liposome decoration. Intravenously injected microglia platform showed anticipated anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at stroke site with insonation control and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;tern stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis and functional recovery, indicating the implications of microglia platform for stroke therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>500&#8208;Fold Amplification of Small Molecule Circularly Polarised Luminescence through Circularly Polarised FRET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amplification of circularly polarised (CP) luminescence of a small chiral molecule embedded within an achiral polymer matrix is demonstrated. This amplification (from |gPL|=0.0003 to 0.15) is observed in several achiral polymer hosts, due to electrodynamic coupling between the electric and magnetic transition dipoles of the donor (polymer) and acceptor (small molecule), which results in efficient CP F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer.







Abstract
Strongly dissymmetric circularly polarised (CP) luminescence from small organic molecules could transform a range of technologies, such as display devices. However, highly dissymmetric emission is usually not possible with small organic molecules, which typically give dissymmetric factors of photoluminescence (gPL) less than 10&#8722;2. Here we describe an almost 103&#8208;fold chiroptical amplification of a &#960;&#8208;extended superhelicene when embedded in an achiral conjugated polymer matrix. This combination increases the |gPL| of the superhelicene from approximately 3&#215;10&#8722;4 in solution to 0.15 in a blend film in the solid&#8208;state. We propose that the amplification arises not simply through a chiral environment effect, but instead due to electrodynamic coupling between the electric and magnetic transition dipoles of the polymer donor and superhelicene acceptor, and subsequent CP F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. We show that this amplification effect holds across several achiral polymer hosts and thus represents a simple and versatile approach to enhance the g&#8208;factors of small organic molecules.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Analysis of NifB with a Full Complement of Clusters: Structural Insights into the Radical SAM&#8208;Dependent Carbide Insertion During Nitrogenase Cofactor Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without and with a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters, which provide important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with the formation of a cofactor core.







Abstract
NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Herein, we report the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without (apo MtNifB) and with (holo MtNifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo MtNifB contain a partial TIM barrel core, but unlike apo MtNifB, holo MtNifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. The radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster is coordinated by three Cys, and the adjacent K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with in silico docking of SAM in holo MtNifB, suggests the binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.

A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

The heterogeneous metal&#8208;organic framework Bi&#8208;BTC can catalyze the conversion of bio&#8208;based 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and acrylic acid into para&#8208;xylene with a promising yield (92&#8201;%) under relatively mild conditions (160&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar).







Abstract
The heterogeneous metal&#8208;organic framework Bi&#8208;BTC successfully catalyzed the synthesis of para&#8208;xylene from bio&#8208;based 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and acrylic acid in a promising yield (92&#8201;%), under relatively mild conditions (160&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar), and with a low reaction&#8208;energy barrier (47.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The proposed reaction strategy also demonstrates a remarkable versatility for furan derivatives such as furan and 2&#8208;methylfuran.

         <title>A Tubular DNA Nanodevice as a siRNA/Chemo&#8208;Drug Co&#8208;delivery Vehicle for Combined Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autonomous tubular DNA nanodevice is constructed to deliver a chemotherapeutic drug and siRNAs. This nanodevice can realize on&#8208;demand targeting, respond to stimuli in the intracellular environment and release multiple molecular payloads for combined antitumor activity.







Abstract
Using the DNA origami technique, we constructed a DNA nanodevice functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) within its inner cavity and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), intercalated in the DNA duplexes. The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression. Combining RNA interference and chemotherapy, the nanodevice induced potent cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition, without observable systematic toxicity. Given its autonomous behavior, exceptional designability, potent antitumor activity and marked biocompatibility, this DNA nanodevice represents a promising strategy for precise drug design for cancer therapy.

         <title>Structural Basis for &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimicry and Inhibition of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions with Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide to oligourea replacements have been employed to generate high&#8208;affinity foldamer ligands targeted to specific proteins. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of several peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids bound to their respective protein targets confirms the high degree of &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry that can be achieved with oligoureas and reveals general principles enabling the design of more stable peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
Efficient optimization of a peptide lead into a drug candidate frequently needs further transformation to augment properties such as bioavailability. Among the different options, foldamers, which are sequence&#8208;based oligomers with precise folded conformation, have emerged as a promising technology. We introduce oligourea foldamers to reduce the peptide character of inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI). However, the precise design of such mimics is currently limited by the lack of structural information on how these foldamers adapt to protein surfaces. We report a collection of X&#8208;ray structures of peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids in complex with ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and vitamin&#8197;D receptor and show how such hybrid oligomers can be designed to bind with high affinity to protein targets. This work should enable the generation of more effective foldamer&#8208;based disruptors of PPIs in the context of peptide lead optimization.

         <title>Recent Advances in Catalytic Hydrosilylations: Developments beyond Traditional PlatinumCatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes recent advancements in catalysts for the hydrosilylation of olefins and alkynes. Emphasis is given on developments of alternative catalyst systems such as non&#8208;noble metal complexes and heterogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation reactions, which allow the addition of Si&#8722;H to C=C/C&#8801;C bonds, are typically catalyzed by homogeneous noble metal catalysts (Pt, Rh, Ir, and Ru). Although excellent activity and selectivity can be obtained, the price, purification, and metal residues of these precious catalysts are problems in the silicone industry. Thus, a strong interest in more sustainable catalysts and for more economic processes exists. In this respect, recently disclosed hydrosilylations using catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals, for example, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn, and heterogeneous catalysts (supported nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom sites) are noteworthy. This minireview describes the recent advances in this field.

         <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single&#8208;molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Anisotropic Growth Limitations of Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films with large lateral size and much thinner thickness. A surface energy modifying strategy was proposed that achieves anisotropic growth, freestanding single&#8208;crystal CsPbBr3 halide perovskite films with a thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to one centimeter.







Abstract
It is extremely challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films (SCHPFs) with not only desired transport properties but also large lateral size with much thinner thickness. Here, we report the growth of freestanding single crystal CsPbBr3 SCHPFs with thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to centimeter for the first time. A new model for growth kinetics (&#936;=Aexp[&#8722;(EA&#8722;Es)/(kBT)]) is proposed to address the surface energy and temperature effect on the growth rate of ultrathin CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal film. The experimental results and DFT calculations both demonstrated that the surfactant plays a critical role in modifying the surface energy and achieving anisotropic growth. This work opens new opportunities for high&#8208;quality SCHPFs with large lateral size and controllable thickness that may find wide applications for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Optimized Active Layer Morphologies via Ternary Copolymerization of Polymer Donors for 17.6&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar cells with Enhanced Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 was developed by incorporating the third 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz) unit into the PM6 backbone. The introduction of DTBTz can tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties, and then optimize the morphology and electrical properties of devices, ultimately improving fill factor (0.77) and thus device efficiency (17.6&#8201;%).







Abstract
Regulating molecular structure to optimize the active layer morphology is of considerable significance for improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we demonstrated a simple ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by incorporating the 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). This method can effectively tailor the molecular orientation and aggregation of the polymer, and then optimize the active layer morphology and the corresponding physical processes of devices, ultimately boosting FF and then PCE. Hence, the PM6&#8208;Tz20: Y6&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77. Using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6%. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy to optimize the active layer morphology of OSCs for improving photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Synthesis of a Sidewall Fragment of a (12,0) Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly strained carbon nanobelt (CNB) containing an octabenzo[12]cyclacene unit was synthesized and isolated in a single crystal form. It shows local aromaticity and highly shielded chemical environment in the cavity. Benzo&#8208;annulation and phenyl substitution are crucial to the successful synthesis of this CNB.







Abstract
Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt (CNB) is a very challenging task in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of an octabenzo[12]cyclacene based CNB (6), which can be regarded as a sidewall fragment of a (12,0) carbon nanotube. The key intermediate compound, a tetraepoxy nanobelt (5), was first synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and subsequent reductive aromatization gave the fully conjugated CNB 6. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unambiguously confirmed the belt&#8208;shaped structure of 6. 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS, and 2D/3D ICSS) revealed localized aromaticity and stronger shielding chemical environment in the inner region of the belt. The optical properties (absorption and emission) of 6 were studied and correlated to its electronic structure. Strain analysis indicates that the phenyl substituents at the zigzag edges are crucial to the successful synthesis of 6. This report presents a new strategy towards highly strained CNBs.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Dependent Morphology of Copper Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction Revealed by In&#8197;Situ Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper catalyst for electrochemical CO2 conversion has been unraveled in situ down to the atomic scale using electrochemical atomic force microscopy under highly gas&#8208;evolving reaction conditions. Oxidized copper surfaces enter different morphological regimes in cathodic potential ranges down to &#8722;1.1&#8197;VRHE coupled with surface reconstructions and varying density of undercoordinated reaction sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical AFM is a powerful tool for the real&#8208;space characterization of catalysts under realistic electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) conditions. The evolution of structural features ranging from the micrometer to the atomic scale could be resolved during CO2RR. Using Cu(100) as model surface, distinct nanoscale surface morphologies and their potential&#8208;dependent transformations from granular to smoothly curved mound&#8208;pit surfaces or structures with rectangular terraces are revealed during CO2RR in 0.1&#8197;m KHCO3. The density of undercoordinated copper sites during CO2RR is shown to increase with decreasing potential. In&#8197;situ atomic&#8208;scale imaging reveals specific adsorption occurring at distinct cathodic potentials impacting the observed catalyst structure. These results show the complex interrelation of the morphology, structure, defect density, applied potential, and electrolyte in copper CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Stiffness Tomography of Ultra&#8208;Soft Nanogels by Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface were studied by atomic force microscopy. The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels disappeared in the classical 2D height image. By detailed analysis of Force Volume data the extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure of the nanogels was resolved.







Abstract
The softness of nanohydrogels results in unique properties and recently attracted tremendous interest due to the multi&#8208;functionalization of interfaces. Herein, we study extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;linked (ULC) nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels seem to disappear in classical imaging modes since a sharp tip fully penetrates these porous networks with very low forces in the range of steric interactions (ca.&#8197;100&#8197;pN). However, the detailed evaluation of Force Volume mode measurements allows us to resolve their overall shape and at the same time their internal structure in all three dimensions. The nanogels exhibit an extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure&#8212;even softer than polymer brushes. Moreover, the temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels can be switched on demand between the ultra&#8208;soft and a very stiff state.

C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds have been converted to cyano derivatives under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free condition in the presence of visible light and an organic dye. Potential applications of this method in the late&#8208;stage transformation of complex drug molecules, steroid derivatives, and gram&#8208;scale reactions have been described.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to value&#8208;added products is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. We report the use of the commercially available organic dye 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPP) for the conversion of methylarenes to the corresponding aryl nitriles via a photocatalytic process. Applying this methodology, a variety of cyanobenzenes have been synthesized in good to excellent yield under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free conditions. We demonstrate the scope of the method with over 50 examples including late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules (celecoxib) and complex structures such as l&#8208;menthol, amino acids, and cholesterol derivatives. Furthermore, the presented synthetic protocol is applicable for gram&#8208;scale reactions. In addition to methylarenes, selected examples for the cyanation of aldehydes, alcohols and oximes are demonstrated as well. Detailed mechanistic investigations have been carried out using time&#8208;resolved luminescence quenching studies, control experiments, and NMR spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies, all supporting the proposed catalytic cycle.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Polymers from d&#8208;Xylose: Living Cascade Polymerization, Tunable Degradation, and Small Molecule Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable sugar&#8208;based polymers are prepared with cascade metathesis polymerizations in a controlled and living manner. The resulting polymers are fully degradable and degradation profiles can be modified by using different monomer linkers. Polymers can also be designed such that their degradation products undergo secondary reactions to release small molecules.







Abstract
Enyne monomers derived from D&#8208;xylose underwent living cascade polymerizations to prepare new polymers with a ring&#8208;opened sugar and degradable linkage incorporated into every repeat unit of the backbone. Polymerizations were well&#8208;controlled and had living character, which enabled the preparation of high molecular weight polymers with narrow molecular weight dispersity values and a block copolymer. By tuning the type of acid&#8208;sensitive linkage (hemi&#8208;aminal ether, acetal, or ether functional groups), we could change the degradation profile of the polymer and the identity of the resulting degradation products. For instance, the large difference in degradation rates between hemi&#8208;aminal ether and ether&#8208;based polymers enabled the sequential degradation of a block copolymer. Furthermore, we exploited the generation of furan&#8208;based degradation products, from an acetal&#8208;based polymer, to achieve the release of covalently bound reporter molecules upon degradation.

         <title>Enantioselective, Visible Light Mediated Aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi Reactions of Quinoxalinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azetidines can be enantioselectively prepared from the title compounds and various 1&#8208;arylethenes. An intramolecular variant of the reaction is also possible, and the lactam ring of the products 1 can be readily cleaved without loss of enantiopurity.







Abstract
3&#8208;Substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and various aryl&#8208;substituted or tethered olefins underwent an enantioselective, inter&#8208; or intramolecular aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral sensitizer (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%). For the intermolecular reaction with 1&#8208;arylethenes as olefin components, the scope of the reaction was studied (14 examples, 50&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 86&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The absolute and relative configuration of the products were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.

         <title>A Diarylacetonitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State through a Radical Chain&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent molecular probe that functions as a scavenger of polymeric mechanoradicals was developed (see picture), and its fluorescence intensity was found to increase with increasing generation of radicals in the bulk. This probe enables the optical visualization and quantitative evaluation of polymeric radicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission of polymers that do not contain mechanophores.







Abstract
Since the beginning of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited owing to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using a diarylacetonitrile compound as a fluorescent molecular probe through this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.

         <title>Chemoselective C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;Bond Activation of the Most Stable Ring in Biphenylene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemoselective cleavage of an arene ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. The reaction proceeds with complete integrity of the central four&#8208;membered ring despite this ring containing the weakest C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond in the hydrocarbon scaffold.







Abstract
The chemoselective cleavage of a six&#8208;membered aromatic ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. This type of selectivity is unprecedented. In every example of transition metal mediated C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation reported to date, the reaction occurs at the central four&#8208;membered ring of biphenylene. Insight into the origin of chemoselectivity was obtained through a detailed mechanistic analysis (isolation of an intermediate, DFT studies, activation strain analysis). In conclusion, the divergent reactivity can be attributed to differences in both the symmetry and radial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals of the aluminum(I) fragment compared to that of common transition metal fragments.

         <title>A General Strategy to Design Highly Fluorogenic Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palette of highly fluorogenic Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes are turned on by a tetrazine bioorthogonal reaction. The emission wavelengths are fine&#8208;tuned from the far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared. These highly stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.







Abstract
Highly fluorogenic tetrazine bioorthogonal probes emitting at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths are in strong demand for biomedical imaging applications. Herein, we have developed a strategy for forming a palette of novel Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes in situ, whose fluorescence increases hundreds of times upon forming the bioorthogonal reaction product, pyridazine. The resulting probes show large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Manipulating the conjugate length and pull&#8211;push strength in the fluorophore skeleton allows the emission wavelength to be fine&#8208;tuned from 556 to 728&#8197;nm. The highly photo&#8208;stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.

Manipulating the conjugate length and pull&#8211;push strength in the fluorophore skeleton allows the emission wavelength to be fine&#8208;tuned from 556 to 728&#8197;nm. The highly photo&#8208;stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boranyl&#8208;Functionalized [Ge9] Clusters: Providing the Idea of Intramolecular Ge/B Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon reaction of silylated [Ge9] clusters with 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines boranyl&#8208;functionalization is achieved. The presented experiments aim for the generation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs as predicted from quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.







Abstract
The unique three&#8208;dimensional structure of spherical, homoatomic nine&#8208;atom germanium clusters opens various possibilities for the spatial arrangement of functional groups. Ligands comprising lone pairs have recently been introduced in the cluster sphere, and we now report the addition of a boranyl group to the cluster featuring a Ge&#8722;B exo&#8208;cluster bond. The reaction of the twofold&#8208;silylated cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; (TMS=trimethylsilyl) with 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines DABR&#8208;Cl leads to the first boranyl&#8208;functionalized [Ge9] clusters [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2DABR]&#8722; (R=methyl (1&#8201;a), iso&#8208;propyl (2&#8201;a), ortho&#8208;tolyl (3&#8201;a)). The anions 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were structurally characterized as [NHCDippCu]+ complexes (NHCDipp=1,3&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidine) through single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations manifest the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character of the boranyl&#8208;functionalized cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2BCy2]&#8722; (4&#8201;a).

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Conjugation and H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly: Key Features for Efficient Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescent Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed metal&#8208;free chromophores capable of H&#8208;bonded directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and &#963;&#8208;conjugation allow building molecular crystals exhibiting outstanding long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence. Single crystal analysis reveals a columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding. From this, guidelines for obtaining efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescent molecular crystals are established.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. Persistent luminescence depends on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and their molecular packing. Here, a strategy is developed by designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridge on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20&#8201;% and lifetimes up to 520&#8197;ms. The crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into 2D rectangular columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Torpedo&#8208;Like Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles for Autofluorescence&#8208;Free Biosensing and High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniformly torpedo&#8208;shaped green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4: Mn2+, Pr3+ nanoparticles with good persistent luminescence performance were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence of ZGMP was found and explored for autofluorescence&#8208;free biosensing and high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) with intrinsic stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are desirable because of no autofluorescence background and natural responsive luminescence. However, the stimuli&#8208;responsive features of pure PLNPs have been unexplored. Here we show a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis of green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4:Mn2+,Pr3+ nanoparticles (ZGMP) with regular shape, uniform size and good afterglow luminescent performance. We also report the pH stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent behavior of ZGMP and its possible mechanism. Taking the intriguing feature of pH responsive persistent luminescence, we explore ZGMP as autofluorescence&#8208;free probes to achieve stimuli&#8208;activated signal switch for biosensing by integrating enzyme catalysis reaction mediated pH modulation. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence also makes ZGMP promising for high&#8208;level information encryption.

         <title>Radical Carbonyl Propargylation by Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the radical three&#8208;component carbonyl propargylation between 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes, and suitable radical precursors through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis is reported for the first time. This redox&#8208;neutral reaction occurs under very mild conditions, shows high functional group tolerance and represents a complementary novel approach for preparing valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.







Abstract
Carbonyl propargylation has been established as a valuable tool in the realm of carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming reactions. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety has been recognized as an alternative pronucleophile in the above transformation through an ionic mechanism. Herein, we report for the first time, the radical carbonyl propargylation through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis. A library of valuable homopropargylic alcohols bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers could be obtained by a catalytic radical three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes and suitable radical precursors (41 examples). This redox&#8208;neutral multi&#8208;component reaction occurs under very mild conditions and shows high functional group tolerance. Remarkably, bench&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive CrCl3 could be employed as a chromium source. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, which offers a complementary and novel approach towards the preparation of valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.

         <title>Interaction of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein with Phospholipids and the Associated Restructuring of Interfacial Lipid Water: An Interface&#8208;Selective Vibrational Spectroscopic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22731-22737, December 7, 2020. </description>

Probed herein is the interaction of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;S; shown in yellow) with membrane&#8208;mimicking lipid monolayer/water interfaces. &#945;S affects the pristine air/water and charged lipid/water interfaces by perturbing the structure and orientation of the interfacial water. The net negative &#945;S reorients the water as &#8220;H&#8208;UP&#8221; at the air/water interface and electrostatically interacts with positively charged lipids. &#945;S also interacts with negatively charged lipids upon a change in the orientation of the water.







Abstract
Interaction of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;S) with biological lipids is crucial for the onset of its fibrillation at the cell membrane/water interface. Probed herein is the interaction of &#945;S with membrane&#8208;mimicking lipid monolayer/water interfaces. The results depict that &#945;S interacts negligibly with zwitterionic lipids, but strongly affects the pristine air/water and charged lipid/water interfaces by perturbing the structure and orientation of the interfacial water. The net negative &#945;S (&#8722;9 in bulk water; pH&#8197;7.4) reorients the water as hydrogen&#8208;up (H&#8208;up) at the air/water interface, and electrostatically interacts with positively charged lipids, making the interface nearly net neutral. &#945;S also interacts with negatively charged lipids: the net H&#8208;up orientation of the interfacial water decreases at the anionic lipid/water interface, revealing a domain&#8208;specific interaction of net negative &#945;S with the negatively charged lipids at the membrane surface.

         <title>Unravelling Structural Dynamics within a Photoswitchable Single Peptide: A Step Towards Multimodal Bioinspired Nanodevices</title>

Reported is a single&#8208;molecule junction containing a single peptide with an azobenzene photoswitch to interconvert between the trans (left) and cis (right) configurations upon photoisomerization using UV and visible light. Real&#8208;time electrical measurements revealed multimodal conductance states within each isomer, providing insights into the structural dynamics, and demonstrated the capacity to modulate conductance for bioinspired electronic nanodevices.







Abstract
The majority of the protein structures have been elucidated under equilibrium conditions. The aim herein is to provide a better understanding of the dynamic behavior inherent to proteins by fabricating a label&#8208;free nanodevice comprising a single&#8208;peptide junction to measure real&#8208;time conductance, from which their structural dynamic behavior can be inferred. This device contains an azobenzene photoswitch for interconversion between a well&#8208;defined cis, and disordered trans isomer. Real&#8208;time conductance measurements revealed three distinct states for each isomer, with molecular dynamics simulations showing each state corresponds to a specific range of hydrogen bond lengths within the cis isomer, and specific dihedral angles in the trans isomer. These insights into the structural dynamic behavior of peptides may rationally extend to proteins. Also demonstrated is the capacity to modulate conductance which advances the design and development of bioinspired electronic nanodevices.

         <title>Dihydrogen Adduct (Co&#8211;H2) Complexes Displaying H&#8208;Atom and Hydride Transfer</title>

Isostructural Co&#8211;H2 adducts are stabilized as highly unusual neutral S=
 and anionic S=0 species. The atypical reactivity of these complexes is described, specifically their propensity for accessing H&#8208;atom and hydride transfer.







Abstract
The prototypical reactivity profiles of transition metal dihydrogen complexes (M&#8208;H2) are well&#8208;characterized with respect to oxidative addition (to afford dihydrides, M(H)2) and as acids, heterolytically delivering H+ to a base and H&#8722; to the metal. In the course of this study we explored plausible alternative pathways for H2 activation, namely direct activation through H&#8208;atom or hydride transfer from the &#963;&#8208;H2 adducts. To this end, we describe herein the reactivity of an isostructural pair of a neutral S=
 and an anionic S=0 Co&#8208;H2 adduct, both supported by a trisphosphine borane ligand (P3B). The thermally stable metalloradical, (P3B)Co(H2), serves as a competent precursor for hydrogen atom transfer to tBu3ArO&#8901;. What is more, its anionic derivative, the dihydrogen complex [(P3B)Co(H2)]1&#8722;, is a competent precursor for hydride transfer to BEt3, establishing its remarkable hydricity. The latter finding is essentially without precedent among the vast number of M&#8208;H2 complexes known.

         <title>Deoxygenative Fluorination of Phosphine Oxides: A General Route to Fluorinated Organophosphorus(V) Compounds and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22790-22795, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, deoxygenative fluorination approach was developed using only oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride to access a broad variety of fluorinated phosphorus(V) compounds in neutral, cationic, or anionic forms. The method circumvents working with both pyrophoric starting materials and hazardous fluorinating reagents, making fluorinated group 15 heteroatoms in organic frameworks more accessible.







Abstract
Fluorinated organophosphorus(V) compounds are a very versatile class of compounds, but the synthetic methods available to make them bear the disadvantages of 1)&#8197;occasional handling of toxic or pyrophoric PIII starting materials and 2)&#8197;a dependence on hazardous fluorinating reagents such as XeF2. Herein, we present a simple solution and introduce a deoxygenative fluorination (DOF) approach that utilizes easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle phosphine oxides as starting materials and effectively replaces harsh fluorinating reagents by a combination of oxalyl chloride and potassium fluoride. The reaction has proven to be general, as R3PF2, R2PF3, and RPF4 compounds (as well as various cations and anions derived from these) are accessible in good yields and on up to a multi&#8208;gram scale. DFT calculations were used to bolster our observations. Notably, the discovery of this new method led to a convenient synthesis of 1)&#8197;new difluorophosphonium ions, 2)&#8197;hexafluorophosphate salts, and 3)&#8197;fluorinated antimony&#8208; and arsenic&#8208; compounds.

         <title>Towards a Single Chemical Model for Understanding Lanthanide Hexaborides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22684-22689, December 7, 2020. </description>

Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have a plethora of seemingly mutually incompatible properties. We propose a chemical bonding model that rationalizes the entire LnB6 series. The boron atoms can access different bonding states with the Ln, and in some LnB6 switch between them through phonon motion. The new paradigm allows predictions of new properties of mixed alloys.







Abstract
Lanthanide hexaborides (LnB6) have disparate and often anomalous properties, from structurally homogeneous mixed valency, to superconductivity, spectral anomalies, and unexplained phase transitions. It is unclear how such a diversity of properties may arise in the solids of identical crystal structures and seemingly very similar electronic structures. Building on our previous model for SmB6 (mixed valent, with a peak in specific heat, and pressure induced magnetic phase transitions), we present a unifying dynamic bonding model for LnB6 that explains simultaneously EuB6 (possessing an anomalous peak in specific heat at low T, magnetic phase transitions, and no mixed valency), YbB6 (mixed valent topological insulator), and rather ordinary LaB6. We show that Ln can engage in covalent bonding with boron, and, in some members of the LnB6 family, also easily access alternative bonding states through the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The accessibility, relative energetics, and bonding nature of the states involved dictate the properties.

We show that Ln can engage in covalent bonding with boron, and, in some members of the LnB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family, also easily access alternative bonding states through the electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The accessibility, relative energetics, and bonding nature of the states involved dictate the properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Colyliform Crystalline 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) with Quasi&#8208;3D Topologies for Rapid I2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22697-22705, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of COF has colyliform quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; oblique triangular pores, and larger interlayer spacings. The Q&#8208;3D structure improves the permeability and mass transfer rate giving a faster adsorption rate for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, and an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural characteristics on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a good approach to effectively improve the permeability and mass transfer rate of the materials and realize the rapid adsorption for guest molecules, while avoiding the high cost and monomer scarcity in preparing 3D COFs. Herein, we report for the first time a series of colyliform crystalline 2D COFs with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;3D) topologies, consisting of unique &#8220;stereoscopic&#8221; triangular pores, large interlayer spacings and flexible constitutional units which makes the pores elastic and self&#8208;adaptable for the guest transmission. The as&#8208;prepared QTD&#8208;COFs have a faster adsorption rate (2.51&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1) for iodine than traditional 2D COFs, with an unprecedented maximum adsorption capacity of 6.29&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1. The excellent adsorption performance, as well as the prominent irradiation stability allow the QTD&#8208;COFs to be applied for the rapid removal of radioactive iodine.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;C Oxidative Coupling Reactions Photocatalyzed by Zwitterionic Ligand Capped CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

C&#8722;C oxidative dimerizations of &#945;&#8208;aryl ketonitriles are realized by using zwitterionic ligand capped CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs as catalysts under visible light illumination, via a radical mediated reaction pathway. High stereoselectivities of dl&#8208;isomers were obtained owing to less steric hindrance during the bond formation process. Our study sheds new lights on using lead&#8208;halide perovskite QDs as photocatalysts for stereoselective organic synthesis.







Abstract
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of photocatalysis, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties for photocatalytic reactions, including high absorption coefficients and long photogenerated carrier lifetimes. Herein, by choosing 2&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;oxobutanenitrile as a model substrate, we demonstrate that the stereoselective (&gt;99&#8201;%) C&#8722;C oxidative coupling reaction can be realized with a high product yield (99&#8201;%) using zwitterionic ligand capped CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs under visible light illumination. The reaction can be generalized to different starting materials with various substituents on the phenyl ring and varied functional moieties, producing stereoselective dl&#8208;isomers. A radical mediated reaction pathway has been proposed. Our study provides a new way of stereoselective C&#8722;C oxidative coupling via a photocatalytic means using specially designed perovskite QDs.

         <title>TTF&#8208;Annulated Silicon Phthalocyanine Oligomers and Their External&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Orientational Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22721-22730, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
External&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive orientational ordering was achieved based on the rotational isomerism of &#956;&#8208;oxo silicon phthalocyanine oligomers and intermolecular interaction of tetrathiafulvalene. The stable performance of oligomers as a lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode compared with monomer ensures potential use of one&#8208;dimensionally stacked oligomer structures toward creation of artificial molecular systems for energy/electron harvesting and transfer.







Abstract
Orientational control of functional molecules is essential to create complex functionalities as seen in nature; however, such artificial systems have remained challenge. Herein, we have succeeded in controlling rotational isomerism of &#956;&#8208;oxo silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) oligomers to achieve an external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive orientational ordering using intermolecular interactions of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). In this system, three modes of orientations, free rotation, eclipsed conformation, and staggered conformation, were interconverted in response to the oxidation states of TTF, which varied interactions from association due to formation of mixed&#8208;valence TTF dimer to dissociation due to electrostatic repulsion between TTF dications. Furthermore, a stable performance of oligomers as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;ion battery proved that the one&#8208;dimensionally stacked, rotatable structure of SiPc oligomers is useful to control the orientation of functional molecules toward molecular electronics.

         <title>Expedient Synthetic Identification of a P&#8208;Stereogenic Ligand Motif for the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Isotactic Polar Polypropylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22591-22601, December 7, 2020. </description>

Preparation of functionalized isotactic polypropylenes is hampered by the absence of good tacticity&#8208;inducing ligand motifs for group 10 catalysts. Only a natural&#8208;product&#8208;derived dimenthylphosphine is known. Accelerating ligand and Pd complex syntheses led to a P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinite motif that allowed propylene copolymerization with unprecedented mms up to 0.75 for group 10 catalysts at an industrially relevant temperature of 50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The iso&#8208;specific statistical copolymerization of unprotected polar monomers with propylene remains a grand challenge in the field of polymer chemistry. Current research is hampered because only a single natural&#8208;product&#8208;derived dimenthylphosphine&#8208;motif is known to allow for the preparation of moderately isotactic polypropylene copolymers. To overcome this structural limitation, we developed time&#8208;efficient synthetic methods that facilitate P&#8208;donor ligand development. The strength of these methods was demonstrated with preparation of twenty&#8208;five new P&#8208;stereogenic phosphine/sulfonate&#8208; and bisphosphine&#8208;monoxide&#8208;type palladium catalysts, which could typically be developed in parallel. A lead candidate was identified for iso&#8208;specific propylene polymerization. The best&#8208;performing catalysts utilizing the P&#8208;stereogenic donor motif achieved triad isotacticities of up to mm=0.75&#8212;the highest value within those reported for group 10 metal catalysts&#8212;for the homo&#8208; and copolymerization of propylene with unprotected polar monomers at an industrially relevant temperature of 50&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Manipulating Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Macro&#8208;Movement and Static Photonic Properties within 1D Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22623-22630, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 1D isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular cocrystals have light&#8208;induced dynamic movement and static photonic properties, which can be attributed to the alternations of the geometric orientation of photoactive molecules and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes within the co&#8208;assembled units.







Abstract
Smart molecular crystals with light&#8208;driven mechanical responses have received interest owing to their potential uses in molecular machines, artificial muscles, and biomimetics. However, challenges remain in control over both the dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors and static photonic properties of molecular crystals based on the same molecule. Herein, we show the construction of isostructural co&#8208;crystals allows their light&#8208;induced cracking and jumping behaviors (photosalient effect) to be controlled. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals from 4&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthylvinyl)pyridine (NVP) with co&#8208;formers (tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (THA) and tetrafluorobenzoic acid (TA)) crystallize as isostructural crystals, but have different static and dynamic photo&#8208;mechanical behaviors. These differences are due to alternations in the orientation of NVP and hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes of the co&#8208;formers. After light activation, the 1D NVP&#8208;TA crystal splits and shears off within 1&#8197;s. For NVP&#8208;THA, its photostability and high quantum yield give novel photonic properties, including low optical waveguide loss, highly polarized anisotropy, and efficient up&#8208;conversion fluorescence.

Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept inorganic probes that exploit a novel mechanism for 19F magnetic resonance sensing based on converting from low&#8208;spin (S=0) to high&#8208;spin (S=1) Ni2+ are reported. Activation of diamagnetic NiL1 and NiL2 by light or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, respectively, converts them into paramagnetic NiL0, which displays a single 19F&#8197;NMR peak shifted by &gt;35&#8197;ppm. This spin&#8208;state switch is effective for sensing light or enzyme expression in live cells.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly and Chirality of Synthetic Carbohydrate Materials</title>

Synthetic oligosaccharides and microED analysis enable the molecular level characterization of carbohydrate materials. The local crystal organization is correlated to the supramolecular architecture, allowing for the design of helical structures as well as flat lamellae.







Abstract
Hierarchical carbohydrate architectures serve multiple roles in nature. Hardly any correlations between the carbohydrate chemical structures and the material properties are available due to the lack of standards and suitable analytic techniques. Therefore, designer carbohydrate materials remain highly unexplored, as compared to peptides and nucleic acids. A synthetic D&#8208;glucose disaccharide, DD, was chosen as a model to explore carbohydrate materials. Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), optimized for oligosaccharides, revealed that DD assembled into highly crystalline left&#8208;handed helical fibers. The supramolecular architecture was correlated to the local crystal organization, allowing for the design of the enantiomeric right&#8208;handed fibers, based on the L&#8208;glucose disaccharide, LL, or flat lamellae, based on the racemic mixture. Tunable morphologies and mechanical properties suggest the potential of carbohydrate materials for nanotechnology applications.

         <title>Removing Formaldehyde&#8208;Induced Peptidyl Crosslinks Enables Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Peptide Hormone Distributions from Formalin&#8208;Fixed Paraffin&#8208;Embedded Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22584-22590, December 7, 2020. </description>

The preservation of biological samples in formaldehyde induces intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;crosslinking of peptides, which hampers the mass spectrometric detection of those analytes. Chemical reversal of formaldehyde&#8208;induced peptidyl crosslinking permits mass spectrometry imaging of intact peptides, while protecting the spatiochemical characteristics of analytes in formalin&#8208;fixed paraffin&#8208;embedded tissues.







Abstract
Linking molecular and chemical changes to human disease states depends on the availability of appropriate clinical samples, mostly preserved as formalin&#8208;fixed paraffin&#8208;embedded (FFPE) specimens stored in tissue banks. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the visualization of the spatiotemporal distribution of molecules in biological samples. However, MSI is not effective for imaging FFPE tissues because of the chemical modifications of analytes, including complex crosslinking between nucleophilic moieties. Here we used an MS&#8208;compatible inorganic nucleophile, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to chemically reverse inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crosslinks from endogenous molecules. The analyte restoration appears specific for formaldehyde&#8208;reactive amino acids. This approach enabled the MSI&#8208;assisted localization of pancreatic peptides expressed in the alpha, beta, and gamma cells. Pancreatic islet&#8208;like distributions of islet hormones were observed in human FFPE tissues preserved for more than five years, demonstrating that samples from biobanks can effectively be investigated with MSI.

         <title>A Surface&#8208;Strained and Geometry&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactor that Promotes Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22610-22616, December 7, 2020. </description>

A surface&#8208;strained and geometry&#8208;optimized TiO2 nanoreactor was designed to enhance the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction. The nanotubular structure enables spatial confinement to regulate mass transfer during NRR process, thus boosting ammonia production with high selectivity. The tensile strain induced by Li+ intercalation/deintercalation favors N2 adsorption, thereby achieving a faster kinetic rate.







Abstract
A surface&#8208;strained and geometry&#8208;optimized TiO2 nanoreactor enhances the performance of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The nanotubular confinement allows spatial regulation of the mass transport of nitrogen during the NRR process and offers an enlarged surface area, thus boosting the ammonia production with high selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support strained Ti3+ sites, demonstrating a more favorable pathway for the N2 activation and selective NH3 production with a faster kinetic rate than the pristine TiO2. The TiO2&#8208;based nanoreactor with surface and bulk structure tailoring delivered an NH3 yield rate up to 5.50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (16.67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) and high faradaic efficiency of 26&#8201;% under ambient aqueous conditions. Our findings highlight the concept of lattice strain and geometry modified nanoreactors, which will have broad implications in the renewable energy catalysis and electrosynthesis of valuable products.

The tensile strain induced by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/deintercalation favors N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, thereby achieving a faster kinetic rate.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surface&#8208;strained and geometry&#8208;optimized TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoreactor enhances the performance of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The nanotubular confinement allows spatial regulation of the mass transport of nitrogen during the NRR process and offers an enlarged surface area, thus boosting the ammonia production with high selectivity. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support strained Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, demonstrating a more favorable pathway for the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and selective NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production with a faster kinetic rate than the pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based nanoreactor with surface and bulk structure tailoring delivered an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate up to 5.50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16.67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high faradaic efficiency of 26&#8201;% under ambient aqueous conditions. Our findings highlight the concept of lattice strain and geometry modified nanoreactors, which will have broad implications in the renewable energy catalysis and electrosynthesis of valuable products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cross&#8208;Module Enoylreduction in the Azalomycin&#8197;F Polyketide Synthase</title>

A switchable enoylreductase (ER) domain borrowed by neighboring module in macrolide antibiotic Azlomycin&#8197;F biosynthesis shows modular polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8217;s versatility that was previously unknown. This internal ER domain not only serves as an unusual switch in an iterative module for enoylreduction but also functions surprisingly in a cross&#8208;module mode during polyketide chain elongation. This discovery further expands our understanding of the wonderful nature of PKS.







Abstract
The colinearity of canonical modular polyketide synthases, which creates a direct link between multienzyme structure and the chemical structure of the biosynthetic end&#8208;product, has become a cornerstone of knowledge&#8208;based genome mining. Herein, we report genetic and enzymatic evidence for the remarkable role of an enoylreductase in the polyketide synthase for azalomycin F biosynthesis. This internal enoylreductase domain, previously identified as acting only in the second of two chain extension cycles on an initial iterative module, is shown to also catalyze enoylreduction in trans within the next module. The mechanism for this rare deviation from colinearity appears to involve direct cross&#8208;modular interaction of the reductase with the longer acyl chain, rather than back transfer of the substrate into the iterative module, suggesting an additional and surprising plasticity in natural PKS assembly&#8208;line catalysis.

         <title>Incorporating Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides Into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22749-22755, December 7, 2020. </description>

Monodisperse, small&#8208;size, and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts of transition&#8208;metal phosphides, such as Ni2P and Ni12P5, have been incorporated into metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies demonstrate that Pt as a cocatalyst is thermodynamically favorable, yet Ni2P is kinetically preferred in photocatalytic H2 production. Taking all factors into account, Ni2P exhibits an even better photocatalytic H2&#8208;production activity than Pt.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress electron&#8211;hole recombination, a Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H2 production, which greatly limits practical application. Herein, for the first time, monodisperse, small&#8208;size, and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free transitional&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs; for example, Ni2P, Ni12P5), are incorporated into a representative MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, for photocatalytic H2 production. Compared with the parent MOF and their physical mixture, both TMPs@MOF composites display significantly improved H2 production rates. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal that TMPs, behaving similar ability to Pt, greatly accelerate the linker&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer, promote charge separation, and reduce the activation energy of H2 production. Significantly, the results indicate that Pt is thermodynamically favorable, yet Ni2P is kinetically preferred for H2 production, accounting for the higher activity of Ni2P@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 than Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2.

         <title>Tuning Gate&#8208;Opening of a Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Ternary Gas Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22756-22762, December 7, 2020. </description>

One&#8208;step sieving separation of a ternary gas mixture (C2H2/CO2/C2H4) has been realized by a flexible MOF NTU&#8208;65. Successful separation relies on tuning the gate&#8208;opening pressure of this flexible framework to optimize the separation performance. Under an optimized temperature, NTU&#8208;65 adsorbed large amount of C2H2 and CO2 but a negligible amount of C2H4, readily producing high&#8208;purity C2H4 through a separation column.







Abstract
In comparison with the fast development of binary mixture separations, ternary mixture separations are significantly more difficult and have rarely been realized by a single material. Herein, a new strategy of tuning the gate&#8208;opening pressure of flexible MOFs is developed to tackle such a challenge. As demonstrated by a flexible framework NTU&#8208;65, the gate&#8208;opening pressure of ethylene (C2H4), acetylene (C2H2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be regulated by temperature. Therefore, efficient sieving separation of this ternary mixture was realized. Under optimized temperature, NTU&#8208;65 adsorbed a large amount of C2H2 and CO2 through gate&#8208;opening and only negligible amount of C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated that this material can simultaneously capture C2H2 and CO2, yielding polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.99&#8201;%) C2H4 from single breakthrough separation.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Pro&#8208;Protein Therapy Assisted by a Self&#8208;Catalyzed Nanozymogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22544-22553, December 7, 2020. </description>

A hypoxia&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;protein and glucose oxidase (GOx) were encapsulated within hypoxia&#8208;dissociable nanocomplexes (NCs) to achieve tumor&#8208;specific, therapeutic pro&#8208;protein delivery and activation. Upon GOx&#8208;catalyzed hypoxia aggravation, cascaded intracellular pro&#8208;protein activation, NC dissociation, and protein release were self&#8208;catalyzed and self&#8208;cycled, resulting in efficient and selective anti&#8208;cancer therapy.







Abstract
The success of intracellular protein therapy demands efficient delivery and selective protein activity in diseased cells. Therefore, a cascaded nanozymogen consisting of a hypoxia&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;protein, a hypoxia&#8208;inducing protein, and a hypoxia&#8208;strengthened intracellular protein delivery nanovehicle was developed. RPAB, an enzymatically inactive pro&#8208;protein of RNase, reversibly caged with hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azobenzene, was delivered with glucose oxidase (GOx) using hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomplexes (NCs) consisting of azobenzene&#8208;cross&#8208;linked oligoethylenimine (AOEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon NC&#8208;mediated delivery into cancer cells, GOx catalyzed glucose decomposition and aggravated tumoral hypoxia, which drove the recovery of RPAB back to the hydrolytically active RNase and expedited the degradation of AOEI to release more protein cargoes. Thus, the catalytic reaction of the nanozymogen was self&#8208;accelerated and self&#8208;cycled, ultimately leading to a cooperative anti&#8208;cancer effect between GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy and RNase&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;apoptotic therapy.

Therefore, a cascaded nanozymogen consisting of a hypoxia&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;protein, a hypoxia&#8208;inducing protein, and a hypoxia&#8208;strengthened intracellular protein delivery nanovehicle was developed. RPAB, an enzymatically inactive pro&#8208;protein of RNase, reversibly caged with hypoxia&#8208;cleavable azobenzene, was delivered with glucose oxidase (GOx) using hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomplexes (NCs) consisting of azobenzene&#8208;cross&#8208;linked oligoethylenimine (AOEI) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon NC&#8208;mediated delivery into cancer cells, GOx catalyzed glucose decomposition and aggravated tumoral hypoxia, which drove the recovery of RPAB back to the hydrolytically active RNase and expedited the degradation of AOEI to release more protein cargoes. Thus, the catalytic reaction of the nanozymogen was self&#8208;accelerated and self&#8208;cycled, ultimately leading to a cooperative anti&#8208;cancer effect between GOx&#8208;mediated starvation therapy and RNase&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;apoptotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Bio&#8208;Barcode Assay Enables Electrochemical Detection of a Cancer Biomarker in Undiluted Human Plasma: A Sample&#8208;In&#8208;Answer&#8208;Out Approach</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay allows protein biomarkers to be analyzed in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma samples. The dynamic DNA/protein complexes, composed of antibody&#8208;labelled DNA motifs (TB and B*C) and redox&#8208;labelled DNA (CR*), eliminate the need for multistep processing and allow sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out analysis.







Abstract
There is a need for biosensing systems that can be operated at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) for disease screening and diagnostics and health monitoring. In spite of this, simple to operate systems with the required analytical sensitivity and specificity in clinical samples, using a sample&#8208;in&#8208;answer&#8208;out approach, remain elusive. Reported here is an electrochemical bio&#8208;barcode assay (e&#8208;biobarcode assay) that integrates biorecognition with signal transduction using molecular (DNA/protein) machines and signal readout using nanostructured electrodes. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay eliminates multistep processing and uses a single step for analysis following sample collection into the reagent tube. A clinically relevant performance for the analysis of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in undiluted and unprocessed human plasma: a log&#8208;linear range of 1&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1&#8211;200&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and a LOD of 0.4&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, was achieved. The e&#8208;biobarcode assay offers a realistic solution for biomarker analysis at the POC.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Cationic Phospholes: Synthesis and Applications as Ancillary Ligands</title>

A series of &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphole ligands has been synthesized and their use as ancillary ligands explored in Au&#8208;catalysis. If compared with non&#8208;heterocyclic &#945;&#8208;cationic phospines, higher reaction rates and better control of the stereoselectivity are obtained.







Abstract
A series of structurally differentiated &#945;&#8208;cationic phospholes containing cyclopropenium, imidazolium, and iminium substituents has been synthesized by reaction of chlorophosphole 1 with the corresponding stable carbenes. Evaluation of the donor properties of these compounds reveals that their strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character is heavily influenced by the nature of the cationic group. The coordination chemistry of these newly prepared ligands towards AuI centers is also described and their unique electronic properties exploited in catalysis. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphole containing catalysts were not only able to accelerate model cycloisomerization reactions, but also to efficiently discriminate between concurrent reaction pathways, avoiding the formation of undesired product mixtures.

         <title>Highly Conducting Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Copper Sulfides CuxC6S6 (x=4 or 5.5): Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation&#8208;Induced Chemical and Electronic Structure Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22602-22609, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of electrically conductive coordination polymers (CuxC6S6; x=3, 4 or 5.5) are reported. The hybrid structures of the polymers offer charge&#8208;transport paths and enable a shift of the Fermi level by modulating the oxidation level of the non&#8208;innocent redox&#8208;active ligand. As a result, their band structures range from metal to degenerate semiconductors in which Cu5.5C6S6 demonstrates appreciable thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
Conductive coordination polymers (CPs) have potential in a wide range of applications because of their inherent structural and functional diversity. Three electrically conductive CPs (CuxC6S6, x=3, 4 or 5.5) derived from the same organic linker (benzenehexathiol) and metal node (copper(I)) were synthesized and studied. CuxC6S6 materials are organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper sulfides comprising a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking structure and cooper sulfur networks. Charge&#8208;transport pathways within the network facilitate conductivity and offer control of the Fermi level through modulation of the oxidation level of the non&#8208;innocent redox&#8208;active ligand. Two CuxC6S6 (x=4 or 5.5) CPs display high electrical conductivity and they feature a tunable structural topology and electronic structure. Cu4C6S6 and Cu5.5C6S6 act as degenerate semiconductors. Moreover, Cu5.5C6S6 is a p&#8208;type thermoelectric material with a ZT value of 0.12 at 390&#8197;K, which is a record&#8208;breaking performance for p&#8208;type CPs.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Space Structure Determination of Covalent Organic Frameworks from 3D Electron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22638-22644, December 7, 2020. </description>

The direct&#8208;space strategy for structure solution, implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA), is shown to be a successful approach for structure determination of COF&#8208;300 from low&#8208;resolution 3D electron diffraction data.







Abstract
Structure determination of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with atomic precision is a bottleneck that hinders the development of COF chemistry. Although three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D&#8208;ED) data has been used to solve structures of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized COFs, successful structure solution is not guaranteed as the data resolution is usually low. We demonstrate that the direct&#8208;space strategy for structure solution, implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA), is a successful approach for structure determination of COF&#8208;300 from 3D&#8208;ED data. Structural models with different geometric constraints were considered in the GA calculations, with successful structure solution achieved from room&#8208;temperature 3D&#8208;ED data with a resolution as low as ca. 3.78&#8197;&#197;. The generality of this strategy was further verified for different phases of COF&#8208;300. This study demonstrates a viable strategy for structure solution of COF materials from 3D&#8208;ED data of limited resolution, which may facilitate the discovery of new COF materials in the future.

         <title>Jahn&#8211;Teller Disproportionation Induced Exfoliation of Unit&#8208;Cell Scale &#1013;&#8208;MnO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22659-22666, December 7, 2020. </description>

Exfoliation of 3D perovskite at the unit cell scale of &#1013;&#8208;MnO2 is proposed. The strategy involves a proton&#8208;induced Jahn&#8211;Teller disproportionation, assisted by the removal of A&#8208;site ions, dissolution of Mn2+ and reconstruction of MnO6 octahedra.







Abstract
Exfoliation of non&#8208;layered (structurally) bulk materials at the nanoscale is challenging because of the strong chemical bonds in the lattice, as opposed to the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions in layered materials. We propose a top&#8208;down method to exfoliate &#1013;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets in a family of charge&#8208;ordered La1&#8722;xAExMnO3 (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) perovskites, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller disproportionation effect of Mn3+ and bond&#8208;strength differences. &#1013;&#8208;MnO2 crystallized into a nickel arsenide (NiAs) structure, with a thickness of 0.91&#8197;nm, displays thermal metastability and superior water oxidation activity compared to other manganese oxides. The exfoliation mechanism involves a synergistic proton&#8208;induced Mn3+ disproportionation and structural reconstruction. The synthetic method could also be potentially extended to the exfoliation of other two&#8208;dimensional nanosheet materials with non&#8208;layered structures.

         <title>High Ammonia Uptake of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Adsorbent in a Wide Pressure Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22531-22536, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework adsorbent with open metal sites is presented. It has record high capacities over a wide range of NH3 concentrations as well as an exceptional stability upon exposure to wet NH3.







Abstract
Although numerous porous adsorbents have been investigated for NH3 capture applications, these materials often exhibit insufficient NH3 uptake, low NH3 affinity at the ppm level, and poor chemical stability against wet NH3 conditions. The NH3 capture properties of M2(dobpdc) complexes (M=Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+; dobpdc4&#8722;=4,4&#8208;dioxidobiphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarboxylate) that contain open metal sites is presented. The NH3 uptake of Mg2(dobpdc) at 298&#8197;K was 23.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 8.25&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 570&#8197;ppm, which are record high capacities at both pressures among existing porous adsorbents. The structural stability of Mg2(dobpdc) upon exposure to wet NH3 was superior to that of the other M2(dobpdc) and the frameworks tested. Overall, these results demonstrate that Mg2(dobpdc) is a recyclable compound that exhibits significant NH3 affinity and capacity, making it a promising candidate for real&#8208;world NH3&#8208;capture applications.

         <title>Coupled Vacancy Pairs in Ni&#8208;Doped CoSe for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production Through Topochemical Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22743-22748, December 7, 2020. </description>

The HER activity of CoSe is considerably improved by engineering the Co vacancies through Ni doping. A low overpotential of 185.7&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is observed, which can be attributed to the upshift of sp orbitals.







Abstract
Vacancy engineering plays vital role in the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Here, we introduced coupled cation&#8208;vacancy pairs in Ni&#8208;doped CoSe to achieve boosted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity through a facile topochemical intercalation approach. Adjacent Co vacancy pairs and heteroatom Ni doping contribute together for the upshift of the Se 4pz orbital, which induces larger overlap between the Se&#8197;4p and H&#8197;1s orbitals. As a result, the free energy of H adsorption can be lowered significantly. With an advanced HER activity of 185.7&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, this work provides new direction and guidance for the design of novel electrocatalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Fiber&#8208;Powered Microsensor for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing with High Neuronal Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22652-22658, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microsensor powered by a single carbon fiber through spontaneous bipolar electrochemistry has been developed for in vivo neurochemical sensing (see picture). The microsensor features a good response, high spatiotemporal resolution, and high neuronal compatibility. Furthermore, it can be successfully combined with an electrophysiological recording system, thus enabling synchronous recording of neurochemical dynamics and single&#8208;unit activities.







Abstract
The development of new principles and techniques with high neuronal compatibility for quantitatively monitoring the dynamics of neurochemicals is essential for deciphering brain chemistry and function but remains a great challenge. We herein report a neuron&#8208;compatible method for in vivo neurochemical sensing by powering a single carbon fiber through spontaneous bipolar electrochemistry as a new sensing platform. By using ascorbic acid as a model target to prove the concept, we found that the single&#8208;carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;powered microsensor exhibited a good response, high stability and, more importantly, excellent neuronal compatibility. The microsensor was also highly compatible with electrophysiological recording, thus enabling the synchronous recording of both chemical and electrical signals. The sensing principle could be developed for in vivo monitoring of various neurochemicals in the future by rationally designing and tuning the electrochemical reactions at the two poles of the carbon fiber.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cysteine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation: Biocompatible Thiol&#8211;Ene Click Chemistry</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cysteine&#8208;selective bioconjugation has been achieved using fluorescent photosensitizer QPEG and photocatalyst QCAT. By exploiting the intrinsic photosensitizing capacities of QPEG and QCAT, a fluorophore QPEG and biologically relevant groups could be installed chemo&#8208; and regioselectively into a series of complex peptides and proteins under biocompatible mild conditions.







Abstract
Bioconjugation methods using visible&#8208;light photocatalysis have emerged as powerful synthetic tools for the selective modification of biomolecules under mild reaction conditions. However, the number of photochemical transformations that allow successful protein bioconjugation is still limited because of the need for stringent reaction conditions. Herein, we report that a newly developed water&#8208;compatible fluorescent photosensitizer QPEG can be used for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cysteine&#8208;specific bioconjugation for the installation of QPEG by exploiting its intrinsic photosensitizing ability to activate the S&#8722;H bond of cysteine. The slightly modified QCAT enables the effective photocatalytic cysteine&#8208;specific conjugation of biologically relevant groups. The superior reactivity and cysteine selectivity of this methodology was further corroborated by traceless bioconjugation with a series of complex peptides and proteins under biocompatible conditions.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [4+1] and [5+1] Annulation of Arenes and 1,3&#8208;Enynes: A Distinct Mechanism of Allyl Formation and Allyl Functionalization</title>

RhIII&#8208;catalyzed [4+1] and [5+1] annulation of N&#8208;methoxy benzamides and 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones with 1,3&#8208;enynes has been realized for the enantioselective synthesis of lactams and isochromenes, respectively. DFT studies suggest an unusual pathway of alkenyl&#8208;to&#8208;allyl rearrangment and SN2&#8242;&#8208;type allylic substitution for the [4+1] annulation system.







Abstract
We report chiral RhIII cyclopentadienyl&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of lactams and isochromenes through oxidative [4+1] and [5+1] annulation, respectively, between arenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds through a C&#8722;H activation, alkenyl&#8208;to&#8208;allyl rearrangement, and a nucleophilic cyclization cascade. The mechanisms of the [4+1] annulations were elucidated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. DFT studies indicated that, following the C&#8722;H activation and alkyne insertion, a RhIII alkenyl intermediate undergoes &#948;&#8208;hydrogen elimination of the allylic C&#8722;H via a six&#8208;membered ring transition state to produce a RhIII enallene hydride intermediate. Subsequent hydride insertion and allyl rearrangement affords several rhodium(III) allyl intermediates, and a rare RhIII &#951;4 ene&#8208;allyl species with &#960;&#8208;agostic interaction undergoes SN2&#8242;&#8208;type external attack by the nitrogen nucleophile, instead of C&#8722;N reductive elimination, as the stereodetermining step.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling on Inert Surfaces by Deposition of En&#8197;Route Generated Aryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22785-22789, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terphenyl biradicals are generated from iodinated precursors en&#8197;route by deposition through the reactive drift tube of a newly devised radical deposition source. Upon deposition onto iodine&#8208;passivated metal surfaces, the terphenyl radicals self&#8208;assemble into ordered structures but remain active for C&#8722;C coupling into dimers and extended oligomers.







Abstract
To facilitate C&#8722;C coupling in on&#8208;surface synthesis on inert surfaces, we devised a radical deposition source (RDS) for the direct deposition of aryl radicals onto arbitrary substrates. Its core piece is a heated reactive drift tube through which halogenated precursors are deposited and en&#8197;route converted into radicals. For the proof of concept we study 4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;diiodo&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (DITP) precursors on iodine&#8208;passivated metal surfaces. Deposition with the RDS at room temperature results in highly regular structures comprised of mostly monomeric (terphenyl) or dimeric (sexiphenyl) biradicals. Mild heating activates progressive C&#8722;C coupling into more extended molecular wires. These structures are distinctly different from the self&#8208;assemblies observed upon conventional deposition of intact DITP. Direct deposition of radicals renders substrate reactivity unnecessary, thereby paving the road for synthesis on application&#8208;relevant inert surfaces.

         <title>Redox Dyshomeostasis Strategy for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy Based on DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Electrophilic ZIFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22537-22543, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox dyshomeostasis (RDH) strategy is proposed based on the pH/hypoxia/H2O2 triple stimuli responsive nanoplatform FeCysPW@ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz (CAT=catalase) to disrupt redox homeostasis by simultaneously increasing intracellular H2O2 and reducing glutathione (GSH). This strategy is further applied to improve chemodynamic therapy (CDT) mediated hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Redox homeostasis is one of the main reasons for reactive oxygen species (ROS) tolerance in hypoxic tumors, limiting ROS&#8208;mediated tumor therapy. Proposed herein is a redox dyshomeostasis (RDH) strategy based on a nanoplatform, FeCysPW@ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz, to disrupt redox homeostasis, and its application to improve ROS&#8208;mediated hypoxic tumor therapy. Once endocytosed by tumor cells, the catalase DNAzyme (CAT Dz) loaded zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;82 (ZIF&#8208;82@CAT Dz) shell can be degraded into Zn2+ as cofactors for CAT Dz mediated CAT silencing and electrophilic ligands for glutathione (GSH) depletion under hypoxia, both of which lead to intracellular RDH and H2O2 accumulation. These &#8220;disordered&#8221; cells show reduced resistance to ROS and are effectively killed by ferrous cysteine&#8208;phosphotungstate (FeCysPW) induced chemodynamic therapy (CDT). In vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that the pH/hypoxia/H2O2 triple stimuli responsive nanocomposite can efficiently kill hypoxic tumors. Overall, the RDH strategy provides a new way of thinking about ROS&#8208;mediated treatment of hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Raising the COx Methanation Activity of a Ru/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst by Activated Modification of Metal&#8211;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22763-22770, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial enhancement of the activity of Ru/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst for the methanation of CO2 results from an unusual modification of the metal&#8211;support interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, which causes a significant increase of support basicity and restructuring of Ru NPs from hemispherical to flat.







Abstract
Ru/Al2O3 is a highly stable, but less active catalyst for methanation reactions. Herein we report an effective approach to significantly improve its performance in the methanation of CO2/H2 mixtures. Highly active and stable Ru/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by high&#8208;temperature treatment in the reductive reaction gas. Operando/in&#8197;situ spectroscopy and STEM imaging reveals that the strongly improved activity, by factors of 5 and 14 for CO and CO2 methanation, is accompanied by a flattening of the Ru nanoparticles and the formation of highly basic hydroxylated alumina sites. We propose a modification of the metal&#8211;support interactions (MSIs) as the origin of the increased activity, caused by modification of the Al2O3 surface in the reductive atmosphere and an increased thermal mobility of the Ru nanoparticles, allowing their transfer to modified surface sites.

Piezoelectricity has been used to generate trifluoromethyl (CF3) radicals for the mechanochemical C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of aromatic compounds (see scheme). As compared to conventional solution&#8208;based approaches, this mechanoredox C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation enabled cleaner and more sustainable access to a wide range of trifluoromethylated N&#8208;heterocycles and peptides, which are important structural motifs in modern drug discovery.

         <title>Regioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heteroarene N&#8208;Oxides Enabled by a Traceless Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22675-22683, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of heteroarene N&#8208;oxides with a range of alkynes was developed by exploiting a traceless operation of a nucleophile to override the intrinsic electron deficiency of N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts. Generality was demonstrated in the regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes.







Abstract
Although N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts have been widely used as umpoled synthons with nucleophilic (hetero)arenes, the use of electron&#8208;poor heteroarenes has remained unexplored. To overcome the inherent electron deficiency of quinolinium salts, a traceless nucleophile&#8208;triggered strategy was designed, wherein the quinolinium segment is converted into a dearomatized intermediate, thereby allowing simultaneous C8&#8208;functionalization of quinolines at room temperature. Experimental and computational studies support the traceless operation of a nucleophile, which enables the previously inaccessible transformation of N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts. Remarkably, the generality of this strategy has been further demonstrated by broad applications in the regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of other electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes such as phenanthridine, isoquinoline, and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, offering a practical tool for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.

         <title>Activating Versatile Mechanoluminescence in Organic Host&#8211;Guest Crystals by Controlling Exciton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22645-22651, December 7, 2020. </description>

Versatile mechanoluminescence can be activated in organic piezophotonic host&#8211;guest crystals through controlling exciton transfer. This occurs under conditions for which neither the host nor the guest has mechanoluminescence properties.







Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials are attracting increasing interest owing to promising applications in various areas. However, to date, it remains a major challenge to develop a precise and universal route to achieving organic ML materials. Herein, we show that ML can be easily realized in organic piezophotonic host&#8211;guest crystals, under conditions in which neither the host nor the guest is ML&#8208;active. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that excitons of the host generated by piezoelectricity can be harvested effectively by the guest for light emission, owing to the restraint of intersystem crossing process. Moreover, different host&#8211;guest crystals are constructed, wherein the emission color, intensity, color purity, and emission duration of ML can be manipulated. This work deepens our understanding of organic ML generation in piezophotonic host&#8211;guest crystals and provides an inspiring principle to design more organic ML materials.

         <title>A Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor with Planar Backbone and Near&#8208;IR Absorption for High Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22714-22720, December 7, 2020. </description>

Two fully non&#8208;fused acceptors are precisely designed and easily prepared. The side chain encapsulation can induce a planar molecular backbone conformation, endowing the acceptor with broad light absorption. Thermal annealing promotes molecular rearrangement to form J&#8208;aggregates with even broader absorption and higher absorption coefficient. A PCE over 10&#8201;% is one of the highest PCE for fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors.







Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have made significant progress in recent years, while the development of fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors has been unsatisfactory. Here, two fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, o&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F and m&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F, were designed and synthesized. By regulating the location of the hexyloxy chains, o&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F formed planar backbones, while m&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F displayed a twisted backbone. Additionally, the o&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F film showed a markedly red&#8208;shifted absorption after thermal annealing, which indicated the formation of J&#8208;aggregates. For fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs), PBDB&#8208;T was used as a donor and blended with the two acceptors. The o&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F&#8208;based blend films displayed higher charge mobilities, lower energy loss and a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The optimized devices based on o&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F gave a PCE of 10.26&#8201;%, which was much higher than those based on m&#8208;4TBC&#8208;2F at 2.63&#8201;%, and it is one of the highest reported PCE values for fully non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors.

         <title>Asymmetric Transformation Driven by Confinement and Self&#8208;Release in Single&#8208;Layered Porous Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22690-22696, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer, homochiral porous sheets with induced pore chirality are reported. The porous sheets perform repeatable asymmetric transformations of absorbed achiral substrates without the help of either chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries. The porous sheets allow diverse asymmetric transformations, including chiral reduction and chiral macrocyclization in a highly size&#8208;selective and stereospecific way.







Abstract
Reported here is the use of single&#8208;layered, chiral porous sheets with induced pore chirality for repeatable asymmetric transformations and self&#8208;separation without the need for chiral catalysts or chiral auxiliaries. The asymmetric induction is driven by chiral fixation of absorbed achiral substrates inside the chiral pores for transformation into enantiopure products with enantioselectivities of greater than 99&#8201;% ee. When the conversion is completed, the products are spontaneously separated out of the pores, enabling the porous sheets to perform repeated cycles of converting achiral substrates into chiral products for release without compromising pore performance. Confinement of achiral substrates into two&#8208;dimensional chiral porous materials provides access to a highly efficient alternative to current asymmetric synthesis methodologies.

         <title>Operando NRIXS and XAFS Investigation of Segregation Phenomena in Fe&#8208;Cu and Fe&#8208;Ag Nanoparticle Catalysts during CO2 Electroreduction</title>

Operando nuclear resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (NRIXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements were used to gain insight into the structure and surface composition of FeCu and FeAg nanoparticles (NPs) during the electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and to extract correlations with their catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Operando nuclear resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (NRIXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements were used to gain insight into the structure and surface composition of FeCu and FeAg nanoparticles (NPs) during the electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and to extract correlations with their catalytic activity and selectivity. The formation of a core&#8211;shell structure during CO2RR for FeAg NPs was inferred from the analysis of the operando NRIXS data (phonon density of states, PDOS) and XAFS measurements. Electrochemical analysis of the FeAg NPs revealed a faradaic selectivity of 36&#8201;% for CO in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE, similar to that of pure Ag NPs. In contrast, a predominant selectivity towards H2 evolution is obtained in the case of the FeCu NPs, analogous to the results obtained for pure Fe NPs, although small Cu NPs have also been shown to favor H2 production.

         <title>Chemistry Evolves, Terms Evolve, but Phenomena Do Not Evolve: From Chalcogen&#8211;Chalcogen Interactions to Chalcogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22306-22310, December 7, 2020. </description>

Chalcogen bonding describes the interaction of Lewis&#8208;acidic chalcogen atoms with a variety of Lewis&#8208;basic atoms. This Viewpoint assesses the development of this term from its predecessor &#8220;chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen interactions&#8221; through discussion of some of the varied and fascinating chemistry it has inspired.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding is important in numerous aspects of chemistry, both in the solid state and in solution. Surveying the literature, it becomes clear that during its rebranding from chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen interactions, some parts of the community have somewhat neglected to recall its discovery and the initial studies referring to it in its previous guise. In this Viewpoint, we trace the path of research into this phenomenon, from its discovery, through its renaming, and to some of the varied and interesting chemistry it has led to so far, ranging from crystal engineering through supramolecular assembly to modern catalysis.

Porous NH3 adsorbents are characterized by insufficient NH3 uptake, low NH3 affinity at low pressure, and poor chemical stability under wet conditions. In their Research Article on page&#8197;22531, C.&#8197;S. Hong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a Mg&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with a high density of open Lewis metal sites along one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal channels shows record&#8208;high NH3 capacities at both very low and high pressures, and remarkable structural stability even under wet NH3 conditions.

Dinuclear cages are metallo&#8208;supramolecular hosts assembled from a minimum of components. Numerous examples for the most trivial, lantern&#8208;shaped topology (two metals bridged by three or four bowed ligands) have been reported, but other structural motifs are rare. In their Communication on page&#8197;22489, G.&#8197;H. Clever and co&#8208;workers detail a new variety for a [Pd2Ligand4] assembly, consisting of two figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped chelate complexes, doubly connected by mechanical bonds. The chiral ligands are based on peptidic macrocycles, giving the nano&#8208;sized object a natural&#8208;product&#8208;like character.

         <title>Impact of Ethylene on Efficiency and Stereocontrol in Olefin Metathesis: When to Add It, When to Remove It, and When to Avoid It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22324-22348, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategic advantage of an olefin metathesis reaction is that the concentration of ethylene, which is often the ignored byproduct, can be manipulated to enhance the efficiency and/or stereoselectivity of a process. In this Minireview, situations where adding, removing, or altogether avoiding ethylene, is the preferred course of action are critically analyzed.







Abstract
Ethylene is the byproduct of olefin metathesis reactions that involve one or more terminal alkenes. Its volatility is one reason why many cross&#8208;metathesis or ring&#8208;closing metathesis processes, which are reversible transformations, are efficient. However, because ethylene can be converted to a methylidene complex, which is a highly reactive but relatively unstable species, its concentration can impact olefin metathesis in other ways. In some cases, introducing excess ethylene can increase reaction rate owing to faster catalyst initiation. Ethylene and a derived methylidene complex can also advantageously inhibit substrate or product homocoupling, and/or divert a less selective pathway. In other instances, a methylidene's low stability and high activity may lead to erosion of efficiency and/or kinetic selectivity, making it preferable that ethylene is removed while being generated. If methylidene decomposition is so fast that there is little or no product formation, it is best that ethylene and methylidene complex formation is avoided altogether. This is accomplished by the use of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes in stereoretentive processes, which includes adopting methylene capping strategy. Here, we analyze the different scenarios through which ethylene and the involvement of methylidene complexes can be manipulated and managed so that an olefin metathesis reaction may occur more efficiently and/or more stereoselectively.

         <title>Beyond Frameworks: Structuring Reticular Materials across Nano&#8208;, Meso&#8208;, and Bulk Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22350-22370, December 7, 2020. </description>

Structuring reticular materials beyond periodic lattices places an emphasis on the surface functionality, morphological manifestation, and the arrangement of crystal constituents at the final stage. By harnessing the power of self&#8208;assembly and external tools, framework structures have been deliberately controlled across all length scales that excel in diverse application scenarios.







Abstract
Reticular materials are of high interest for diverse applications, ranging from catalysis and separation to gas storage and drug delivery. These open, extended frameworks can be tailored to the intended application through crystal&#8208;structure design. Implementing these materials in application settings, however, requires structuring beyond their lattices, to interface the functionality at the molecular level effectively with the macroscopic world. To overcome this barrier, efforts in expressing structural control across molecular, nano&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and bulk regimes is the essential next step. In this Review, we give an overview of recent advances in using self&#8208;assembly as well as externally controlled tools to manufacture reticular materials over all the length scales. We predict that major research advances in deploying these two approaches will facilitate the use of reticular materials in addressing major needs of society.

This Minireview offers a materials&#8208;chemistry perspective on colloidal quantum dots (QD) for display applications, including QD&#8208;enhanced liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;displays (QD&#8208;LCD) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (QLEDs) displays. By illustrating correlations between various display key parameters and QD structures/properties, this perspective further demonstrates the importance of tailored design of QDs for specific applications.







Abstract
This article offers a materials&#8208;chemistry perspective for colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the field of display, including QD&#8208;enhanced liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (QD&#8208;LCD) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (QLEDs) display. The rapid successes of QDs for display in the past five years are not accidental but have a deep root in both maturity of their synthetic chemistry and their unique chemical, optical, and optoelectronic properties. This article intends to discuss the natural match of QD emitters for display and chemical means to eventually bring about their full potential.

         <title>Introducing tox&#8208;Profiles of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22296-22305, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Essay we propose tox&#8208;Profiles of chemical reactions to eliminate misleading preconceptions about the biological activity of organic molecules and to stimulate further progress in the field. tox&#8208;Profiles can be used to classify synthetic reactions, manage the biological activity of molecules, and guide the rational development of new methodologies.







Abstract
In this Essay, we present a critical analysis of two common practices in modern chemistry&#8212;that is, of using speculations about the &#8220;greenness&#8221; and &#8220;nontoxicity&#8221; of developed synthesis procedures and of a priori labelling various compounds derived from natural sources as being environmentally safe. We note that every organic molecule that contains functional groups should be biologically active. Thus, analysis of the particular greenness and the potential environmental impact of a given chemical process should account for the biological activity of all its components in a measureable (rather than empirical) way. We highlight the necessity of clarifying discussions on biological activity and toxicity and propose possible ways of introducing tox&#8208;Profiles as a reliable overview of the overall toxicity of chemical reactions.

         <title>Zwitterionic Peptide Cloak Mimics Protein Surfaces for Protein Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22378-22381, December 7, 2020. </description>

Mimicking amino acid composition of natural protein surfaces, a zwitterionic cloak containing multi&#8208;layers of short alternating glutamic acid and lysine (EK) peptides was developed as a facile and highly effective approach for shielding the protein from specific and non&#8208;specific interactions and immune recognition.







Abstract
Inspired by the amino acid composition of natural protein surfaces, we developed a zwitterionic cloak containing multi&#8208;layers of short alternating glutamic acid and lysine (EK) peptides as a facile, highly effective and low&#8208;immunogenicity approach for the protection and delivery of biotherapeutics. Each EK layer grafted to proteins provides multiple times of new lysine reaction sites for the growth of subsequent EK layers. This unique design allows EK peptides to achieve high coating density on proteins, overcoming the limitation of traditional conjugation strategies that rely on the number of innate lysine groups. A triple&#8208;layer EK cloak manifests to successfully eliminate the specific and non&#8208;specific interactions of protected asparaginase with biological media while prolong the drug circulation time and significantly mitigate its immunogenicity in vivo, suggesting an EK peptide cloak as a promising approach to improve the safety and efficacy of biotherapeutics.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Mediated Reversible Transactivation of Gene Expression by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22414-22418, December 7, 2020. </description>

A three&#8208;component light switch for programmable gene activation is reported. A photoreceptor aptamer pair facilitates reversible control of gene expression and broadens the optoribogenetic toolbox.







Abstract
The investigation and manipulation of cellular processes with subcellular resolution requires non&#8208;invasive tools with spatiotemporal precision and reversibility. Building on the interaction of the photoreceptor PAL with an RNA aptamer, we describe a variation of the CRISPR/dCAS9 system for light&#8208;controlled activation of gene expression. This platform significantly reduces the coding space required for genetic manipulation and provides a strong on&#8208;switch with almost no residual activity in the dark. It adds to the current set of modular building blocks for synthetic biological circuit design and is broadly applicable.

         <title>Aminopotassiation by Mixed Potassium/Lithium Amides: A Synthetic Path to Difficult to Access Phenethylamine Derivates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22500-22504, December 7, 2020. </description>

The use of a mixed&#8208;metal system consisting of LiNR2/KOR increases the selectivity of the aminometalation of styrene derivatives in favour of a potassiated intermediate over a polymerization product. Crystal structures along with quantum chemical calculations and experimental investigations demonstrate the additional advantages of potassium over lithium or sodium for the stability of metalated phenylethylamines.







Abstract
Insights gained from a comparison of aminometalation reactions with lithium amides, potassium amides and mixed lithium/potassium amides are presented. A combination of structural characterization, DFT calculations and electrophile reactions of aminometalated intermediates has shown the advantages of using a mixed metal strategy. While potassium amides fail to add, the lithium amides are uncontrollable and eliminated, yet the mixed K/Li amides deliver the best of both systems. Aminopotassiation proceeds to form the alkylpotassium species which has enhanced stability over its lithium counterpart allowing for its isolation and thereby its further characterization.

         <title>A New Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked [Pd2L4] Cage Motif by Dimerization of two Peptide&#8208;based Lemniscates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22489-22493, December 7, 2020. </description>

A chiral macrocycle, equipped with two pyridine donors, assembles with PdII cations to an unprecedented metallo&#8208;supramolecular architecture by pairwise catenation of two figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped subunits. Interlocking in solid state and solution is driven by close non&#8208;covalent interaction between the basket&#8208;shaped macrocycles and coordinating ligand arms.







Abstract
Most metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies of low nuclearity adopt simple topologies, with bridging ligands spanning neighboring metal centers in a direct fashion. Here we contribute a new structural motif to the family of host compounds with low metal count (two) that consists of a pair of doubly&#8208;interlocked, Figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped subunits, also termed &#8220;lemniscates&#8221;. Each metal is chelated by two chiral bidentate ligands, composed of a peptidic macrocycle that resembles a natural product with two pyridyl&#8208;terminated arms. DFT calculation results suggest that dimerization of the mononuclear halves is driven by a combination of 1)&#8197;Coulomb interaction with a central anion, 2)&#8197;&#960;&#8208;stacking between intertwined ligand arms and 3)&#8197;dispersive interactions between the structure's compact inner core bedded into an outer shell composed of the cavitand&#8208;type macrocycles. The resulting cage&#8208;like architecture was characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray structure analyses. This new mechanically bonded system highlights the scope of structural variety accessible in metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies composed of only a few constituents.

     alt="A New Mechanically&#8208;Interlocked [Pd2L4] Cage Motif by Dimerization of two Peptide&#8208;based Lemniscates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral macrocycle, equipped with two pyridine donors, assembles with Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; cations to an unprecedented metallo&#8208;supramolecular architecture by pairwise catenation of two figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped subunits. Interlocking in solid state and solution is driven by close non&#8208;covalent interaction between the basket&#8208;shaped macrocycles and coordinating ligand arms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies of low nuclearity adopt simple topologies, with bridging ligands spanning neighboring metal centers in a direct fashion. Here we contribute a new structural motif to the family of host compounds with low metal count (two) that consists of a pair of doubly&#8208;interlocked, Figure&#8208;eight&#8208;shaped subunits, also termed &#8220;lemniscates&#8221;. Each metal is chelated by two chiral bidentate ligands, composed of a peptidic macrocycle that resembles a natural product with two pyridyl&#8208;terminated arms. DFT calculation results suggest that dimerization of the mononuclear halves is driven by a combination of 1)&#8197;Coulomb interaction with a central anion, 2)&#8197;&#960;&#8208;stacking between intertwined ligand arms and 3)&#8197;dispersive interactions between the structure's compact inner core bedded into an outer shell composed of the cavitand&#8208;type macrocycles. The resulting cage&#8208;like architecture was characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray structure analyses. This new mechanically bonded system highlights the scope of structural variety accessible in metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies composed of only a few constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exotic Compositional Ordering in Manganese&#8211;Nickel&#8211;Arsenic (Mn&#8208;Ni&#8208;As) Intermetallics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22382-22387, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unravel a structural feature that has remained unsolved for decades. An incommensurate occupational modulation creates a particular nanoscale ordering of MnAs and NiAs layers in the intermetallic Mn0.60Ni0.40As solid solution phase. We have investigated this phenomenon by 3D electron diffraction (PEDT), high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) imaging, and neutron diffraction.







Abstract
In this work we benefited from recent advances in tools for crystal&#8208;structure analysis that enabled us to describe an exotic nanoscale phenomenon in structural chemistry. The Mn0.60Ni0.40As sample of the Mn1&#8722;xNixAs solid solution, exhibits an incommensurate compositional modulation intimately coupled with positional modulations. The average structure is of the simple NiAs type, but in contrast to a normal solid solution, we observe that manganese and nickel segregate periodically at the nano&#8208;level into ordered MnAs and NiAs layers with thickness of 2&#8211;4 face&#8208;shared octahedra. The detailed description was obtained by combination of 3D electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and neutron diffraction. The distribution of the manganese and nickel layers is perfectly described by a modulation vector q=0.360(3) c*. Displacive modulations are observed for all elements as a consequence of the occupational modulation, and as a means to achieve acceptable Ni&#8211;As and Mn&#8211;As distances. This modulated evolution of magnetic MnAs and non&#8208;magnetic NiAs&#8208;layers with periodicity at approximately 10&#8197;&#197; level, may provide an avenue for spintronics.

The tertiary alkylative cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl or aryl electrophiles by using benzylic organoboronates is reported. This reaction involves the generation of tertiary alkyl anions from organoboronates in the presence of an alkoxide base and then substitution reactions under mild and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Enzymatic Building&#8208;Block Synthesis for Solid&#8208;Phase Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22456-22459, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a chemoenzymatic approach to oligosaccharide synthesis, the scalability potential of enzymatic synthesis was exploited for the preparative synthesis of a relevant N&#8208;acetyllactosamine disaccharide building block. This disaccharide was then applied successfully to the automated synthesis of a target oligosaccharide using the glycan synthesizer Glyconeer&#8197;2.1 (see scheme).







Abstract
Automated chemical oligosaccharide synthesis is an attractive concept that has been successfully applied to a large number of target structures, but requires excess quantities of suitably protected and activated building blocks. Herein we demonstrate the use of biocatalysis to supply such reagents for automated synthesis. By using the promiscuous NmLgtB&#8208;B &#946;1&#8208;4 galactosyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis we demonstrate fast and robust access to the LacNAc motif, common to many cell&#8208;surface glycans, starting from either lactose or sucrose as glycosyl donors. The enzymatic product was shown to be successfully incorporated as a complete unit into a tetrasaccharide target by automated assembly.

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Methane with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine and Zinc&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Tandem Catalyst</title>

CO2 is first electrochemically reduced into CO over CoPc. The CO then diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH4 over the Zn&#8208;N4 site, decoupling the CO2 electroreduction pathway on a single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction which shows a more than 100&#8197;times enhancement of the CH4/CO production rate ratio compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone.







Abstract
Developing copper&#8208;free catalysts for CO2 conversion into hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we report a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and zinc&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) tandem catalyst for CO2RR to CH4. This tandem catalyst shows a more than 100&#8197;times enhancement of the CH4/CO production rate ratio compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical CO reduction reaction results suggest that CO2 is first reduced into CO over CoPc and then CO diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH4 over Zn&#8208;N4 site, decoupling complicated CO2RR pathway on single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction. Moreover, mechanistic analysis indicates that CoPc not only generates CO but also enhances the availability of *H over adjacent N sites in Zn&#8208;N4, which is the key to achieve the high CH4 production rate and understand the intriguing electrocatalytic behavior which is distinctive to copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts.

         <title>Probing Cooperativity of N&#8208;Terminal Domain Orientations in the p97 Molecular Machine: Synergy Between NMR Spectroscopy and Cryo&#8208;EM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22423-22426, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cryo&#8208;EM study to investigate the cooperativity of N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD) up/down conformational transitions in an R95G homo&#8208;hexameric disease mutant of p97 is presented. The 14 unique conformational states of the complex were successfully classified and their populations fit to a model to address the cooperativity of the NTD transitions.







Abstract
The hexameric p97 enzyme plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis. Large changes to the orientation of its N&#8208;terminal domains (NTDs), corresponding to NTD&#8208;down (p97&#8208;ADP) or NTD&#8208;up (p97&#8208;ATP), accompany ATP hydrolysis. The NTDs in a series of p97 disease mutants interconvert rapidly between up and down conformations when p97 is in the ADP&#8208;bound state. While the populations of up and down NTDs can be determined from bulk measurements, information about the cooperativity of the transition between conformations is lacking. Here we use cryo&#8208;EM to determine populations of the 14 unique up/down NTD states of the homo&#8208;hexameric R95G disease&#8208;causing p97 ring, showing that NTD orientations do not depend on those of neighboring subunits. In contrast, NMR studies establish that inter&#8208;protomer cooperativity is important for regulating the orientation of NTDs in p97 particles comprising mixtures of different subunits, such as wild&#8208;type and R95G, emphasizing the synergy between cryo&#8208;EM and NMR in establishing how the components of p97 function.

         <title>Engineering the Protein Corona Structure on Gold Nanoclusters Enables Red&#8208;Shifted Emissions in the Second Near&#8208;infrared Window for Gastrointestinal Imaging</title>

The precise control of the surface protein corona enabled the red&#8208;shifting of the emission of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) into the NIR&#8208;II region. RNAse&#8208;A&#8208;encapsulated AuNCs allowed the visualization of the detailed structures of the GI tract during gastrointestinal peristalsis, providing a non&#8208;invasive and X&#8208;ray&#8208;free technique to differentiate intestinal tumours.







Abstract
The application of NIR&#8208;II emitters for gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging remains challenging due to fluorescence quenching in the digestive microenvironment. Herein, we report that red&#8208;shifting of the fluorescence emission of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) into NIR&#8208;II region with improved quantum yields (QY) could be achieved by engineering a protein corona structure consisting of a ribonuclease&#8208;A (RNase&#8208;A) on the particle surfaces. RNase&#8208;A&#8208;encapsulated AuNCs (RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs) displayed emissions at 1050&#8197;nm with a 1.9&#8201;% QY. Compared to rare earth and silver&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II emitters, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs had excellent biocompatibility, showing &gt;50&#8208;fold higher sensitivity in GI tract, and migrated homogenously during gastrointestinal peristalsis to allow visualization of the detailed structures of the GI tract. RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs could successfully examine intestinal tumor mice from healthy mice, indicating a potential utility for early diagnosis of intestinal tumors.

An integrated microfluidic probe (iMFP) is designed and produced to enable the broader use of liquid&#8208;extraction&#8208;based mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). It is easy to align and its stability and sensitivity are comparable to capillary&#8208;based nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) MSI. The iMFP was used to image phospholipid distribution in mouse uterine tissue with a spatial resolution of better than 25&#8197;&#956;m.







Abstract
Ambient ionization based on liquid extraction is widely used in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of molecules in biological samples. The development of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) has enabled the robust imaging of tissue sections with high spatial resolution. However, the fabrication of the nano&#8208;DESI probe is challenging, which limits its dissemination to the broader scientific community. Herein, we describe the design and performance of an integrated microfluidic probe (iMFP) for nano&#8208;DESI MSI. The glass iMFP, fabricated using photolithography, wet etching, and polishing, shows comparable performance to the capillary&#8208;based nano&#8208;DESI MSI in terms of stability and sensitivity; a spatial resolution of better than 25&#8197;&#956;m was obtained in these first proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiments. The iMFP is easy to operate and align in front of a mass spectrometer, which will facilitate broader use of liquid&#8208;extraction&#8208;based MSI in biological research, drug discovery, and clinical studies.

         <title>Hydroxamic Acids Immobilized on Resins (HAIRs): Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Targeting HDAC Inhibitors and HDAC Degraders (PROTACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22494-22499, December 7, 2020. </description>

Hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) were developed and utilized for the library synthesis of DNA&#8208;alkylating HDAC inhibitors and a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HDAC degrader (PROTAC). A hybrid compound based on the pharmacophores of chlorambucil and panobinostat was identified as the most promising chimeric HDAC inhibitor and demonstrated improved anticancer properties compared to the sum of the activities of either pharmacophore alone.







Abstract
Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase&#8208;supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3&#8201;n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.

         <title>Unveiling the Promotion of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Chalcogenate on the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22470-22474, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The actual role of chalcogens in transition metal chalcogenides as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts is ambiguous. We found the surface&#8208;adsorbed selenates and sulfates, either from in situ oxidation of transition metal chalcogenides or extra addition, played vital roles in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. These results open up new paradigms for the development of adsorption&#8208;modulated efficient electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;electrocatalysts, and will in situ transform into metal (oxy)hydroxides under OER condition. However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe2 as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se&#8208;Se to selenites (SeO32&#8722;) then to selenates (SeO42&#8722;). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)2 dramatically enhance its OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;electrocatalysts, and will in situ transform into metal (oxy)hydroxides under OER condition. However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se&#8208;Se to selenites (SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) then to selenates (SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dramatically enhance its OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Quantitative One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Homochiral Helical Receptors Enabling Enantioselective Binding</title>

Homochiral helical receptors are quantitatively assembled from short precursors in the presence of appropriate templates via three sequential steps in one pot, and these receptors bind chiral guests used as the templates with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Template&#8208;directed synthesis and dynamic covalent chemistry were implemented to achieve quantitative one&#8208;pot syntheses of homochiral helical cavities inside aromatic foldamers. One&#8208;handed helical receptors P&#8208;1, M&#8208;1, P&#8208;2 and M&#8208;2 were assembled from their precursors in the presence of appropriate templates (d&#8208; and l&#8208;tartaric acid, and d&#8208; and l&#8208;sorbitol, respectively) via three sequential steps in one pot: imine&#8208;linked chain elongation, template&#8208;induced folding and [4+2] cycloaddition between helical turns. These helical receptors were proven to enantioselectively bind chiral guests used as the templates, and the differences between the association constants of enantiomeric guests were up to more than two orders of magnitude. The structures and binding modes of the receptors were fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Isotope Effects in Plasmonic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22480-22483, December 7, 2020. </description>

In plasmon&#8208;excitation&#8208;driven photosynthesis on Au nanoparticles, the primary step is the hole&#8208;mediated splitting of water, which supplies protons and electrons for carbon dioxide conversion. This mechanistic insight into a complex, multistep transformation was obtained from measurements of kinetic isotope effects in the reaction (see picture).







Abstract
The photoexcitation of plasmonic nanoparticles has been shown to drive multistep, multicarrier transformations, such as the conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbons. But for such plasmon&#8208;driven chemistry to be precisely understood and modeled, the critical photoinitiation step in the reaction cascade must be identified. We meet this goal by measuring H/D and 12C/13C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in plasmonic photosynthesis. In particular, we found that the substitution of H2O with D2O slows hydrocarbon production by a factor of 5&#8211;8. This primary H/D KIE leads to the inference that hole&#8208;driven scission of the O&#8722;H bond in H2O is a critical, limiting step in plasmonic photosynthesis. This study advances mechanistic understanding of light&#8208;driven chemical reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles.

         <title>Metal Nanozyme with Ester Hydrolysis Activity in the Presence of Ammonia&#8208;Borane and Its Use in a Sensitive Immunosensor</title>

Metal nanoparticle surfaces rapidly catalyze non&#8208;redox ester hydrolysis in the presence of redox H3N&#8722;BH3. Metal hydrides on a Pt nanoparticle might assist nucleophilic attack of H2O on the carbonyl group of an ester. The ester hydrolysis is applied in a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for thyroid&#8208;stimulating hormone detection.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticle surfaces are used for peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like nanozymes but not for esterase&#8208;like nanozymes. It is challenging to obtain rapid catalytic hydrolysis on a metal surface and even more so without a catalytically labile substrate. Here, we report that metal nanoparticle surfaces rapidly catalyze non&#8208;redox ester hydrolysis in the presence of redox H3N&#8722;BH3 (AB). Metal hydrides are readily generated on a Pt nanoparticle (PtNP) from AB, and as a result the PtNP becomes electron&#8208;rich, which might assist nucleophilic attack of H2O on the carbonyl group of an ester. The nanozyme system based on PtNP, AB, and 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;yl acetate provides an electrochemical signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio much higher than natural enzymes, due to the rapid ester hydrolysis and redox cycling involving the hydrolysis product. The nanozyme system is applied in a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for thyroid&#8208;stimulating hormone detection. The calculated detection limit is approximately 0.3&#8197;pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1, which indicates the high sensitivity of the immunosensor using the PtNP nanozyme.

What can be done do when theory fails to provide a structural candidate? Using experimental isotopic data and a Python program, we establish a carbon backbone structure and eventually identify the elusive heterochiral propylene oxide trimer shown from 89 initial candidates.







Abstract
The chirality controlled conformational landscape of the trimer of propylene oxide (PO), a prototypical chiral molecule, was investigated using rotational spectroscopy and a range of theoretical tools for conformational searches and for evaluating vibrational contributions to effective structures. Two sets of homochiral (PO)3 rotational transitions were assigned and the associated conformers identified with theoretical support. One set of heterochiral (PO)3 transitions was assigned, but no structures generated by one of the latest, advanced conformational search codes could account for them. With the aid of a Python program, the carbon atom backbone and then the heterochiral (PO)3 structure were generated using 13C isotopic data. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental rotational constants and relative dipole moment components of all three conformers was achieved, especially after applying vibrational corrections to the rotational constants.

&lt;p&gt;What can be done do when theory fails to provide a structural candidate? Using experimental isotopic data and a Python program, we establish a carbon backbone structure and eventually identify the elusive heterochiral propylene oxide trimer shown from 8&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; initial candidates.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions of a Molecular Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22446-22450, December 7, 2020. </description>

Structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO3)2(n&#8208;BuPO3)4MoV4MoVI14O49]5&#8722; were examined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na+ encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature (see picture).







Abstract
The structural phase of a metal oxide changes with temperature and pressure. During phase transitions, component ions move in multidimensional metal&#8211;oxygen networks. Such macroscopic structural events are robust to changes in particle size, even at scales of around 10&#8197;nm, and size effects limiting these transitions are particularly important in, for example, high&#8208;density memory applications of ferroelectrics. In this study, we examined structural transitions of the molecular metal oxide [Na@(SO3)2(n&#8208;BuPO3)4MoV4MoVI14O49]5&#8722; (Molecule 1) at approximately 2&#8197;nm by using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The Na+ encapsulated in the discrete metal&#8208;oxide anion exhibited a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition with distortion of the Mo&#8211;O molecular framework induced by temperature. Similar order&#8211;disorder transitions were also triggered by chemical pressure induced by removing crystalline solvent molecules in the single&#8208;crystal state or by substituting the countercation to change the molecular packing.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Hydroamidation of Styrenes to Branched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22441-22445, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed hydroamidation of vinylarenes with hydroxyamine derivatives has been developed. The method displays broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and proceeds under mild conditions to afford branched amides. The asymmetric variant of this transformation was also achieved by applying (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE as the ligand, delivering the &#945;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Amides are one of the most ubiquitous functional groups in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Novel and rapid synthesis of amides remains in high demand. In this communication, a general and efficient procedure for branch&#8208;selective hydroamidation of vinylarenes with hydroxyamine derivatives enabled by copper catalysis has been developed for the first time. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Applying a chiral phosphine ligand, an enantioselective variant of this transformation was achieved, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;amides with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and high yields.

         <title>Interfacial Structure of Water as a New Descriptor of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

On nickel&#8211;platinum alloy nanoparticles under alkaline conditions, the reactivity of interfacial water varies with its structure and the order of water dissociation. The inclusion of nickel re&#8208;orientates interfacial water molecules with their hydrogen atoms pointing towards the electrode surface, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Driven by the persisting poor understanding of the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt in alkaline media, a direct correlation of the interfacial water structure and activity is still yet to be established. Herein, using Pt and Pt&#8211;Ni nanoparticles we first demonstrate a strong dependence of the proton donor structure on the HER activity and pH. The structure of the first layer changes from the proton acceptors to the donors with increasing pH. In the base, the reactivity of the interfacial water varied its structure, and the activation energies of water dissociation increased in the sequence: the dangling O&#8722;H bonds &lt; the trihedrally coordinated water &lt; the tetrahedrally coordinated water. Moreover, optimizing the adsorption of H and OH intermediates can re&#8208;orientate the interfacial water molecules with their H atoms pointing towards the electrode surface, thereby enhancing the kinetics of HER. Our results clarified the dynamic role of the water structure at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface during HER and the design of highly efficient HER catalysts.

The dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly of fourteen units of bis(perfluorocatecholato)silane delivers a giant perfluorinated macrocycle. The oligomerization process occurs by an unprecedented low&#8208;barrier silicon&#8211;oxygen &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis&#8212;revealing constitutional dynamics for one of the strongest bonds in our geosphere.







Abstract
The dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly of 14 units of bis(perfluorocatecholato)silane leads to [Si(O2C6F4)2]14&#8212;the first giant perfluorinated macrocycle. The oligomerization process is monitored spectroscopically, and the macrocycle analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The molecule forms a rigid cavity that can host two o&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecacarboranes. Computations rationalize the consistent and reproducible formation of the 14mer and disclose a non&#8208;catalyzed Si&#8722;O/ Si&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis with an exceptionally low energetic barrier. For the first time, the most prevalent linker in our geosphere&#8208;SiO4&#8208;is disposed to construct a shape&#8208;defined crystalline macromolecule.

         <title>CeIV&#8208; and HClO4&#8208;Promoted Assembly of an Fe2IV(&#956;&#8208;O)2 Diamond Core from its Monomeric FeIV=O Precursor at Room Temperature</title>

Spontaneous assembly! The spontaneous assembly of monomeric oxoiron(IV) units into an FeIV2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 diamond core complex is observed in the presence of CAN and excess HClO4 at room temperature, an unexpected and unprecedented avenue for accessing high valent diamond core complexes.







Abstract
Diiron(IV)&#8208;oxo species are proposed to effect the cleavage of strong C&#8722;H bonds by nonheme diiron enzymes such as soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and fatty acid desaturases. However, synthetic mimics of such diiron(IV) oxidants are rare. Herein we report the reaction of (TPA*)FeII (1) (TPA*=tris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;methoxypyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;methyl)amine) in CH3CN with 4&#8197;equiv CAN and 200&#8197;equiv HClO4 at 20&#8201;&#176;C to form a complex with an [FeIV2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]4+ core. CAN and HClO4 play essential roles in this unprecedented transformation, in which the comproportionation of FeIII&#8208;O&#8208;CeIV and FeIV=O/Ce4+ species is proposed to be involved in the assembly of the [FeIV2(&#956;&#8208;O)2]4+ core.

         <title>Design of a Single&#8208;Atom Indium&#948;+&#8211;N4 Interface for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to Formate</title>

A new indium single&#8208;atom catalyst with In&#948;+&#8211;N4 atomic interface active sites is constructed for electroreduction of CO2 to formate. The system has a more negative potential and high Faradaic efficiency. This approach offers an effective strategy to develop superior main group metal CO2ER catalysts with not only high activity but also high selectivity.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group element indium (In) is a promising electrocatalyst which triggers CO2 reduction to formate, while the high overpotential and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) hinder its practical application. Herein, we rationally design a new In single&#8208;atom catalyst containing exclusive isolated In&#948;+&#8211;N4 atomic interface sites for CO2 electroreduction to formate with high efficiency. This catalyst exhibits an extremely large turnover frequency (TOF) up to 12500&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), with a FE for formate of 96&#8201;% and current density of 8.87&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at low potential of &#8722;0.65&#8197;V versus RHE. Our findings present a feasible strategy for the accurate regulation of main&#8208;group indium catalysts for CO2 reduction at atomic scale.

         <title>How Big is the Pinacol Boronic Ester as a Substituent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22403-22407, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bpin group is generally perceived to be a sterically bulky substituent, but the data reported here show that it has a surprisingly small A&#8208;value (0.42&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1; cf. Me is 1.7, OH is 0.87). The percent buried volume seems to give a more accurate indication of the size of the Bpin moiety, which is somewhere between a primary and secondary alkyl group.







Abstract
The synthetically versatile pinacol boronic ester group (Bpin) is generally thought of as a bulky moiety because of the two adjacent quaternary sp3&#8208;hydribized carbon atoms in its diol backbone. However, recent diastereoselective reactions reported in the literature have cast doubt on this perception. Reported herein is a detailed experimental and computational analysis of Bpin and structurally related boronic esters which allows determination of three different steric parameters for the Bpin group: the A&#8208;value, ligand cone angle, and percent buried volume. All three parameters suggest that the Bpin moiety is remarkably small, with the planarity of the oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen motif playing an important role in minimising steric interactions. Of the three steric parameters, percent buried volume provides the best correlation between steric size and diastereoselectivity in a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction.

         <title>Synthetic C6&#8208;Functionalized Aminoflavin Catalysts Enable Aerobic Bromination of Oxidation&#8208;Prone Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22505-22509, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation with visible light, synthetic C6 aminoflavin catalysts are reversibly reduced by 2,6&#8208;lutidinium oxalate and allow the activation of molecular oxygen. In the presence of halide salt, the strategy is successful in the biomimetic halogenation of oxidation&#8208;prone tyrosine, flavone, as well as flavanone substrates, while natural (&#8722;)&#8208;riboflavin leads to decomposition.







Abstract
Flavoenzymes catalyze oxidations via hydroperoxide intermediates that result from activation of molecular O2. These reactions&#8212;such as hydroxylation and halogenation&#8212;depend on the additional catalytic activity of functional groups in the peptide environment of the flavin cofactor. We report synthetic flavin catalysts that contain C6 amino modifications at the isoalloxazine core and are consequently capable of mediating halogenations outside the peptide surrounding. The catalysts are competent in the selective, biomimetic bromination of oxidation&#8208;prone phenols, flavones, and flavanones using a halide salt in combination with 2,6&#8208;lutidinium oxalate as a flavin reductant under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Our studies show the beneficial effect of stacked bisflavins as well as the catalytic activity of the flavin modifications. The designed flavin catalysts outperform isolated natural (&#8722;)&#8208;riboflavin and contribute to the continuing search for tailored flavins in oxidation reactions.

         <title>Sequential Solid&#8208;State Transformations Involving Consecutive Rearrangements of Secondary Building Units in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF)</title>

The interpenetrated framework of UPC&#8208;600 converted into a non&#8208;interpenetrated framework UPC&#8208;601 in a single&#8208;crystal to single crystal (SCSC) fashion by the rearrangement of two rod&#8208;shaped structural building units (SBUs) in different networks to give a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. As the temperature increases, UPC&#8208;601 is converted into UPC&#8208;602 with rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transformations in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are important and have led to the creation of new MOF structures. Solid&#8208;state transformations from interpenetrated to non&#8208;interpenetrated networks involving rearrangement of secondary building units (SBUs) in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion have not been explored to date. Herein, we report the sequential, thermally stimulated solid&#8208;state transformations in a barium&#8208;organic framework (UPC&#8208;600). The two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework of UPC&#8208;600 is converted at 373&#8197;K into UPC&#8208;601, a non&#8208;interpenetrated framework. This proceeds in a SCSC fashion and involves the rearrangement of two proximate rod&#8208;shaped SBUs in different nets to generate a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. At 473&#8197;K, a continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement occurred, UPC&#8208;601 converted into UPC&#8208;602 by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU.

&lt;p&gt;The interpenetrated framework of &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;600&lt;/b&gt; converted into a non&#8208;interpenetrated framework &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;601&lt;/b&gt; in a single&#8208;crystal to single crystal (SCSC) fashion by the rearrangement of two rod&#8208;shaped structural building units (SBUs) in different networks to give a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. As the temperature increases, &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;601&lt;/b&gt; is converted into &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;602&lt;/b&gt; with rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid&#8208;state transformations in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are important and have led to the creation of new MOF structures. Solid&#8208;state transformations from interpenetrated to non&#8208;interpenetrated networks involving rearrangement of secondary building units (SBUs) in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion have not been explored to date. Herein, we report the sequential, thermally stimulated solid&#8208;state transformations in a barium&#8208;organic framework (&lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;600&lt;/b&gt;). The two&#8208;fold interpenetrated framework of &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;600&lt;/b&gt; is converted at 373&#8197;K into &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;601&lt;/b&gt;, a non&#8208;interpenetrated framework. This proceeds in a SCSC fashion and involves the rearrangement of two proximate rod&#8208;shaped SBUs in different nets to generate a new rod&#8208;shaped SBU. At 473&#8197;K, a continuous solid&#8208;state transformation involving a second rearrangement occurred, &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;601&lt;/b&gt; converted into &lt;b&gt;UPC&#8208;602&lt;/b&gt; by the rearrangement of the 1D rod&#8208;shaped SBU to a 2D layer SBU. This is the first example of such a thermally driven stepwise transformation involving simultaneous cleavage and regeneration of multiple bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atropisomeric Hydrogen Bonding Control for CO2 Binding and Enhancement of Electrocatalytic Reduction at Iron Porphyrins</title>

Adapting the 3D topological layout of an iron porphyrin catalyst bearing urea groups as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors in the second sphere can induce a switch from higher affinity for CO2 binding to faster reaction rate for the CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to CO.







Abstract
The manipulation of the second coordination sphere for improving the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has led to breakthroughs with hydrogen bonding, local proton source, or electrostatic effects. We have developed two atropisomers of an iron porphyrin complex with two urea functions acting as multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding tweezers to lock the metal&#8208;bound CO2 in a similar fashion found in the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) enzyme. The &#945;&#945; topological isomer with the two urea groups on the same side of the porphyrin provides a stronger binding affinity to tether the incoming CO2 in comparison to the &#945;&#946; disposition. However, the electrocatalytic activity of the &#945;&#946; atropisomer outperforms its congener with one of the highest reported turnover frequencies at low overpotential. The strong H/D kinetic isotope effect (KIE) observed for the &#945;&#945; system indicates the existence of a tight water hydrogen&#8208;bonding network for proton delivery which is disrupted by addition of an acid source. The small H/D KIE for the &#945;&#946; isomer and the enhanced electrocatalytic performance on addition of stronger acid indicate the free access of protons to the bound CO2 on the opposite side of the urea arm.

         <title>An Electrochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 50, Page 22392-22396, December 7, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile and efficient electrophoretic deposition was used to prepare an electrochromic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework film (see picture), which exhibited reversible electrochromism with the advantages of long cycle life, ready regeneration, and tunable electrochromic behavior. An electrochromic device was manufactured with the film to further demonstrate its application potential.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) possess various merits, such as high porosity, tunable structure, facile modification, and ready regeneration. These properties have yet to be explored in the context of new functional HOF materials. The facile and inexpensive electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method applied in this study generated a transparent HOF film at room temperature in just 2&#8197;min and is applicable to other HOFs. The resulting film exhibited reversible electrochromism with the advantage of long cycle life (&gt;500&#8197;cycles). More strikingly, this all&#8208;organic film could be readily regenerated (through rinsing with DMF and redeposition) and showed tunable electrochromic behavior (through low&#8208;cost postsynthetic modification) with the ability to undergo successive color changes, which is difficult to achieve with conventional electrochromic materials. An electrochromic device was manufactured to further demonstrate the application potential of the film.

         <title>Dinuclear Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates Composed of Tetradentate Ligands with Aluminum(III) Chromophores: Optical Resolution and Multi&#8208;color Circularly Polarized Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a set of chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, based on tetradentate ligands and AlIII ions, the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization. They show multi&#8208;color emission with mirror&#8208;image circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and the solid&#8208;state. A mixture of different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL character.







Abstract
New chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, composed of tetradentate ligands with aluminum(III) ions, are described. These are synthesized in two steps using inexpensive pyrrole derivatives, hydrazine, and aluminum chloride. These molecular architectures (ALPHY) show multi&#8208;color (cyan, yellow, and orange) photoluminescence in solution and in the solid&#8208;state, which depends on the substituents of the ligands. The photoluminescence quantum yields of helicates were up to 54&#8201;%. The right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization in some solvents and are mirror images according to circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an absolute luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of up to the 10&#8722;3 order. Mixing the different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL characters. This study offers a glimpse into the potential applications of chromophores with diverse photophysical properties.

         <title>A Stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene with a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Ferrocenediyl Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclic diaminosilylene featuring a ferrocene&#8208;based backbone is reported. The dicoordinate SiII atom is part of a six&#8208;membered FeC2N2Si ring and shows a comparatively large bond angle of ca. 107&#176;. This N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene can activate strong bonds (C=O, N=O, B&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, P&#8722;H, O&#8722;H) under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene [{Fe(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4&#8208;NDipp)2}Si] (1DippSi, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) shows an excellent combination of pronounced thermal stability and high reactivity towards small molecules. It reacts readily with CO2 and N2O, respectively affording (1DippSiO2)2C and (1DippSiO)2 as follow&#8208;up products of the silanone 1DippSiO. Its reactions with H2O, NH3, and FcPH2 (Fc=ferrocenyl) furnish the respective oxidative addition products 1DippSi(H)X (X=OH, NH2, PHFc). Its reaction with H3BNH3 unexpectedly results in B&#8722;H, instead of N&#8722;H, bond activation, affording 1DippSi(H)(BH2NH3). DFT results suggest that dramatically different mechanisms are operative for these H&#8722;X insertions.

         <title>Reversible Silylium Transfer between P&#8208;H and Si&#8208;H Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PIII Lewis superacid with an ancillary molybdenum carbonyl fragment reacts with Et3SiH to give a P&#8208;H stabilized silylium ion that participates in catalytic hydrosilylation.







Abstract
The Mo=PR2 &#960;* orbital in a Mo phosphenium complex acts as acceptor in a new PIII&#8208;based Lewis superacid. This Lewis acid (LA) participates in electrophilic Si&#8208;H abstraction from E3SiH to give a Mo&#8208;bound secondary phosphine ligand, Mo&#8208;PR2H. The resulting Et3Si+ ion remains associated with the Mo complex, stabilized by &#951;1&#8208;P&#8208;H donation, yet undergoes rapid exchange with an &#951;1&#8208;Si&#8208;H adduct of free silane in solution. The equilibrium between these two adducts presents an opportunity to assess the role of this new LA in catalytic reactions of silanes: is the LA acting as a catalyst or as an initiator? Preliminary results suggest that a cycle including the Mo&#8208;bound phosphine&#8208;silylium adduct dominates in the catalytic hydrosilylation of acetophenone, relative to a putative cycle involving the silane&#8208;silylium adduct or &#8220;free&#8221; silylium.

         <title>An Imine&#8208;Linked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Reactive Oxygen Species Generator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constituting imine linkages between trinuclear CuI&#8208;based complexes and diamine creates a metal&#8211;organic framework with honeycomb layers in eclipsed packing. Two kinds of structural vacancies are identified quantitatively by selective coordination dissociation. The structure could catalyze H2O2 decomposition and consequently excite O2 to reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with both coordination linkages and covalent linkages is prepared by coordinating CuI with pyrazolate for an aldehyde&#8208;functionalized trinuclear complex, and subsequent imine condensation with p&#8208;phenylenediamine, a reaction typical for covalent organic framework (COF) synthesis. This MOF&#215;COF collaboration yields FDM&#8208;71 with honeycomb layers stacked in eclipsed fashion. After dissociating the CuI&#8208;pyrazolate coordination in FDM&#8208;71, the obtained organic components carry the information of structural defects, and thus vacancy identity (aldehyde&#8208;based unit vacancy and amine&#8208;based unit vacancy) and concentration are definitely resolved. Further to the redox catalytic activity inherited from the complex, FDM&#8208;71 features effective photosensitizing activity. The two functions integrated in one well&#8208;defined structure is demonstrated by its high efficiency in decomposing H2O2 and consequent excitation of O2 to reactive oxygen species.

         <title>15N NMR Hyperpolarization of Radiosensitizing Antibiotic Nimorazole by Reversible Parahydrogen Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 15N3&#8208;enriched antibiotic and hypoxic radiosensitizer nimorazole is reported. Spin&#8208;relayed signal amplification by reversible exchange in microtesla magnetic field yielded up to 3.2&#8201;% 15N nuclear spin polarization with relaxation time constant of 5.9&#177;0.2&#8197;min at 1.4 T. The isomer of nimorazole formed in the synthesis was also hyperpolarized indicating that this approach can be extended to a wide range of nitroimidazole&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole&#8208;based family of antibiotics to fight against anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and neck cancers. We envision the use of [15N3]nimorazole as a theragnostic hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next&#8208;generation MRI&#8208;LINAC systems. Herein, we report the first steps to create long&#8208;lasting (for tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three 15N sites of [15N3]nimorazole with T1 of up to ca. 6&#8197;minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ca. 67000&#8208;fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to P15N of 3.2&#8201;%) by 15N&#8722;15N spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization technique, relying on simultaneous exchange of [15N3]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir&#8208;IMes catalyst. The presented results pave the way to efficient spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization of a wide range of imidazole&#8208;based antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

         <title>CoNi Alloy Nanoparticles Embedded in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Carbon for the Highly Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton via a Charge&#8208;Transfer Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr is achieved on CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded MOF&#8208;derived carbon adsorbents via charge&#8208;transfer effect. It affords record&#8208;high IAST selectivity and Henty's selectivity of Xe/Kr mixture.







Abstract
Separation of Xe and Kr is one of the greatest challenges in the gas industries owing to their close molecular structure and similar properties. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation using chemically stable carbon adsorbents is a promising technology. We propose a strategy for Xe/Kr separation using MOF&#8208;derived metallic carbon adsorbents. M&#8208;Gallate (M=Ni, Co) were used as precursors to fabricate CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded carbon adsorbents by one&#8208;step auto&#8208;reduction pyrolysis. The optimal NiCo@C&#8208;700 exhibits record&#8208;high IAST selectivity (24.1) and Henry's selectivity (20.1) of Xe/Kr among reported carbon adsorbents. DFT calculations, local density of states calculation, charge density difference, and Bader charge analysis reveal the great affinity with Xe benefits from the presence of Ni or CoNi nanoparticles as a result of more charge transfer from Xe than Kr to metal, thus providing higher binding energy. Breakthrough experiments further verify NiCo@C&#8208;700 a promising candidate for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Insights into the Topology and the Formation of a Genuine pp&#963; Bond: Experimental and Computed Electron Densities in Monoanionic Trichlorine [Cl3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the 3c&#8211;4e bond of a symmetric trichlorine anion [Cl]&#8722; was characterized by experimental charge density investigations and compared to two asymmetric cases. Quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations for both periodic crystals and isolated molecules/ions flank those studies. There appears to be a smooth transition from the asymmetric to the symmetric compound.







Abstract
So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe3EtCl][Cl3], 1, tetramethylammonium trichloride [NMe4][Cl3], 2, and tetrapropylammonium trichloride [NnPr4][Cl3], 3, are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl3]&#8722; anions as well as into the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl&#8722; anion.

Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EtCl][Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, tetramethylammonium trichloride [NMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and tetrapropylammonium trichloride [NnPr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions as well as into the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mild C&#8211;C Bond Formation via Lewis Acid Catalyzed Oxetane Ring Opening with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mild C&#8722;C bond formation processes via ring&#8208;opening of oxetanes by soft carbon nucleophiles are described. These allow access to useful 1,n&#8208;oxygenated molecules and heterocycles.







Abstract
Mild oxetane opening by soft carbon nucleophiles has been developed for efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. In the presence of LiNTf2 or TBSNTf2 as catalyst, silyl ketene acetals were found to be effective nucleophiles to generate a wide range of highly oxygenated molecules, which are key substructure in natural products like polyketides. Furthermore, intramolecular oxetane opening by a styrene&#8208;based carbon nucleophile via a Prins&#8208;type process was also achieved with Sc(OTf)3 as catalyst, leading to efficient formation of the useful 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[b]oxepine skeleton.

         <title>Evidence of a Phenolic Pool as a Key Intermediate for Zeolite&#8208;Catalyzed Lignin Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first real&#8208;time experimental observation and speciation of a phenolic pool is reported. The phenolic pool, which features equidistant grouping&#8208;distribution patterns, originates from the repolymerization of monomeric units and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke.







Abstract
The phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during the catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture on a molecular level due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and lowly volatile phenolic oligomers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we report the online detection and structural identification of a phenolic pool by utilizing in&#8208;situ atmospheric&#8208;pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through repolymerization of monomers with an equidistant group pattern and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.

         <title>Atomically precise preorganization of open metal sites on gold nanocluster with high catalytic performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of gold nanoclusters with surface open sites are crucial for practical applications in catalysis. We have developed a &#8220;surface geometric mismatch&#8221; strategy by using mixed ligands of different type of hindrance. When bulky phosphine Ph 3  P and planar dipyridyl amine (Hdpa) are simultaneously used, the steric repulsion between the ligands will reduce the ligand coverage of gold clusters, therefore the coordinative unsaturation of gold atoms is attained. A well&#8208;defined access granted gold nanocluster [Au 23  (Ph 3  P) 10  (dpa) 2  Cl](SO 3  CF 3  ) 2  ( Au 23  , dpa = dipyridylamido) has been successfully synthesized. Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au 23  has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Furthermore, this cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This atomically precise cluster stays intact after the catalytic reaction, demonstrating its excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.</dc:description>

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective modification of proteins is a burgeoning field and serves as an invaluable tool for the precise analysis of proteins structures and functions in complicated cellular environments or the innovation of protein therapeutics with improved features. Besides the widely&#8208;reported single modification of proteins, site&#8208;selective dual functionalization has stood out, as the incorporation of two distinct functionalities greatly enriches the structural and functional diversities of protein therapeutics. The resultant protein bioconjugates combine the advantages of the active biomolecules and up to two synthetic functionalities such as drugs, imaging reagents and polymers. In this way, dual chromophore modified protein bioconjugates shed light into protein trafficking and folding in their native environment or dual modified protein therapeutics provide new avenues for bioimaging, biosensing, and cancer therapy. This review aims to give readers a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this field. First, recent developments in the methodologies for dual modification of proteins are discussed. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photocatalysis, small organic molecules are converted into desired products using light responsive materials, electromagnetic radiation, and electron mediators.&#160; Substitution of low molecular weight reagents with redox active functional materials may increase the utility of photocatalysis beyond organic synthesis and environmental applications.&#160; Guided by the general principles of photocatalysis, we designed in the current study hybrid nanocomposites composed of n&#8208;type semiconducting potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), and p&#8208;type conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the redox active substrate. Electric conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite, possessing optimal K&#8208;PHI content, is reversibly modulated combining a series of external stimuli ranging from visible light under inert conditions and to dark conditions under an O  2  atmosphere.&#160; Using a conductive polymer as the redox active substrate, allows studying the photocatalytic processes mediated by semiconducting photocatalysts through electric conductivity measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Behaviour of novel smart surfactants in stabilizing pH&#8208;responsive emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Newly structured pH&#8208;responsive smart surfactants (abbreviated as N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N, n=14, 16) were synthesized by connecting a tertiary amine group at the end of the hydrophobic chain in alkyl trimethylammonium bromides. In neutral and alkaline media, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N behaves as a normal cationic surfactant and can stabilize conventional emulsions alone, as well as Pickering emulsions and novel oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions together with oppositely and similarly charged nanoparticles, respectively. In acidic media however, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;N is turned to a strongly hydrophilic Bola type surfactant N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  due to formation of the amine salt, which is an inferior emulsifier either when used alone or together with charged nanoparticles resulting in demulsification. Specifically, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the whole aqueous phase can be recycled many times triggered by pH. We thus offer a new protocol towards designing and synthesizing newly structured and recyclable smart surfactants, and specifically make it a green process to prepare various temporarily stable emulsions which are often applied in emulsion polymerization, heterogeneous catalysis and oil transportation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanostructures: Surface Defects for Morphology&#8208;Driven Enhanced Semiconductor SERS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors have recently become attractive candidate substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, exhibiting good semiconductor&#8208;based SERS sensing for a wider variety of application scenarios. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose that surface defects play a vital role in the magnification of the SERS performances of 2D semiconductors. As a prototype material, ultrathin WO  3  nanosheets is used to demonstrate that surface defect sites and resulting increased charge&#8208;carrier density can induce strong charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the substrate&#8208;molecule interface, thereby improving the sensitivity of the SERS substrate by 100 times with high reproducibility. Further work with other metal oxides suggests the reduced dimension of 2D materials can be advantageous in promoting SERS sensing for multiple probe molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Designable Al32&#8208;oxo Clusters with Hydrotalcite&#8208;like Structures: Snapshots of Boundary Hydrolysis and Optical Limiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrolysis of earth&#8208;abundant Al(III) has implications in mineral mimicry, geochemistry and environmental chemistry. The design and synthesis of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are important in modern chemistry due to their extensively optical applications. To study the hydrolysis and NLO properties, herein the assembly of Al(III) ions with &#960; conjugated carboxylate ligands were carried out. As a result, a series of Al32&#8208;oxo clusters with hydrotalcite&#8208;like cores and &#960; conjugated shells were isolated. Thanks to the accurate X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, the boundary hydrolysis snapshots that occur at equatorial unsaturated coordination sites of Al(III) ions are discovered. The charge distribution analysis and theoretical DFT calculations further supported proposed boundary substitution idea. Z&#8208;scan experiment results showed that the Al32&#8208;oxo clusters possess significant reverse saturable absorption (RSA) response with the minimal normalized transmittance up to 29%, indicating they are suitable candidates for optical limiting (OL) materials. This work is conducive to understanding the hydrolysis of Al(III) but also provides insight into the layered materials who also have strong boundary activity at the edges or corners.</dc:description>

         <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/H 2  CO/HCONH 2  clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed, and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/HCONH 2  clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved in non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization Provides a Function&#8208;Integrated System for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water oxidation (2H  2  O &#8594; O  2  + 4H  +  + 4e  &#8722;  ) is a key reaction for obtaining the&#160;protons and electrons required to produce chemical energy from abundant source. In&#160;nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst, so&#8208;called&#160;the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). In the OEC, several amino acid residues&#160;surrounding the catalytic center act as hole transporter, and greatly contribute for&#160;promoting the efficiency of the reaction. In other words, the catalytic center surrounded&#160;by hole transporters is essential to achieve efficient water oxidation. However, in the&#160;artificial systems, there is no example of the water oxidation system which has a&#160;catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Here, we present a facile strategy to&#160;integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters into one system. Electrochemical&#160;polymerization of a tetranuclear cobalt cubane complex with carbazole moieties&#160;afforded the polymer&#8208;based material (  Poly&#8208;1  ) with hole&#8208;transporting biscabazole&#160;moieties. Poly&#8208;1 was confirmed to exhibit excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and&#160;catalyze water oxidation with high faradaic efficiency and a low overpotential. Control&#160;experiments revealed that the catalytic activity was almost suppressed in the absence&#160;of biscarbazole moiety, which indicates the importance of the integration of catalytic&#160;center and hole transporters. The present study provides a novel strategy for

constructing efficient molecule&#8208;based systems for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Role Reductase from Phytosterols Catabolism Enables the Efficient Production of Valuable Steroid Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;androstenedione (4&#8208;AD) and progesterone (PG) are two of the most important precursors for synthesis of steroid drugs, however their current manufacturing processes suffer from low efficiency and severe environmental issues. In this study, we decipher a dual&#8208;role reductase (mnOpccR) in the phytosterols catabolism, which engages in two different metabolic branches to produce the key intermediate 20&#8208;hydroxymethyl pregn&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3&#8208;one (4&#8208;HBC) through a 4&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;CoA (3&#8208;OPC&#8208;CoA) and 2&#8208;e reduction of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;pregnene&#8208;20&#8208;carboxyl aldehyde (3&#8208;OPA), respectively. Inactivation or overexpression of mnOpccR in the  Mycobacterium neoaurum  can achieve exclusive production of either 4&#8208;AD or 4&#8208;HBC from phytosterols. By utilizing a two&#8208;step synthesis, 4&#8208;HBC can be efficiently converted to PG in a scalable manner (100 gram scale). This study deciphers a pivotal biosynthetic mechanism of phytosterol catabolism and provides very efficient production routes of 4&#8208;AD and PG.</dc:description>

         <title>Deeply Cycled Sodium Metal Anodes at Low Temperature and Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling high&#8208;performing alkali metal anodes at low temperature and lean electrolyte conditions is critical for the advancement of next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and improved safety. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;ionic liquid composite electrolyte to tackle the problem of dendrite growth of metallic sodium anode at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled at 2 mA/cm&#178;&#160;with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50 mAh/cm&#178;&#160;for 500 hours at &#8722;20 &#176;C at lean electrolyte (1.0 &#181;L/mAh) condition. Using the composite electrolyte, full cells with Na&#8323;V&#8322;(PO&#8324;)&#8323;&#160;as cathode and sodium metal as anode are demonstrated with a high capacity retention of 90.7% after 1,000 cycles at 2C at &#8722;20 &#176;C. The sodium&#8208;carbon dioxide batteries also exhibit a reversible capacity of 1,000 mAh/g&#160;over 50 cycles at varied temperatures from &#8722;20 to 25 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Bile Acid Tethered Docetaxel&#8208;based Nanomicelles Mitigate Tumor Progression through Epigenetic Changes.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we describe the engineering of sub&#8208;100 nm nanomicelles (DTX&#8208;PC NMs) derived from phosphocholine derivative of docetaxel (DTX)&#8208;conjugated lithocholic acid (DTX&#8208;PC) and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;tethered lithocholic acid. Administration of DTX&#8208;PC NMs decelerate tumor progression and increase the mice survivability compared to Taxotere (DTX&#8208;TS), the FDA&#8208;approved formulation of DTX. Unlike DTX&#8208;TS, DTX&#8208;PC NMs do not cause any systemic toxicity and slow the decay rate of plasma DTX concentration in rodents and non&#8208;rodent species including non&#8208;human primates. We further demonstrate that DTX&#8208;PC NMs target demethylation of CpG islands of Sparcl1 (a tumor suppressor gene) by suppressing DNA methyltransferase activity, and increase the expression of Sparcl1 that leads to tumor regression. Therefore, this unique system has the potential to improve the quality of life in cancer patients, and can be translated as a next&#8208;generation chemotherapeutic.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Here we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability. The ease, low cost, and potential scalability of the semi&#8208;confined strategy makes these hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOF microreactors as promising candidates for diverse biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The photoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have a critical impact on the performance of quantum dot&#8208;sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Currently, I&#8722;III&#8722;VI group QDs have become the mainstream light&#8208;harvesting materials in high&#8208;performance QDSCs. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve satisfactory efficiency for light&#8208;harvesting, charge extraction, and charge collection simultaneously in QDSCs. Herein, we design and prepare Zn0.4Cu0.7In1.0SxSe2&#8722;x (ZCISSe) quinary alloyed QDs by cation/anion co&#8208;alloying strategy. The critical photoelectronic properties of target QDs, including bandgap, conduction band energy level, and density of defect trap states, can be conveniently tailored. Experimental results demonstrate that the ZCISSe quinary alloyed QDs can achieve an ideal balance among light&#8208;harvesting, photogenerated electron extraction, and charge collection efficiencies in QDSCs compared to its single anion or cation quaternary alloyed QD counterparts. Consequently, the quinary alloyed QDs boost the certified efficiency of QDSCs to 14.4%, which is a new efficiency record for liquid&#8208;junction QD solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Here we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on  t&#8208;  butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Seven&#8208;step Synthesis of All&#8208;nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular cages self&#8208;assembled via imine condensation in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly via imine condensation in aqueous media has been considered as a formidable task, due to the labile nature of imine in the presence of water. Here, by taking advantage of multivalence and ligand preorganization, a set of basket&#8208;shaped triscationic cage molecules are self&#8208;assembled in high yields as the predominant products in both water and organic solvent, by condensing a hexaformyl and bisamine. These cage products especially the chiral ones are rather stable or inert in aqueous solution, i.e., no decomposition was observed upon performing dilution, precipitation, or exposed to competitive amines or aldehydes. Such water&#8208;compatible nature allows the hosts to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic guests. The chiral cage  S  &#8208;  2  3+  is capable of selectively binding and distinguishing one of two enantiomers, opening up opportunities for applications such as chiral compound separation. Chiral narcissistic self&#8208;sorting and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effect are observed in the cage formation, when two amino precursors are involved in self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Multiplexed Activity Profiling of Synthetic Acylphloroglucinol Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse synthetic acylphloroglucinol scaffolds have been produced by unprecedented cyclizations and rearrangements in formic acid, a cation&#8208;stabilizing and nucleophilic solvent for alkenes and carbonyls. Multiplexed activity profiling (MAP) was used to evaluate multiple biological readouts at single&#8208;cell resolution to decipher true hits from assay interference. This synthesis combined with MAP reveals the pharmacological potential of novel chemotypes produced by diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis.







Abstract
Reported here are novel formic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated rearrangements of dearomatized acylphloroglucinols to access a structurally diverse group of synthetic acylphloroglucinol scaffolds (SASs). Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) optimized orbital and stereochemical analyses shed light on the mechanism of these rearrangements. Products were evaluated by multiplexed activity profiling (MAP), an unbiased platform which assays multiple biological readouts simultaneously at single&#8208;cell resolution for markers of cell signaling, and can aid in distinguishing genuine activity from assay interference. MAP identified a number of SASs that suppressed pS6 (Ser235/236), a marker for activation of the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways. These results illustrate how biomimetic synthesis and multiplexed activity profiling can reveal the pharmacological potential of novel chemotypes by diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Selective Transformation of Nickel&#8208;Bound Formate to CO or C&#8722;C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali&#8208;Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deceptively simple proton abstraction from nickel&#8208;bound formate not only prepares the resulting CO22&#8722; unit for the release of CO in contact with electrophiles but opens up unique complex reaction schemes including reduction of nickel(II) to nickel(I) and coupling of CO2 units to give oxalate and mesoxalate. Mesoxalate formation from individual CO2 units is so far unprecedented.







Abstract
The complexes [LtBuNi(OCO&#8208;&#954;2O,C)]M3[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBuNiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3)2], feature a NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; core surrounded by Lewis&#8208;acidic cations (M+) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni&#8722;OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+, the {[K3[N(SiMe3)2]2}+ shell around the Ni&#8722;CO22&#8722; entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3)2] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBuNiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBuNiI(&#956;&#8208;OOCH)NiILtBu]K and [LtBuNi(C2O4)NiLtBu]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2C&#8208;CO2&#8208;CO2]4&#8722;) ligands.

         <title>Reductive Arylation of Amides via a Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Coupling and Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic intermolecular addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide&#8208;carbonyl carbon in a single operational step is reported. The method relies on nickel catalysis and enables the conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation cascade process.







Abstract
We report a means to achieve the addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide carbonyl carbon in a single operational step. Our method takes advantage of non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal catalysis and allows for the facile conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a one&#8208;pot Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation process. This study is anticipated to promote the development of new transformations that allow for the conversion of carboxylic acid derivatives to functional groups bearing stereogenic centers via cascade processes.

         <title>Chemistry of Chitosan Aerogels: Three&#8208;Dimensional Pore Control for Tailored Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitosan aerogels and freeze&#8208;dried gels&#8212;these fascinating bio&#8208;derived materials, with tailored porous structures and otherwise inaccessible functionalities, recently emerged from the biomedical field into the realm of materials science and chemistry. Chitosan aerogels are a hot topic in academic research, but what are the barriers to industrial production and commercialization?







Abstract
Chitosan is an abundant biopolymer derived from food waste with attractive properties, particularly its high biocompatibility and easy chemical processability. Here, we review the rapidly expanding literature on chitosan&#8208;based porous materials with a focus on the gelation mechanisms, the three&#8208;dimensional multiscale structural control, and the diverse chemical functionality not accessible by other biopolymers. The properties vary widely: from supercritically dried, mesoporous chitosan aerogels to very light, freeze&#8208;dried macroporous scaffolds. Porous chitosan displays impressive performance at the laboratory scale, but the highly (meso)porous nature amplifies not only the beneficial functionality of chitosan, but also its drawbacks, resulting in serious barriers to industrialization. In order to facilitate technology transfer, we critically discuss the practical feasibility of chitosan aerogels in potential applications compared to conventional and other biopolymer&#8208;based porous or nonporous materials.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes with Cobalt Homoenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for highly atom&#8208;economical, efficient, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes promoted by an easily accessible Co complex was developed. This protocol is the first example of introduction of a wide range of Co homoenolates generated from ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropanols to the cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Catalylic diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with Co&#8208;homoenolate generated in&#8197;situ from ring&#8208;opening of easily accessible cyclopropanols promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such a process represents the unprecedented and direct introduction of a wide range of functionalized alkyl groups without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents onto the cyclopropane motif, affording multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in up to 99&#8201;% yield with &gt;95:5 dr and 98:2 er. Functionalization of the products delivered enantioenriched cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1): Sowing Seeds in the Fields of Chemistry and Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;amino acid cyclic peptide SFTI&#8208;1 is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable prototypic peptide and has planted seeds for thought in a growing number of fields. This Review surveys the applications of SFTI&#8208;1 in the design of protease inhibitors that have blossomed since its discovery, and the new shoots that have recently sprouted in the areas of pharmaceutical design, synthetic chemistry, and molecular biology.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;derived cyclic peptides have proven to be a vast source of inspiration for advancing modern pharmaceutical design and synthetic chemistry. The focus of this Review is sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1), one of the smallest disulfide&#8208;bridged cyclic peptides found in nature. SFTI&#8208;1 has an unusual biosynthetic pathway that begins with a dual&#8208;purpose albumin precursor and ends with the production of a high&#8208;affinity serine protease inhibitor that rivals other inhibitors much larger in size. Investigations on the molecular basis for SFTI&#8208;1&#8242;s rigid structure and adaptable function have planted seeds for thought that have now blossomed in several different fields. Here we survey these applications to highlight the growing potential of SFTI&#8208;1 as a versatile template for engineering inhibitors, a prototypic peptide for studying inhibitory mechanisms, a stable scaffold for grafting bioactive peptides, and a model peptide for evaluating peptidomimetic motifs and platform technologies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Conformational Changes in Self&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Stranded Aromatic Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected conformational changes involving a global concerted rearrangement of the structure have been evidenced in large multistranded aromatic sheets. Increasing foldamer size thus gives access to new and defined conformational trajectories.







Abstract
The orchestration of ever larger conformational changes is made possible by the development of increasingly complex foldamers. Aromatic sheets, a rare motif in synthetic foldamer structures, have been designed so as to form discrete stacks of intercalated aromatic strands through the self&#8208;assembly of two identical subunits. Ion&#8208;mobility ESI&#8208;MS confirms the formation of compact dimers. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals the existence of two distinct conformational dimeric states that require large changes to interconvert. Molecular dynamics simulation validates the stability of the two conformations and the possibility of their interconversion.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Azolation Strategy for Site&#8208; and Chemo&#8208;Selective Labeling of Proteins with Mass&#8208;Sensitive Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;step azolation strategy allows the site&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective labeling of the N&#8208;terminus of proteins with mass&#8208;sensitive probes. This method is tolerant to a variety of proteins and is applied for the N&#8208;terminal tagging of proteolytic fragments in the digested complex mixture in one&#8208;pot, under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins in a site&#8208;selective manner leads to many advances in various scientific fields. The major challenges with conventional N&#8208;terminal bioconjugation techniques are the lack of universal sequence compatibility and poor mass&#8208;detection sensitivity of the resulting bioconjugates. This approach efficiently analyzes proteolytic fragments and native proteins in a complex mixture. Multiple chemical steps are usually required for the site&#8208;selective synthesis of bioconjugates with enhanced mass&#8208;detection sensitivity. We present a single&#8208;step, versatile strategy for the selective modification of protein N&#8208;termini with mass boosters. The chemical tag enhances the peptide detection by multiple orders thus leading to the unambiguous analysis of the resulting bioconjugates. We demonstrate that tagging proteolytic fragments with mass sensitivity probes in a complex mixture improves the detection of resulting bioconjugates.

         <title>Precise Distance Measurements in DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Dimers and Sandwich Complexes by Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order G&#8208;quadruplex structures such as dimers and sandwich complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex binders are investigated with pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy. Incorporated Cu(pyridine)4 complexes allow precise intermolecular Cu2+&#8208;Cu2+ distance measurements and reveal new binding motifs. High rigidity of the transition metal&#8208;based spin labels results in unprecedentedly narrow peaks in the distance distributions.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes show a pronounced tendency to form higher&#8208;order structures, such as &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers and aggregates with aromatic binding partners. Reliable methods for determining the structure of these non&#8208;covalent adducts are scarce. Here, we use artificial square&#8208;planar Cu(pyridine)4 complexes, covalently incorporated into tetramolecular G&#8208;quadruplexes, as rigid spin labels for detecting dimeric structures and measuring intermolecular Cu2+&#8211;Cu2+ distances via pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy. A series of G&#8208;quadruplex dimers of different spatial dimensions, formed in tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail or head&#8208;to&#8208;head stacking mode, were unambiguously distinguished. Measured distances are in full agreement with results of molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, intercalation of two well&#8208;known G&#8208;quadruplex binders, PIPER and telomestatin, into G&#8208;quadruplex dimers resulting in sandwich complexes was investigated, and previously unknown binding modes were discovered. Additionally, we present evidence that free G&#8208;tetrads also intercalate into dimers. Our transition metal labeling approach, combined with pulsed EPR spectroscopy, opens new possibilities for examining structures of non&#8208;covalent DNA aggregates.

         <title>How Oxygen Binding Enhances Long&#8208;Range Electron Transfer: Lessons From Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interprotein electron&#8208;transfer (ET) mechanism between lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was deciphered by multiscale simulations. Our simulations show that I)&#8197;the specific ET pathway involves water molecules; II)&#8197;the long&#8208;range ET is enhanced by exothermic oxygen binding; III)&#8197;enhanced ET is spin&#8208;regulated and favors the quartet state over the doublet state.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing O2 activation and reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most commonly used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. We also show that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O2, directly leads to LPMO&#8722;CuII&#8722;O2&#8722;, bypassing the formation of the generally assumed LPMO&#8722;CuI species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and might have far&#8208;reaching implications for LPMO catalysis as well as the O2&#8208; or CO&#8208;binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.

         <title>A Coplanar &#960;&#8208;Extended Quinoxaline Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Enabling over 21&#8201;% Efficiency for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Quinoxaline derivatives, featuring with rotatable and chemically fixed thienyl substitutes, are introduced as the core for constructing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based HTM TQ4 achieves the best photovoltaic performance (exceed 21&#8201;%) among planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured dopant&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce. Herein, we improve the performance of dopant&#8208;free HTMs featuring with a quinoxaline core via rational &#960;&#8208;extension. Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs TQ3 and TQ4 show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with TQ3, the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based TQ4 endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. It also shows matched energy levels and high thermal stability for application in PSCs. Planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs employing dopant&#8208;free TQ4 as HTM exhibits power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 21&#8201;% with excellent long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Engineered Coatings via the Assembly of Amino&#8208;Quinone Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coatings and thin films of amino&#8208;quinone networks are prepared on various materials by a co&#8208;assembly strategy using quinones and polyamines. Using different building blocks affords precise control over the structures and properties of the coatings, which can serve as multifunctional reaction platforms to synthesize nanoparticles on surfaces.







Abstract
Engineering coatings with precise physicochemical properties allows for control over the interface of a material and its interactions with the surrounding environment. However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge. Herein, we report a co&#8208;assembly strategy to precisely control the structure and properties (e.g., thickness, adhesion, wettability, and zeta potential) of coatings on various materials (27&#8197;substrates examined) using quinone and polyamine building blocks. By increasing the length of the amine building blocks from small molecule diamines to branched amine polymers, we tune the properties of the films, including the thickness (from ca. 5 to ca. 50&#8197;nm), interfacial adhesion (0.05 to 5.54&#8197;nN), water contact angle (130 to 40&#176;), and zeta potential (&#8722;42 to 28&#8197;mV). The films can be post&#8208;functionalized through the in&#8197;situ formation of diverse nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocrystals. Our approach provides a platform for the rational design of engineered, substrate&#8208;independent coatings for various applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Divergent Synthesis of Monodisperse and Ultra&#8208;Long Bottlebrush Polymers from an Easily Purifiable ROMP Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodisperse bottlebrush polymers with lengths of several &#956;m were synthesized in two steps from a simple norbornene derivative that served as a ROMP monomer and as an ATRP initiator. This divergent synthesis produced bottlebrush polymers with tunable lengths, diameters, and chemical structures. The ultra&#8208;long shape (up to 7&#8197;&#956;m) of the bottlebrush polymer was visualized by AFM.







Abstract
The longest bottlebrush polymers reported so far (up to 7&#8197;&#956;m in length) were synthesized in two steps from a norbornene derivative bearing two 2&#8208;bromoisobutylate moieties (NB). The key to this achievement is the excellent reactivity of NB in ring opening metathesis polymerization, which proceeded in a well&#8208;controlled manner with quantitative conversion of NB for monomer&#8208;initiator ratios ranging up to 10,000. The resultant polymer derived from NB was readily converted to various bottlebrush polymers in a divergent synthetic route by grafting vinyl monomers from the 2&#8208;bromoisobutylate units in NB via atom transfer radical polymerization. The structure of the ultra&#8208;long bottlebrush polymer was directly observed using atomic force microscopy.

         <title>An Electroactive Pure Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Based on a Donor&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Acceptor Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry has been demonstrated for the design of electroactive pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymers, whose PLEDs achieve a promising EQE of 9.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
An electroactive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymer has been demonstrated based on a characteristic donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry. Compared with the donor&#8211;acceptor reference, the inserted oxygen atom between donor and acceptor can not only decrease hole&#8208;electron orbital overlap to suppress the charge transfer fluorescence, but also strengthen spin&#8208;orbital coupling effect to facilitate the intersystem crossing and subsequent phosphorescence channels. As a result, a significant RTP is observed in solid states under photo excitation. Most noticeably, the corresponding polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) reveal a dominant electrophosphorescence with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 9.7&#8201;%. The performance goes well beyond the 5&#8201;% theoretical limit for typical fluors, opening a new door to the development of pure organic RTP polymers towards efficient PLEDs.

         <title>Going Platinum to the Tune of a Remarkable Guanine Quadruplex Binder: Solution&#8208; and Solid&#8208;State Investigations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel platinum complex, stacking onto guanine quadruplex faces with very high affinity, is described. With a strong tolerance for various quadruplex topologies and good selectivity for quadruplex vs. duplex structures, it provides a unique platform for further evolution, facilitated by the solved solid&#8208;state structure with telomeric DNA.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplex recognition has gained increasing attention, inspired by the growing awareness of the key roles played by these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures in cellular regulatory processes. We report here the solution and solid&#8208;state studies of a novel planar platinum(II) complex that is easily assembled from a simple ligand, and exhibits notable binding affinity for guanine quadruplex structures, while maintaining good selectivity for guanine quadruplex over duplex structures. A crystal structure of this ligand complexed with a telomeric quadruplex confirms double end&#8208;capping, with dimerization at the 5&#8242; interface.

CAAC precursors 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindole 1 and 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindolium tetrafluoroborate 2BF4 have been prepared and oxidatively added to [M(PPh3)4] (M=Pd, Pt). Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pd(PPh3)4] in toluene at 25&#8201;&#176;C over 4&#8197;days to yield complex cis&#8208;[3]BF4 featuring an N&#8208;ethyl substituted CAAC, two cis&#8208;arranged phosphines and a chloro ligand. Compound trans&#8208;[3]BF4 was obtained from the same reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C over 1&#8197;day. Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pt(PPh3)4] to give cis&#8208;[4]BF4. The neutral indole derivative 1 adds oxidatively to [Pt(PPh3)4] to give trans&#8208;[5] featuring a CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom has been protonated with py&#8901;HBF4 to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand. The PdII complex trans&#8208;[7]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand was obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction from 1 and [Pd(PPh3)4] in the presence of py&#8901;HBF4.

         <title>Recent Advances in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;Heteroatom Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions under Mild Conditions via Facilitated Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of C&#8208;heteroatom bonds represents an important type of bond&#8208;forming reaction in organic synthesis and often provides a fast and efficient access to privileged structures found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemical and materials. In contrast to conventional Pd&#8208; or Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings under high&#8208;temperature conditions, recent advances in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom formations under mild conditions are particularly attractive from the standpoint of sustainability and practicability. The generation of Ni  III  and excited Ni  II  intermediates facilitate the reductive elimination step to achieve mild cross&#8208;couplings. This minireview provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for mild C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations highlights the developments in   photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving SET and energy transfer processes; photoexcited nickel cataylsis; electro and nickel dual catalysis; heterogeneous photoredox and nickel dual catalysis involving graphitic carbon nitride (mpg&#8208;CN), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs); as well as more conventional zinc and nickel dual catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Berkelic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a concise&#160;total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;berkelic acid in eight linear steps. This synthesis features a Catellani reaction/oxa&#8208;Michael cascade for the construction of the isochroman scaffold, a one&#8208;pot deprotection/spiroacetalization operation for the formation of tetracyclic core structure, and a late&#8208;stage Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling for the introduction of the lateral chain. Notably, four stereocenters are established from a single existing chiral center with excellent stereocontrol during the deprotection/spiroacetalization process. Stereocontrol of the intriguing deprotection/spiroacetalization process is supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Criegee Intermediates Beyond Ozonolysis: Recent Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>After more than 70 years of discovery, &#8220;Criegee intermediates&#8221; (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates, playing an important role in the mechanistic context of chemical synthesis, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and, most importantly, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation as well as atmospheric chemistry. This report summarizes key aspects of CIs (from the mechanism of formation e.g. via ozonolysis of alkene and photolysis method employing diiodo&#8208; and diazo compounds to their electronic structures and chemical reactivity), highlights most recent findings and some landmark results of gas&#8208;phase kinetics, and detection/measurements. The recent progress in synthetic and mechanistic studies in CIs chemistry provide a guide to illustrate the possibilities for further investigations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Group 14&#8208;15 Metalates As Model Compounds For Doped Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping and alloying are valuable tools for modifying and enhancing the properties and performance of lead halide perovskites. However, the effects of heterovalent doping with Sb  3+  and Bi  3+  cations are still a matter of current investigation. Due to the different charge of the dopants compared to the constituting Pb  2+  ions, a simultaneous creation of defects is unavoidable and the influence of these defects and the actual metal substitution become entangled. Here, we present the first 14&#8208;15 iodido metalates, (BED)  4  PbE  2  I  16  (BED&#160;=&#160;  N  &#8208;benzylethylenediammonium; E = Sb (  1  ), Bi (  2  )), which are model compounds for doped lead iodide perovskites and display surprisingly low bandgaps of 2.01 (  1  ) and 1.88 eV (  2  ). Quantum chemical investigations show that this stems from a good electronic match between the PbI  6  and EI  6  units of the compounds. Our results provide a model system for doped perovskites, but also represent the first examples of a promising new class of metal halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino effect: gold electrocatalyzing lithium reduction to accelerate nitrogen fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green production of NH  3  , especially Li&#8208;mediate electrochemical N  2  reduction reaction (NRR) in non&#8208;aqueous solutions, is attracting thronging research interest. Controversies on NRR mechanism greatly impedes its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst.  In&#8208;situ  XRD for the first time witnessed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated NRR spontaneously. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0%, and NH  3  yield was as high as ~50 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  . Our research proved that the key step of Li&#8208;mediate non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction, and offered a novel electrocatalyst design method for Li reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>A C&#8208;S&#8208;C linkage&#8208;triggered ultrahigh nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon and identification of active site in triiodide reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient chemical synthesis route, with an aim of reaching an ultrahigh nitrogen (N)&#8208;doping level in carbon materials, is greatly significant because it can provide a platform, where the type and amount of N dopant can be tuned over a wide range, to enable the desired materials with optimal activity.  For the first time, we innovatively propose a C&#8208;S&#8208;C linkage&#8208;triggered confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy for the high&#8208;efficiency  in situ  N&#8208;doping into carbon matrix and an ultrahigh doping level up to 13.5 at%, which is close to the theoretical upper limit (15.2 at%) is realized at a high carbonization temperature of 1000  o  C. Specifically, the pyridinic N is dominant with a maximum percent of 48.7 %. By using I  3  &#8208;  reduction as a demo, the resultant NCM&#8208;5 exhibits the best activity with a power conversion efficiency of 8.77 %. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated a pyridinic N site&#8208;dependent activity that the amount of active sites increases with the increase of pyridinic N, and the carbon atom adjacent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinic N at the armchair edge acts as the most favorable site for the adsorption of I  2  molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Superseding &#946;&#8208;Diketiminato Ligands: An Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Imine Ligand Stabilizes the Exhaustive Series of B=X Boranes (X = O, S, Se, Te)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the C=X bond (X = O, S, Se, Te) in ketones and their heavier chalcogen analogues is an established structural entity, carbon&#180;s neighbor element boron reluctantly forms the respective B=X moieties, which has stimulated the quest for such species in the past few years. Based on the partial success achieved in this area by means of the N,N&#180;&#8208;chelating &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand (HNacNac), we present a new amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm), which gives rise to the isolation of an exhaustive series of Lewis acid free, monomeric chalcogeno B=X boranes with documented &#960;&#8208;bond character between boron and the chalcogen. The chalcogenobo&#8208;ranes are isoelectronic and isolobal the respective ketones. The chemical behavior of the oxoborane (B=O) strongly resembles the classical carbonyl reactivity in C=O bonds as demonstrated by four typical textbook examples including imine and ketal formation. The improved stability provided by the HAmIm ligand system arises (i) from the formation of more stable five&#8208;membered boron chelates vs. the six&#8208;membered NacNac analogues and (ii) from the incorporation of an imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine moiety providing enhanced &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation. We, therefore, propose that the new HAmIm ligand class may supersede the widely employed NacNac system in certain applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Amino Acid Functionalized Phenazine Flow Batteries with Long Lifetime at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow battery is a promising electrochemical technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Here we report a biomimetic, ultra&#8208;stable AORFB utilizing an amino acid functionalized phenazine (AFP). A series of AFPs with various commercial amino acids at different substituted positions were synthesized and studied. 1,6&#8208;amino acid substituted phenazines display much higher stability during cycling when compared to 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;substituted AFPs. Mechanism investigations reveal that the reduced 2,7&#8208; and 1,8&#8208;AFPs tend to tautomerize and lose their reversible redox activities, while 1,6&#8208;AFPs possess ultra&#8208;high stability both in their oxidized and reduced states. By pairing 3,3'&#8208;(phenazine&#8208;1,6&#8208;diylbis(azanediyl))dipropionic acid (  1,6&#8208;DPAP  ) with ferrocyanide at pH 8 with 1.0 M electron concentration, this flow battery exhibits an OCV of 1.15 V and an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.5% per year. These results show the importance of molecular engineering of redox&#8208;active organics for robust redox&#8208;flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric materials, equipping a striking bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), have shown great potential for the next generation photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. However, further applications of conventional ferroelectric materials are hindered by their poor performance. The family of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics combining fascinating polarization and striking semiconducting properties presents significant possibilities. Herein, through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C  6  H  5  CH  2  NH  3  )  2  CsPb  2  Br  7&#160;  (  BCPB  ) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (  P  s  ) of 6.5 &#956;C/cm  2  and high Curie temperature up to 425 K. Meanwhile,  BCPB  shows splendid BPVE properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A/cm  2  ), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;10  5  ); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO  3  . Particularly, the unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of  P  s  and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 10  8  polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of  BCPB  in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. As a pioneering work, it offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8208;70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic esterification reactions under aqueous conditions are not common, as most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity.&#160;This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR),&#160;an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg  2+  , and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from&#160;  Mycobacterium marinum  can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH 10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as&#160;acyltransferase and lipase,&#160;CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen, with an isolated yield of 32%. The CAR esterification reported here offers a new method for green esterification under high water content conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on Living Cell Surface via Bio&#8208;Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. In this work, we develop a new bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy for in&#8208;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization reaction, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8208;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. Moreover, it can augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. By using this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be in&#8208;situ synthesized on the living cell surface, which paves a new way for modulating cell functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Discrete Metal&#8208;Organic Cages into Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal&#8208;organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell&#8208;fate specification. We demonstrate that the hierarchical coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of adamantane&#8208;functionalized M  12  L  24  MOC (Ada&#8208;MOC), and the host&#8208;guest interaction of Ada&#8208;MOC with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. Importantly, the HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The strategy of designing the HAS of MOC could be easily extended to other metallosupramolecules to create soft&#8208;matter nanostructures for advanced biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Docking of Cu(I) and Ag(I) in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8208;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate Cu(I) and Ag(I) with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of Cu(I) and Ag(I) were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59 cm3 cm&#8208;3 at 298 K and 0.2 bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs. It also gave up to 100% improvement of the dynamic separation performance in comparison to pristine MOF&#8208;303. This metalation strategy represents a new strategy for engineering MOFs to give high&#8208;performance gas separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating lattice oxygen at twisted surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystal for efficient and durable catalytic CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well&#8208;defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at continuously&#8208;twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 &#176;C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well&#8208;defined active structures confined at the surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;responsive Phytic&#8208;acid Nickel Biomimetic Complex Anchored on Carbon Nitride for Highly Efficient Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency, for example by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum. Herein, we report the design and realization of a robust molecular&#8208;semiconductor photocatalytic system (MSPS) consisting of an earth&#8208;abundant phytic&#8208;acid nickel (PA&#8208;Ni) biomimetic complex and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The MSPS exhibits an outstanding activity at &#955; = 940 nm with high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8%, particularly &#955; &gt; 900 nm, as it outperforms those all state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art near&#8208;infrared (NIR) hybrid photocatalysts without adding of any noble metals reported thus far. Moreover, the optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM 1.5G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum&#8208;assisted PCN. This work sheds light on feasible avenues to prepare highly active, stable, cheap and NIR&#8208;harvesting photosystems toward sustainable and scalable solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Wrapping of Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly relies on the ability of smaller and discrete entities to spontaneously arrange into more organized systems by means of the structure&#8208;encoded information. Here we show that the design of the media can play a role even more important than the chemical design. It not only determines the self&#8208;assembly pathway, at a single&#8208;component level, but in a very narrow solvent composition, a supramolecular homo&#8208;aggregate can be non&#8208;covalently wrapped by a second component that possess different crystal lattice. Such process has been followed in real time by confocal microscopy thanks to the different emission colours of the aggregates formed by the two isolated Pt(II) complexes. This coating is reversible and controlled by the media composition. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular simulations based on coarse&#8208;grained (CG) models allowed the understanding of the properties displayed by the different aggregates. Such findings can open a new way to construct hierarchical supramolecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Control of Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling and Charge Transfer in Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Ru(IV) Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of Ru  IV  halides are presented here;  A  2  RuCl  6  and  A  2  RuBr  6  , where  A  is K, NH  4  , Rb or Cs. We show that the optical properties and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) behaviour can be tuned through changing the  A  cation and the halide. Within a series, the energy of the ligand to metal charge&#8208;transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger  A  cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature&#8208;dependent due to a non&#8208;magnetic ground state with  J  eff  = 0 caused by SOC. Ru&#8211;  X  covalency and, consequently, the delocalization of metal  d  &#8208;electrons result in systematic trends of the SOC constants due to variations in the  A  cation and the halide anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;Ion Conductivity in Superadamantanoid Lithium Thioborate Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium thioborates are promising fast Li&#8208;ion conducting materials, with similar properties to their lithium thiophosphate counterparts that have enabled the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion batteries. By comparison, thioborates have scarcely been developed, however, offering new space for materials discovery.&#160; Here we report a new class of lithium thioborate halides that adopt a so&#8208;called supertetrahedral adamantoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions and halide anions within interconnected 3D structural channels. Investigation of the structure using single&#8208;crystal XRD, neutron powder diffraction, and neutron PDF reveals significant lithium and halide anion disorder. The phases are non&#8208;stoichiometric, adopting slightly varying halide contents within the materials. These new superadamantanoid materials exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4 mS&#183;cm  &#8208;1&#173;  , which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water&#8208;solubility&#160;and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Installation of a carbanionic substituent, that is strongly stabilised by two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (Tf = SO  2  CF  3  ) groups, into several fluorescence dyes including boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), fluoresceins, and aminocoumarins has been achieved by the 2,2&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylation reaction of the dye frameworks with highly electrophilic Tf  2  C=CH  2  , followed by neutralisation with NaHCO  3  . Despite the contradiction between water&#8208;solubility and lipophilicity, the carbanion&#8208;decorated dyes thus obtained showed significant enhancement of not only water&#8208;solubility but also lipophilicity. This work clearly demonstrates that the fluorinated, highly stabilised carbanionic substituent is a new option for controlling the macroscopic property of chemical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of urease, a Ni&#8208;enzyme: the reactivity of a key thiol with mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted catechols elucidated by kinetic, structural and theoretical studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urease is a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme able to catalyse the conversion of urea to ammonia and carbamate. Urea, the most used soil nitrogen fertiliser worldwide, is thus rapidly hydrolysed into species of nitrogen that can be taken up by plants, a function that, while essential, might also significantly decrease the efficiency of this process due to the release of gaseous species of nitrogen into the atmosphere, contributing to the green&#8208;house effect and to air pollution. Moreover, urease is also a virulence factor for ureolytic bacterial human pathogens that affect the health and livelihood of millions of people, especially, but not only, in developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. For these reasons, strategies for the efficient inhibition of urease activity by molecules that interact with the enzyme and counterbalance its negative effects must be pursued. Here, the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerism    is   widely observed in chemistry but it has scarce   ly been identified in crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of A  2  B  2   type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;TetPB) which have the para&#8208;, meta, and ortho&#8208;substituted isomeric structures, for the direct construction of isomeric frameworks. Interestingly, both kagome (  kgm  ) and monoclinic square (  sql   ) framework isomers are produced from either p&#8208;TetPB (C  2h  symmetry) or m&#8208;TetPB (C  2v  symmetry) by simply changing reaction solvents, while their isomeric structures are unambiguously characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational simulation, microscopy, and sorption isotherm measurements. In contrast, only  sql  frameworks was formed for o&#8208;TetPB (C  2v  symmetry), irrespective of reaction solvents   .   These results disclose a unique feature in the framework structural formation, i.e. the geometry of monomers directs and dominates the lattice growth process while the solvent plays a role in the perturbation of chain growth pattern. The isomeric frameworks exhibit highly selective adsorption of vitamin B  12  owing to a great difference in their pore shape and size. These results open the possibility of selective crystallization  of COFs  and topological engineering of the polymorphism of 2D organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;promoted self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins on an oxide surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;porphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;coordinative binding of O2 at the active center of a copper&#8208;dependent enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is abundant, it is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes via Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five diverse expanded helicenes was accessed through divergent functionalization and characterized using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), revealing previously inaccessible structural data. Features such as long range &#960;&#8208;stacking, homochiral crystals, and emergent nanometer scale cavities were observed, spanning four different space groups.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Herein, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons&#8212;expanded helicenes&#8212;as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1&#8197;&#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behaviors, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities.

         <title>Directing the Rate&#8208;Enhancement for Hydronium Ion Catalyzed Dehydration via Organization of Alkanols in Nanoscopic Confinements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals stabilization of transition states in smaller&#8208;pore MFI zeolites makes secondary alcohols, 3&#8208;heptanol, and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol more reactive toward hydronium ion catalyzed elimination than in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite. Whereas the stabilization of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state provided by intraporous alcohol for 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol provides an additional stabilization in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite, making hydronium ions in BEA more reactive than in MFI.







Abstract
Alkanol dehydration rates catalyzed by hydronium ions are enhanced by the dimensions of steric confinements of zeolite pores as well as by intraporous intermolecular interactions with other alkanols. The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confinements and the structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Binding of Carbon Dioxide by an Iron Center: Insights from Ultrafast Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots from femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared laser spectroscopy reveal spin&#8208;dependent formation of different binding modes of carbon dioxide to a transition&#8208;metal center. The ultrafast excitation of an iron(III) oxalate precursor complex with ultraviolet pulses releases a neutral carbon dioxide molecule within 500&#8197;fs and generates a nascent iron&#8208;CO2&#8208;primary complex that isomerizes on a picosecond time scale.







Abstract
The influence of the spin on the mode of binding between carbon dioxide (CO2) and a transition&#8208;metal (TM) center is an entirely open question. Herein, we use an iron(III) oxalato complex with nearly vanishing doublet&#8211;sextet gap, and its ultrafast photolysis, to generate TM&#8208;CO2 bonding patterns and determine their structure in&#8197;situ by femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. The formation of the nascent TM&#8208;CO2 species according to [L4FeIII(C2O4)]+ + h&#957; &#8594; [L4Fe(CO2)]+ + CO2, with L4=cyclam, is evidenced by the coincident appearance of the characteristic asymmetric stretching absorption of the CO2&#8208;ligand between 1600&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and that of the free CO2&#8208;co&#8208;fragment near 2337&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On the high&#8208;spin surface (S=5/2), the product complex features a bent carbon dioxide radical anion ligand that is O&#8208;&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound to the metal. In contrast, on the intermediate&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin surfaces, the product exhibits a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound, bent carbon dioxide ligand that has either a partial open&#8208;shell (for S=3/2) or fully closed&#8208;shell character (for S=1/2).

         <title>Activation of the G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Rhodopsin by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules flood the protein core of visual rhodopsin to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state upon light absorption. Binding of a peptide analogue of transducin is coupled to hydration changes in catalytic activation of the G&#8208;protein. The soft membrane matter comprises lipids and water, which interact with rhodopsin in the signaling mechanism to control visual function.







Abstract
Visual rhodopsin is an important archetype for G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors, which are membrane proteins implicated in cellular signal transduction. Herein, we show experimentally that approximately 80 water molecules flood rhodopsin upon light absorption to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state. An influx of mobile water is necessary for activating the photoreceptor, and this finding is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined force&#8208;based measurements involving osmotic and hydrostatic pressure indicate the expansion occurs by changes in cavity volumes, together with greater hydration in the active metarhodopsin&#8208;II state. Moreover, we discovered that binding and release of the C&#8208;terminal helix of transducin is coupled to hydration changes as may occur in visual signal amplification. Hydration&#8211;dehydration explains signaling by a dynamic allosteric mechanism, in which the soft membrane matter (lipids and water) has a pivotal role in the catalytic G&#8208;protein cycle.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low&#8208;Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment, quinacridone (QA), was applied as surface passivation agent for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by solution processing of a soluble QA derivative followed by thermal annealing to convert it into insoluble QA. Passivation with strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, together with the hydrophobicity of QA coating, enabled highly efficient PSCs with remarkable stability.







Abstract
Surface passivation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA) is presented. The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA into insoluble QA. With halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1&#8201;% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9&#8201;% recorded for the unmodified devices. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to greatly enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#176; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#176; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. The stability of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were significantly enhanced, retaining about 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000&#8197;hours storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Rapid Unperturbed&#8208;Tissue Analysis for Intraoperative Cancer Diagnosis Using an Enzyme&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobe a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.







Abstract
Accurate intraoperative tissue identification is critical to tumor surgery. However, conventional methods are labor&#8208; and time&#8208;intensive, which greatly delay the intraoperative decision&#8208;making. Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P displays negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Ag2S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma; meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.

         <title>Breaking the Linear Scaling Relationship by Compositional and Structural Crafting of Ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag Nanoframes for Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;Ag/Au nanoframes were prepared to break the intrinsic scaling relationship of intermediate binding associated with carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) and resulted in very high Faradic efficiencies for ethylene production in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Both the *CO&#8211;*CO coupling and *CO&#8594;*CHO hydrogenation steps were found to be rate&#8208;determining and to steer the reaction towards ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide into high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks offers a promising avenue to liberate the chemical industry from fossil&#8208;resource dependence and eventually close the anthropogenic carbon cycle but is severely impeded by the lack of high&#8208;performance catalysts. To break the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of CO2 reduction reactions, ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag nanoframes were fabricated to decouple the functions of CO generation and C&#8722;C coupling, whereby the former is promoted by the alloyed Ag/Au substrate and the latter is facilitated by the highly strained and positively charged Cu domains. Thus, C2H4 production in an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell occurred with high Faradic efficiencies of 69&#177;5 and 77&#177;2&#8201;%, respectively, as well as good electrocatalytic stability and material durability. In situ IR and DFT calculations unveiled two competing pathways for C2H4 generation, of which direct CO dimerization is energetically favored.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Photoluminescence Tuning in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead Bromide Trimer Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;trapped exciton emission of zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide, (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium), is delicately varied via a high pressure technique. Through the pressure&#8208;induced structural distortion, a clear change of emission color, intense white&#8208;light emission and the corresponding variation in structure&#8211;property relationships are achieved.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides are promising light emitters. However, it is still challenging to accurately design their structures with targeted photoluminescence properties. Herein, high pressure is used to change the self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission of 0D (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium). Under initial compression, the simultaneous contraction and distortion of photoactive [Pb3Br11]5&#8722; vary the equilibrium of STE emissions between different excited states, tuning the emission color from yellow green to cyan. Notably, sufficient structural distortion under continuous compression leads to the formation of more and deeper STE states, exhibiting an unprecedented broadband white&#8208;light emission. This study reveals the structure&#8208;dependent optical properties of 0D hybrid metal halides, providing novel insights into the mechanism of STE emission.

         <title>An Open Microfluidic Chip for Continuous Sampling of Solute from a Turbulent Particle Suspension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open microfluidic chip for aqueous phase sampling from high&#8208;solids content turbulent slurries is demonstrated for mineral processing and pharmaceutical tablet dissolution slurries. The chip's 25&#8197;&#956;m slit dampens turbulence in the outside fluid and allows partial exchange of inner and outer fluids, without entraining microparticles (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;m). The microfluidic flow profile, not size&#8208;exclusion, enables the selective sampling of aqueous phase.







Abstract
High solids content complicates in&#8197;situ analysis of chemical processing, biological suspensions, and environmental streams. In most cases, analytical methods require at least one pre&#8208;treatment step of a small volume of sample before a particle&#8208;free fluid can be analyzed. We have developed a continuous in&#8197;situ sampler that can &#8220;sip&#8221; particle&#8208;free solution from a turbulent high solids content stream (a slurry). An open microfluidic chip with an extended slit opening shields the internal laminar flow from the turbulence outside. Unlike other open chips, our chip does not require close proximity to a solid surface and operates in turbulent environments for hours without maintenance. Two applications are demonstrated: monitoring FeIII in a stirred slurry of mixed ore particles at high solids loading (4&#8201;%wt) and paracetamol tablet dissolution profiles for two different formulations.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric sensing system was designed to achieve the direct potentiometric sensing of analytes based on hydrophilic bioreceptors. The magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven extraction of bioreceptors into polymeric membranes enables label&#8208;free and indicator&#8208;free potentiometric biosensing of a broad range of different target molecules.







Abstract
We report here the concept of a magnetically controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labeling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Staphylococcus aureus, as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria. The proposed general platform can be used for potentiometric biosensing using other hydrophilic bioreceptors.

         <title>A Potent and Selective Janus Kinase Inhibitor with a Chiral 3D&#8208;Shaped Triquinazine Ring System from Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the chemical&#8208;space database GDB4c for novel chiral ring systems led to the design and synthesis of triquinazine and a functionalized analogue showing nanomolar inhibition of Janus Kinases.







Abstract
The generated databases (GDBs) enumerate billions of possible molecules following simple rules of chemical stability and synthetic feasibility. Exploring the GDBs shows that many chiral, 3D&#8208;shaped ring systems, often containing quaternary centers, have never been exploited for drug design. Shown herein is that such ring systems can be useful for medicinal chemistry by using the example of the enantioselective synthesis of triquinazine, a novel chiral piperazine analogue derived from angular triquinane. It is used to design a nanomolar and selective inhibitor of Janus Kinase&#8197;1 and is related to the marketed drug Tofacitinib, which is useful for treating autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Managing Locally Excited and Charge&#8208;Transfer Triplet States to Facilitate Up&#8208;Conversion in Red TADF Emitters That Are Available for Both Vacuum&#8208; and Solution&#8208;Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing phenyl or o&#8208;tolyl groups into different positions of the same acceptor backbone, the lowest triplet energy levels of red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters can be tuned from locally excited triplet (3LEA) to charge transfer triplet (3CT) states, resulting in enhancement of the rates of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and boosting efficiencies in both vacuum&#8208; and solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.







Abstract
Developing red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for high&#8208;performance OLEDs is still facing great challenge. Herein, three red TADF emitters, pDBBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, pDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, and oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, are designed and synthesized with same donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) backbone with different peripheral groups attaching on the A moieties. Their lowest triplet states change from locally excited to charge transfer character leading to significantly enhance reverse intersystem crossing process. In particular, oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ exhibits efficient TADF feature and exciton utilization. It not only achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.1&#8201;% in red vacuum&#8208;processed OLED, but also realize a high EQE of 18.5&#8201;% in a solution&#8208;processed OLED, which is among the best results in solution&#8208;processed red TADF OLEDs. This work provides an effective strategy for designing red TADF molecules by managing energy level alignments to facilitate the up&#8208;conversion process and thus enhance exciton harvesting.

         <title>A Radical Approach to Making Unnatural Amino Acids: Conversion of C&#8722;S Bonds in Cysteine Derivatives into C&#8722;C bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to convert the C&#8722;S bonds in cysteine derivatives into C&#8722;C bonds is reported. This method, which capitalizes on an intramolecular radical substitution reaction on sulfur, demonstrates significant scope and yields various unnatural amino acids.







Abstract
Here we report a general approach to make unnatural amino acids from readily available cysteine derivatives. This method capitalizes on an intramolecular radical substitution process that generates alkyl radicals through C&#8722;S cleavage. The resulting alkyl radicals partook in diverse C&#8722;C bond forming events. These reactions proceed under mild, photocatalytic conditions at room temperature, and can be performed open to air. The utility of these transformations is further demonstrated in the straightforward synthesis of various unnatural amino acids and peptides that are difficult to access previously.

         <title>Oxidizing under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom&#8208;Economy by Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a novel titanocene catalyzed method for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single electron steps. The oxidative addition is constituted by an epoxide opening. A H&#8208;atom transfer to generate a benzylic radical serves as radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as reductive elimination. The reaction&#8208;mechanism was studied by high level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low&#8208;energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity can be deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures. Their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and by steric interactions between the titanocene&#8208;catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. A particularly interesting mechanistical aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.</dc:description>
