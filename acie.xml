         <title>Multifunctional Charge and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Effects of Second&#8208;Sphere Imidazolium Pendants Promote Capture and Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Water Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO  2  RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction.  Fe&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;im(H)  , which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO  2  binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO  2  RR activity by 2,000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (  Fe&#8208;TPP  ). Comparison with mono&#8208;functional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO  2  RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote C&#8211;H Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of  C  &#8208;aryl glycosides in biologically active natural products and approved drugs has long motivated the development of efficient strategies for their selective synthesis. Cross&#8208;couplings have been frequently used, but largely relied on palladium catalyst with prefunctionalized substrates, while ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed  C  &#8208;aryl glycoside preparation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we disclose a versatile ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed  meta&#8208;  C&#8211;H glycosylation to access  meta&#8208;C  &#8208;aryl glycosides from readily available glycosyl halide donors. The robustness of the ruthenium catalysis was reflected by mild reaction conditions, outstanding levels of anomeric selectivity and exclusive  meta&#8208;  site&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Poxin Stable cGAMP&#8208;Derivatives Are Remarkable STING Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>cGAMP is a cyclic A&#8208; and G&#8208;containing dinucleotide second messenger, which is formed upon cellular recognition of foreign cytosolic DNA as part of the innate immune response. The molecule binds to the adaptor protein STING, which induces an immune response characterized by the production of type I interferon and cytokines. The development of STING&#8208;binding molecules with both agonistic as well as antagonistic properties is currently of tremendous interest to induce or enhance antitumour or antiviral immunity on the one hand, or to treat autoimmune diseases on the other hand. To escape the host innate immune recognition, some viruses encode poxin endonucleases that cleave cGAMP. Here we report that dideoxy&#8208;2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cGAMP (  1  ) and analogs thereof, which lack the secondary OH&#8208;ribose groups, form a group of poxin&#8208;stable STING agonists. Despite their reduced affinity to STING, particularly the compound constructed from two A nucleosides, dideoxy&#8208;2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cAAMP (  2  ), features an unusually high antitumour response in mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Heck Reaction of N&#8208;Heteroaryl Halides for the Concise Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Heteroaryl&#8208;substituted Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Heck reaction between  N  &#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic alkenes provides a convenient approach to biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl functionalized heterocycles, yet reactions of this type have been challenging due to strong  N  &#8208;heteroaryl coordination to palladium metal, which causes catalyst poisoning. In this report, an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction between  N  &#8208;heteroaryl halides and heterocyclic olefins is established, leading to a variety of &#945;&#8208;heteroaryl substituted heterocycles. The method features an unprecedented broad substrate scope and excellent functional group compatibility. The employment of a sterically bulky P, P=O ligand containing an anthryl moiety is crucial for this transformation due to the coordinative unsaturation facilitated by its steric bulkiness. The asymmetric variant of the Heck reaction is achieved with (  S  )&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS via a cationic palladium pathway, which has enabled an efficient asymmetric synthesis of (  S  )&#8208;nicotine and its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;Atom Sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis are the grand challenges originating from the enormous support materials with complex structures. Through  a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8208;performance correlations, this timely review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis  . The essences and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence their electrocatalysis and the critical needs for their future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate their practically widespread utilization in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines are important organic dyes with a broad applicability in optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and nanomedicine. Currently, phthalocyanines are synthetized in high boiling organic solvents, like dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which is a flammable, corrosive, and bioactive substance, miscible with water and harmful to the environment. Here we show a new solid&#8208;state approach for the high&#8208;yielding synthesis of phthalocyanines, which reduces up to 100&#8208;fold the amount of DMAE. Through systematic screening of solid&#8208;state reaction parameters, carried out by ball&#8208;milling and aging, we reveal the influence of key variables &#8211; temperature, presence of a template, and the amount and role of DMAE in the conversion of tBu phthalonitrile to tetra&#8208;tBu phthalocyanine. These results set the foundations to synthesize these high&#8208;performance dyes through a greener approach, opening the field of solid&#8208;state synthesis to a wider family of phthalocyanines.</dc:description>

         <title>From Copper to Basic Copper Carbonate: A Reversible Conversion Cathode in Aqueous Anion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reversible electrochemical conversion of commercial bulk copper metal to form basic copper carbonate, Cu2CO3(OH)2, from a saturated aqueous electrolyte comprising 4.5&#8201;m K2CO3 and 9&#8201;m KOH, demonstrating high capacity, fast rate capability, and relatively stable cycle life is reported. The salt electrode consisting of Cu, K2CO3, and KOH renders this anion&#8208;hosting electrode a cathode for rocking&#8208;chair batteries.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries that use anions and cations as charge carriers represent a promising energy&#8208;storage technology. However, an uncharted area is to explore transition metals as electrodes to host carbonate in conversion reactions. Here we report the reversible conversion reaction from copper to Cu2CO3(OH)2, where the copper electrode comprising K2CO3 and KOH solid is self&#8208;sufficient with anion&#8208;charge carriers. This electrode dissociates and associates K+ ions during battery charge and discharge. The copper active mass and the anion&#8208;bearing cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of 664&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 299&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, and relatively stable cycling in a saturated mixture electrolyte of K2CO3 and KOH. The results open an avenue to use carbonate as a charge carrier for batteries to serve for the consumption and storage of CO2.

         <title>Mild Acidosis&#8208;Directed Signal Amplification in Tumor Microenvironment via Spatioselective Recruitment of DNA Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based strategy is developed for spatially&#8208;selective amplification of acidic signals in the extracellular milieu of tumors. Amplified imaging of the tumor microenvironment with improved sensitivity was achieved by acidity&#8208;responsive engineering of the cell surface with DNA receptors for controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers.







Abstract
DNA biotechnology offers intriguing opportunities for amplification&#8208;based sensitive detection. However, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled manipulation of signal amplification for in situ imaging of the tumor microenvironment remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based strategy that can spatial&#8208;selectively amplify the acidic signal in the extracellular milieu of the tumor to achieve specific imaging with improved sensitivity. The strategy, termed mild acidosis&#8208;targeted amplification (MAT&#8208;amp), leverages the specific acidic microenvironment to engineer tumor cells with artificial DNA receptors through a pH (low) insertion peptide, which permits controlled recruitment of fluorescent amplifiers via a hybridization chain reaction. The acidosis&#8208;responsive amplification cascade enables significant fluorescence enhancement in tumors with a reduced background signal in normal tissues, leading to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. These results highlight the utility of MAT&#8208;amp for in situ imaging of the microenvironment characterized by pH disequilibrium.

         <dc:description>
The use of a dimeric silver trifluoroacetate template, has facilitated a &#8220;rim&#8208;differentiated&#8221; pillar[6]arene to be isolated successfully from a mixture containing eight constitutional isomers. This macrocycle exhibits interesting conformational adaptation toward guest molecules in the solid state.







Abstract
A &#8220;rim&#8208;differentiated&#8221; pillar[6]arene (RD&#8208;P[6]) was obtained successfully, with the assistance of a dimeric silver trifluoroacetate template, among eight different constitutional isomers in a direct and regioselective manner. The solid&#8208;state conformation of this macrocycle could switch from the 1,3,5&#8208;alternate to a truly rim&#8208;differentiated one upon guest inclusion. This highly symmetric RD&#8208;P[6] not only hosts metal&#8208;containing molecules inside its cavity, but also can form a pillar[6]arene&#8208;C60 adduct through co&#8208;crystallization on account of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The development of synthetic strategies to desymmetrize pillararenes offers new opportunities for engineering complex molecular architectures and organic electronic materials.

         <title>S,O&#8208;Ligand Promoted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers has been realized by a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) and an S,O&#8208;ligand. The reaction proceeds with a broad range of aryl ethers. For the first time, unsymmetrical meta&#8208;diarylation of aryl ethers was accomplished using a novel norbornene. The isolation of palladium intermediates provides insight to the mechanism.







Abstract
Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation processes provides new retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Here, we report a new catalytic system based on palladium/norbornene and an S,O&#8208;ligand for the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aryl ethers that significantly outperforms previously reported systems. We demonstrate the unique ability of this system to employ alkoxyarene substrates bearing electron donating and withdrawing substituents. Additionally, ortho&#8208;substituted aryl ethers are well tolerated, overcoming the &#8220;ortho constraint&#8221;, which is the necessity to have a meta&#8208;substituent on the alkoxyarene to achieve high reaction efficiency, by enlisting novel norbornene mediators. Remarkably, for the first time the monoarylation of alkoxyarenes is achieved efficiently enabling the subsequent introduction of a second, different aryl coupling partner to rapidly furnish unsymmetrical terphenyls. Further insight into the reaction mechanism was achieved by isolation and characterization of some Pd&#8208;complexes&#8212;before and after meta C&#8722;H activation&#8212;prior to evaluation of their respective catalytic activities.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu+ via Strong Electronic Interaction for Selective and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong electronic interactions between hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and Cu2O protect the Cu&#8722;O bonds against electron attack through the transfer of accumulated electrons from Cu2O to h&#8208;BN. This effect stabilizes the active Cu+ species during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Copper oxide&#8208;based materials effectively electrocatalyze carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). To comprehend their role and achieve high CO2RR activity, Cu+ in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu2O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu+. The C2H4/CO ratio increased 1.62&#8208;fold in the CO2RR with Cu2O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu2O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu2O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h&#8208;BN receives partial electron density from Cu2O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO2RR and stabilizing the Cu+ species during long&#8208;term electrolysis. The well&#8208;retained Cu+ species enhanced the C2 product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu2O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal&#8208;valence&#8208;state&#8208;dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.

To comprehend their role and achieve high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR activity, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in copper oxides must be stabilized. As an electrocatalyst, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanoparticles were decorated with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets to stabilize Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO ratio increased 1.62-fold in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;BN compared to that with Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed strong electronic interactions between the two components in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;BN, which strengthens the Cu&#8722;O bonds. Electrophilic h-BN receives partial electron density from Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, protecting the Cu&#8722;O bonds from electron attack during the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and stabilizing the Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species during long-term electrolysis. The well-retained Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species enhanced the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity and improved the stability of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;BN. This work offers new insight into the metal-valence-state-dependent selectivity of catalysts, enabling the design of advanced catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Electrophilic Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles catalyzed by a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) is reported. The reaction proceeds by asymmetric 1,6&#8208;addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines to deliver atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles in good yields and with excellent ee values.







Abstract
Reported here is the first catalytic atroposelective electrophilic amination of indoles, which delivers functionalized atropochiral N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylaminoindoles with excellent optical purity. This reaction was furnished by 1,6&#8208;nucleophilic addition to p&#8208;quinone diimines. Control experiments suggest an ionic mechanism that differs from the radical addition pathway commonly proposed for 1,6&#8208;addition to quinones. The origin of 1,6&#8208;addition selectivity was investigated through computational studies. Preliminary studies show that the obtained 3&#8208;aminoindoles atropisomers exhibit anticancer activities. This method is valuable with respect to enlarging the toolbox for atropochiral amine derivatives.

         <title>Bipolar Magnetic Molecules for Spin&#8208;Polarized Electric Current in Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method to manipulate electron spin orientation in single molecule devices by electrical gating is reported. The realization of such a function is based on a special class of molecules, named bipolar magnetic molecules (BMMs), which are characterized by their unique energy level arrangement, i.e. HOMO and LUMO come from two different spin channels.







Abstract
Electrical control of spin transport at single molecule level is highly desired for molecular nanospintronics. By exploiting magnetic bistability of spin crossover complexes, the magnitude of spin polarization can be modulated. However, efficiently controlling the direction of spin polarization at single molecule level is still challenging. Here, we propose a general method to flip the transport electron spin simply by electrical gating in single molecule devices based on bipolar magnetic molecules (BMMs), of which the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) come from different spin channels. Thus, when the device's Fermi level is reversibly adjusted approaching either HOMO or LUMO by changing the polarity of the applied voltage gate, a 100&#8201;% spin polarized current with switchable spin direction is achievable. The proposed method is verified by the calculated electronic and transport properties of 9 potential transition metal coordination BMMs.

         <title>Sustainable Afterglow Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Materials Generated Using Natural Phenolics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable organic afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime is a particularly attractive phenomenon but remains difficult to achieve. Here, we prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime up to 934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from natural phenolics has seldom been reported yet this is essential for the development of sustainable afterglow RTP materials. With this research, we have prepared sustainable afterglow RTP materials (GA@SA) with a lifetime of up to &#8776;934.7&#8197;ms by embedding gallic acid (GA) within a Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked sodium alginate (SA) matrix. Theoretical simulations indicate that the restricted carbonyl moieties of the GA and H&#8208;type aggregates of GA in a SA matrix promoted the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of GA and induced afterglow emission. Moreover, afterglow RTP emission could be produced by embedding different types of natural phenolics such as, tannic acid, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid into Ca2+&#8208;crosslinked networks of SA. As an illustration of potential applications, GA@SA was used to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeit afterglow clothing and paper. This work provides an innovative method for the activation of long&#8208;lived afterglow RTP from sustainable phenolics.

Four ketoreductases (KREDs) were identified for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides. KRED311 and KRED349 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;O bond with opposite absolute configurations via chemoenzymatic cascades from thiophenols/thiols and &#945;&#8208;haloketones/alcohols. KRED253 and KRED384 catalyse the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;S bond with opposite enantioselectivities by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic &#945;&#8208;thioaldehydes.







Abstract
Chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides are an important class of organic compounds which find broad application in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein we describe the development of novel biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic methods for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides by exploiting ketoreductase (KRED) enzymes. Four KREDs were discovered from a pool of 384 enzymes identified and isolated through a metagenomic approach. KRED311 and KRED349 catalysed the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;O bond with opposite absolute configurations and excellent ee values by novel chemoenzymatic and biocatalytic&#8208;chemical&#8208;biocatalytic (bio&#8208;chem&#8208;bio) cascades starting from commercially available thiophenols/thiols and &#945;&#8208;haloketones/alcohols.

Phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable Cu3N and Cu3PdN were obtained. The precursor conversion mechanism is elucidated; oleylamine is oxidized to a primary aldimine and the latter reacts further with oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N.







Abstract
The precursor conversion chemistry and surface chemistry of Cu3N and Cu3PdN nanocrystals are unknown or contested. Here, we first obtain phase&#8208;pure, colloidally stable nanocubes. Second, we elucidate the pathway by which copper(II) nitrate and oleylamine form Cu3N. We find that oleylamine is both a reductant and a nitrogen source. Oleylamine is oxidized by nitrate to a primary aldimine, which reacts further with excess oleylamine to a secondary aldimine, eliminating ammonia. Ammonia reacts with CuI to form Cu3N. Third, we investigated the surface chemistry and find a mixed ligand shell of aliphatic amines and carboxylates (formed in situ). While the carboxylates appear tightly bound, the amines are easily desorbed from the surface. Finally, we show that doping with palladium decreases the band gap and the material becomes semi&#8208;metallic. These results bring insight into the chemistry of metal nitrides and might help the development of other metal nitride nanocrystals.

         <title>Li&#8722;N Interaction Induced Deep Eutectic Gel Polymer Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Li&#8722;N interaction induced 1,2&#8208;dimethylimidazole (DMIm)&#8208;based deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte is reported. The electron&#8208;donating DMIm dissociates LiTFSI well to form a deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE). The incorporation of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) further changes the coordination environment of the Li+ ions. This kind of gel polymer electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability and enables the excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance for Li/LFP cells.







Abstract
As emerging eutectic mixtures, deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) show unique properties for Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, the limited choice and inferior electrode compatibility hinder their further development in LMBs. Herein, we report a new 1,2&#8208;dimethylimidazole (DMIm)&#8208;based deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte induced by Li&#8722;N interaction. We demonstrate that incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) polymer into the DMIm&#8208;based DEE changes the coordination environment of Li+ ions, leading to a high transference number of Li+ ions (0.65) and superior interface stability between the electrolyte and Li anode. The deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte exhibits excellent non&#8208;flammability, high ionic conductivity (1.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), and high oxidation voltage (up to 4.35&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). The Li||LFP cell based on the newly developed deep eutectic gel polymer electrolyte can achieve superior long&#8208;term cycling stability at a wide range of rates.

         <title>Bioinspired Metalation of the Metal&#8208;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 for Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration and Gas&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Three&#8208;Phase Enzymatic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired metalation of the MOF MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 was accomplished by incorporating the electron&#8208;transfer unit of a Rh complex for facilitated photocatalytic NADH regeneration. By immobilizing formate dehydrogenase onto the hydrophobic layer of the membrane, a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface around the enzyme site could be formed for sustained and enhanced formic acid production coupled with in situ generated NADH.







Abstract
Coenzyme NADH regeneration is crucial for sustained photoenzymatic catalysis of CO2 reduction. However, light&#8208;driven NADH regeneration still suffers from the low regeneration efficiency and requires the use of a homogeneous Rh complex. Herein, a Rh complex&#8208;based electron transfer unit was chemically attached onto the linker of the MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2. The coupling between the light&#8208;harvesting iminopyridine unit and electron&#8208;transferring Rh&#8208;complex facilitated the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer for the NADH regeneration with the yield of 66.4&#8201;% in 60&#8197;mins for 5&#8197;cycles. The formate dehydrogenase was further deposited onto the hydrophobic layer of the membrane by a reverse filtering technique, which forms the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid reaction interface around the enzyme site. It gave an enhanced formic acid yield of 9.5&#8197;mM in 24&#8197;hours coupled with the in situ regenerated NADH. The work could shed light on the construction of integrated inorganic&#8208;enzyme hybrid systems for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Highly Selective Carbonylation of CH3Cl to Acetic Acid Catalyzed by Pyridine&#8208;Treated MOR Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into acetic acid via CH3Cl carbonylation over H&#8208;zeolites is reported. A 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) selectivity was obtained over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR at 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. This strategy enables efficient conversion of methane into oxygenates under mild conditions.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to high value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions is of great significance for the commercially viable and sustainable utilization of methane but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for efficiently converting methane to acetic acid via CH3Cl as an intermediate. Up to 99.3&#8201;% acetic acid and methyl acetate (AA+MA) selectivity was achieved over pyridine&#8208;pretreated MOR (MOR&#8208;8) under moderate conditions of 523&#8197;K and 2.0&#8197;MPa. Water, conventionally detrimental to carbonylation reaction over zeolite catalysts, was conducive to the production of AA in the current reaction system. In the 100&#8197;h continuous test with the MOR&#8208;8 catalyst, the average AA+MA selectivity remained over 98&#8201;%. AA was formed by carbonylation of methoxy groups within 8&#8208;membered rings of MOR followed by hydrolysis. This strategy provided an approach for highly efficient utilization of methane to oxygenates under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Porous Organic Salts: Diversifying Void Structures and Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines were self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding to form porous organic salts. This study demonstrates the advantages of diverse porous organic salts, such as all&#8208;organic, extremely facile preparation methods, diverse void structures and environments, and excellent CO2 adsorption properties.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are porous organic materials, in which various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines are regularly self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. POSs exhibit high solubility in highly polar solvents. Therefore, they are prepared via facile recrystallization and exhibit high recyclability. In this study, tetrahedral&#8208;structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs). Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the para&#8208;positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of d&#8208;POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the d&#8208;POSs, which significantly affected their gas adsorption behavior. In particular, the d&#8208;POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO2 adsorption of 182&#8197;mL(STP)&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;atm in all&#8208;organic porous materials.

In this study, tetrahedral-structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-POSs). Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-POSs, which significantly affected their gas adsorption behavior. In particular, the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of 182&#8197;mL(STP)&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;atm in all-organic porous materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Sila&#8208;Adamantane and Its Ensuing Optical Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic insight into the isomerization synthesis of sila&#8208;adamantane enables the regioselective functionalization of sila&#8208;adamantane at its 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;positions. Substitution at the 1&#8208;position of the cluster core significantly impacts optical absorbance relative to exocyclic or 2&#8208;substitution.







Abstract
The first syntheses of functionalized sila&#8208;adamantanes via site&#8208;selective reactions are described. Mechanistic inquiry into the isomerization of sila&#8208;adamantane revealed new approaches for installing halides at the 2&#8208;position of the cluster. Meanwhile, isomerization via Lewis acid catalysts with non&#8208;nucleophilic counteranions provided access to sila&#8208;adamantane on the gram&#8208;scale, enabling us to discover strategies for substituting its 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 7&#8208;positions with identical or distinct functional groups. Optical absorbance and density functional theory studies show that &#963;&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the 1&#8208;position strongly perturb optical absorbance in sila&#8208;adamantane, whereas substituents at the exocyclic and 2&#8208;position are optically inert. As silicon diamondoids are atomically precise models for silicon nanocrystals, our findings suggest that passivation at tertiary surface sites carries an outsized impact on the optical properties of surface&#8208;functionalized Si nanocrystals.

         <title>Embedding Multiphoton Active Units within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Turning on High&#8208;Order Multiphoton Excited Fluorescence for Bioimaging</title>

The galactose&#8208;modified zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework ZTIG, which has high order multi&#8208;photon excited fluorescence properties, can realize NIR&#8208;II excited fluorescent imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescent materials for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging has always been an intractable challenge. In this study, a reasonable strategy guided by theoretical calculations was employed to fabricate a novel high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence (H&#8208;MPEF)&#8208;responsive UiO&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, ZrTc). Strategically, the functionalization of the photonic&#8208;responsive thiazolothiazole&#8208;based organic ligand gave rise to amplified H&#8208;MPEF (four&#8208;photon activity) performance and prolonged excitation wavelength (1550&#8197;nm) of ZrTcI. The results reveal that the extended &#960;&#8208;electron system, enhanced charge transfer, improved dipole moment, and weakened &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions within the MOFs endow them with excellent H&#8208;MPEF performance for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;induced fluorescence imaging. It is an extremely rare report on H&#8208;MPEF bioimaging using MOFs and provide a universal strategy for the fabrication of H&#8208;MPEF&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated the first fast&#8208;scanning potential&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (FSP&#8208;OECT) for in vivo dopamine (DA) sensing, featuring high sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and stability. It was successfully applied for in vivo DA sensing at low basal levels as well as the electrically stimulated release of DA.







Abstract
Developing techniques for the highly sensitive assay of neurotransmitters is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT): for the highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined use of FSP as a gating mode and transconductance (gm) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility, and stability. The FSP&#8208;OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899&#8197;S&#8201;M&#8722;1 and a low limit of detection down to 5&#8197;nM and was validated for in vivo monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.

         <title>Engineering Aptamers with Selectively Enhanced Biostability in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamer sgc8c equipped with an ATP&#8208;responsive protection module, termed ARP&#8208;sgc8c, was designed. ARP&#8208;sgc8c could be selectively protected from nuclease degradation in the tumor microenvironment through specific incorporation along with high&#8208;concentration ATP, while its rapid degradation was maintained in healthy tissues.







Abstract
Aptamers are emerging as promising molecular tools in cancer&#8208;targeted theranostics. Improving their in vivo stability has been a critical issue in promoting clinical translation, but such efforts could lead to more serious side effects resulting from prolonged retention in healthy organs. To address this problem, we developed an environment&#8208;responsive stabilization strategy for the selective enhancement of aptamer biostability in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Briefly, by means of the end extension of an ATP&#8208;responsive protection (ARP) module, the designed aptamer could be protected from nuclease degradation through the specific incorporation of ATP. Based on our in vivo results, this ARP&#8208;aptamer probe was effectively accumulated in tumors via aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition. It showed selectively prolonged tumor retention time, but rapid digestion in healthy organs. Our strategy should provide a new paradigm for the development of organ&#8208;specific nucleic acid&#8208;based imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Asymmetrically Doping a Platinum Atom into a Au38 Nanocluster for Changing the Electron Configuration and Reactivity in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters are prepared by doping one and two Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24.This study provides an opportunity for systematically investigating the electron configuration change of the nanoclusters in the consecutive doping process and shows the order of electrocatalytic activity: Pt1Au37 &gt; Au38 &gt; Pt2Au36.







Abstract
It is an obstacle to precisely manipulate a doped heteroatom into a desired position in a metal nanocluster. Herein, we overcome this difficulty to obtain Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 and Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 nanoclusters via controllably doping Pt atoms into the kernels of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24. We reveal that asymmetrical doping of one Pt atom into either of the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 elevates the relative energy of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) accompanied by one valence electron loss of Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24, compared to Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 with 14 electrons, while symmetrical doping of two Pt atoms into the cores of Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 narrows the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 with two valence electrons less. Consequently, Pt1Au37(SCH2PhtBu)24 shows an electron&#8208;spin&#8208;induced high activity for CO2 electroreduction, whereas Pt2Au36(SCH2PhtBu)24 is least efficient and Au38(SCH2PhtBu)24 has a decent performance.

         <title>A DNA Barcode&#8208;Based Aptasensor Enables Rapid Testing of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Viruses in Swine Saliva Using Electrochemical Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, simple, and reagent&#8208;less dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) was developed using a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). This biosensor demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% using 12 porcine saliva samples with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.







Abstract
Pen&#8208;side testing of farm animals for infectious diseases is critical for preventing transmission in herds and providing timely intervention. However, most existing pathogen tests have to be conducted in centralized labs with sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times of 2&#8211;4&#8197;days. Herein we introduce a test that uses a dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) and a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for rapid on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). The sensor exploits inter&#8208;electrode spacing reduction and active field mediated transport to accelerate barcode movement from electroactive aptamers to the detection electrode, thus expediting assay operation. The test yielded a clinically relevant limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6&#8197;nM (0.37&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1) in saliva&#8208;spiked PEDv samples. Clinical evaluation of this biosensor with 12 porcine saliva samples demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 83&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% with a concordance value of 92&#8201;% at an analysis time of one hour.

         <title>Mesoporous Polyimide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Multiple Redox&#8208;Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Cathodic Li Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with high loading density of redox&#8208;active centers and a mesoporous channel for facile Li+&#8208;ion diffusion has been designed and fabricated, exhibiting one of the best performances among the thus far reported COF&#8208;based cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are gaining increasing attention as renewable cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, COF electrodes reported so far still exhibit unsatisfying capacity due to their limited active site density and insufficient utilization. Herein, a new two&#8208;dimensional polyimide&#8208;linked COF, HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF with multiple redox&#8208;active sites for storing Li+ ions, was designed and fabricated from a new module of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacarboxyl hexaazatrinaphthalene trianhydrides with a 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone linker. HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF possessing excellent stability, good conductivity, and a large pore size of 3.8&#8197;nm enables the stable and fast ion transport. This, in combination with the abundant redox active sites, results in a high reversible capacity of 319&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=358&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) for the HATN&#8208;AQ&#8208;COF electrode with a high active site utilization of 89&#8201;% and good cycle performance, representing one of the best performances among the reported COF electrodes.

         <title>Hydrogen Production and Water Desalination with On&#8208;demand Electricity Output Enabled by Electrochemical Neutralization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange enables utilization of the chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings for hydrogen production with electricity output.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which still needs electricity input. We have realized hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output via an electrochemical neutralization chemistry strategy that couples acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of chemical energy and low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81&#8197;kWh electricity per m3 of hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with a high peak power density up to 85.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 without an external electricity supply.

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;Field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanoplatform is developed as a Mn reservoir that exhibits efficient storage, specific delivery and accurate release of Mn ions for high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy. Such a smart nanoplatform can exert a responsive imaging signal in dual&#8208;mode (T1&#8208; or T2&#8208;weighted) high&#8208;field MRI, which enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of Mn release within the tumor microenvironment and of ferroptosis initiation.







Abstract
Ferroptosis exhibits potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and the lack of reliable imaging for monitoring the ferroptosis process in living systems. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within the tumor to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, produce O2 and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts a responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T1&#8208;/T2&#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to store, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of Various Low&#8208;Bandgap Donor&#8211;Acceptor Alternating Conjugated Polymers via Living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers with various electronic characteristics, including strong donor&#8211;strong acceptor, are synthesized via living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization in a controlled manner. The polymerization also works with a complex quateraryl monomer and allows for one&#8208;pot di(tri)block copolymer synthesis. The resulting polymers have tunable optical and electrochemical properties based on the combination of building units.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate that living Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) using a RuPhos Pd G3 precatalyst is a versatile method for the precision synthesis of various donor&#8211;acceptor alternating conjugated polymers (DA ACPs). First, the living SCTP of biaryl monomers with combinations of both medium to strong A and D were optimized to produce DA ACPs with controlled number average molecular weight (Mn), narrow dispersity (&#208;, 1.05&#8211;1.29), and high yield (&gt;87&#8201;%). Moreover, its expansion to controlled polymerization (Mn=9.2&#8211;40.0&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) of an A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2&#8208;D quateraryl monomer containing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP; strong A) was successful. The living SCTP also enabled the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of various diblock and triblock copolymers. Lastly, the DA ACPs showed tunable optical band gap (Egopt, from 1.29 to 1.77&#8197;eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (from &#8722;5.57 to &#8722;4.75&#8197;eV), while their block copolymers exhibited broad absorption ranges and promising visible light&#8208;harvesting properties.

         <title>&#8220;Sandwich&#8221; Diimine&#8208;Copper Catalysts for C&#8722;H Functionalization by Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst platform for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization has been discovered. &#8220;Sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) complexes catalyze reactions of alkane, ether, and amine C&#8722;H bonds with a large panel of diazo compounds. Additionally, the first metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation by CH2N2 is disclosed. The electrophilicity and extreme steric bulk of these catalysts are likely reasons for their efficiency.







Abstract
We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper(I) catalysts for C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl&#8208;diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp3)&#8722;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, aryldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base&#8208;metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazo compounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Eutectic Electrolyte with Unique Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand new eutectic electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnCl2 has a unique solvation structure and could enable the formation of a Cl&#8208;rich organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase film on a Zn anode, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIB) present great potential in energy storage due to low cost and high safety. However, the poor stability, dendrite growth, and narrow electrochemical window limit their practical application. Herein, we develop a new eutectic electrolyte consisting of ethylene glycol (EG) and ZnCl2 for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lifespan ZIBs. The EG molecules participate in the Zn2+ solvation via coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. Optimizing the ZnCl2/EG molar ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;4) can strengthen intermolecular interactions to form [ZnCl(EG)]+ and [ZnCl(EG)2]+ cations. The dissociation&#8211;reduction of these complex cations enables the formation of a Cl&#8208;rich organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase film on a Zn anode, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with long&#8208;term stability of &#8776;3200&#8197;h. Furthermore, the polyaniline||Zn cell manifests decent cycling performance with &#8776;78&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, and the assembled pouch cell demonstrates high safety and stable capacity. This work opens an avenue for developing eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;safety and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Multifunctional &#960;&#8208;Conjugated P&#8208;Heterocycles Featuring an Internal Ylidic Bond
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple synthesis of P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond is reported. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization (direct arylation) and the strategy is also compatible with the preparation of polyaromatic scaffolds (acenes, helicenes). Molecular engineering allows tuning the optical and redox properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.







Abstract
We report the straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of novel 5&#8208; or 6&#8208;membered P&#8208;heterocycles featuring an internal ylidic bond: P&#8208;containing acenaphthylenes and phenanthrenes. The stability of the compounds tolerates post&#8208;functionalization through direct arylation to introduce electron&#8208;rich/poor substituents and the synthetic strategy is also compatible with the preparation of more elaborate polyaromatic scaffolds such as acenes and helicenes. Using a joint experimental (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical approach, we perform a full structure&#8211;property relationships study on these new platforms. In particular, we show that molecular engineering allows not only tuning their absorption/emission across the entire visible range but also endowing them with chiroptical or non&#8208;linear optical properties, making them valuable dyes for a large panel of photonic or opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Tailored Multivalent Targeting of Siglecs with Photosensitizing Liposome Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach towards optically active biohybrid systems that selectively bind receptors of the sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins (siglecs) family is described. To this end, siglec&#8208;modified supported lipid bilayers act as cell membrane mimics that interact in a multivalent fashion with photosensitizer&#8208;loaded vesicles, showing a potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.







Abstract
The modification of surfaces with multiple ligands allows the formation of platforms for the study of multivalency in diverse processes. Herein we use this approach for the implementation of a photosensitizer (PS)&#8208;nanocarrier system that binds efficiently to siglec&#8208;10, a member of the CD33 family of siglecs (sialic acid (SA)&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectins). In particular, a zinc phthalocyanine derivative bearing three SA moieties (PcSA) has been incorporated in the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), retaining its photophysical properties upon insertion into the SUV's membrane. The interaction of these biohybrid systems with human siglec&#8208;10&#8208;displaying supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) has shown the occurrence of weakly multivalent, superselective interactions between vesicle and SLB. The SLB therefore acts as an excellent cell membrane mimic, while the binding with PS&#8208;loaded SUVs shows the potential for targeting siglec&#8208;expressing cells with photosensitizing nanocarriers.

         <title>Atroposelective Construction of Nine&#8208;Membered Carbonate&#8208;Bridged Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the atroposelective construction of nine&#8208;membered carbonate&#8208;bridged biaryls was achieved through a ring&#8208;expansion process via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediates. This strategy allows the convenient construction of bridged biaryls with broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions. In bioassay studies, several agents showed considerable antiproliferative activity via the mitochondrial&#8208;related apoptosis mechanism.







Abstract
We herein demonstrated an efficient method for the atroposelective construction of nine&#8208;membered carbonate&#8208;bridged biaryls through vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM) intermediates. Diverse products with desirable pharmacological features were synthesized in satisfying yields and good to excellent enantioselectivities. In subsequent bioassays, several agents showed considerable antiproliferative activity via the mitochondrial&#8208;related apoptosis mechanism. Further transformations produced more structural diversity and may inspire new ideas for developing functional molecules.

         <title>An Ultrastable 155&#8208;Nuclei Silver Nanocluster Protected by Thiacalix[4]arene and Cyclohexanethiol for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual C5h&#8208;symmetric silver nanocluster (Ag155) with the highest reported nuclearity was prepared by exploiting the protection of the macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A) and cyclohexanethiol (CySH). This silver nanocluster exhibits excellent stability in solution and photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Thiacalix[4]arenes have emerged as a family of macrocyclic ligands to protect metal nanoparticles, but it remains a great challenge to solve the mystery of their structures at the atomic level, especially for those larger than 2&#8197;nm. Here, we report the largest known mixed&#8208;valence silver nanocluster [Ag155(CyS)40(TC4A)5Cl2] (Ag155) protected by deprotonated cyclohexanethiol (CySH) and macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A). Its single&#8208;crystal structure consists of a metallic core of four concentric shells, Ag13@Ag42@Ag30@Ag70, lined with a organic skin of 40CyS&#8722; and 5TC4A4&#8722; and 2Cl&#8722;. Ag155 manifests an unusual pseudo&#8208;5&#8208;fold symmetry dictated by the intrinsic metal atom packing and the regioselective distribution of mixed protective ligands. This work not only reveals a macrocyclic ligand effect on the formation of a large silver nanocluster, but also provides a new structural archetype for comprehensively perceiving their interface and metal kernel structures.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Mapping of Efficient Chiral Induction by Helicene&#8208;Type Additives in Copolymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A special class of helicene&#8208;type additives, which are straightforward to synthesize in large amounts, induce strong chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films. Advanced chirality&#8208;sensitive microscopy techniques and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods based on transient circular dichroism and transient circularly polarized luminescence reveal the supramolecular origin of the chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We observed efficient induction of chirality in polyfluorene copolymer thin films by mixing with helicene&#8208;type chiral additives based on the dibenzo[c,h]acridine motif. Images obtained from circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) microscopy provide information about the chiral arrangements in the thin films with diffraction&#8208;limited resolution. The CD signal shows a characteristic dependence on the film thickness, which supports a supramolecular origin of the strong chiral response of the copolymer. In particular, we demonstrate the discrimination between films of opposite chirality based on their ultrafast transient chiral response through the use of femtosecond broadband CD spectroscopy and a newly developed setup for transient CPL spectroscopy with 28&#8197;ps time resolution. A systematic variation of the enantiomeric excess of the chiral additive shows that the &#8220;Sergeants and Soldiers&#8221; concept and &#8220;Majority Rules&#8221; are not obeyed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Ultrasensitive Dynamic Wrinkling on Floating Films Induced by Photo&#8208;Orientation of Azopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarized light illumination, a floating azo&#8208;film experiences a wealth of ultrafast wrinkling evolution coupled with unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers that are involved is revealed experimentally for the first time.







Abstract
Ubiquitous surface wrinkling has been well&#8208;studied theoretically and experimentally. How to modulate the stress state of a liquid&#8208;supported system for the unexploited wrinkling capabilities remains a challenge. Here we report a simple linearly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light illumination to spatiotemporally trigger ultrasensitive in situ dynamic wrinkling on a floating azo&#8208;film. The smart combination of the liquid substrate with photoresponsive azo&#8208;moieties leads to the light&#8208;induced ultrafast wrinkling evolution, accompanied by unprecedented sequential wrinkling orientation conversion (from polarization&#8208;parallel to polarization&#8208;perpendicular). The involved different polarization&#8208;dependent sequential photo&#8208;orientation for azo side chains and azo&#8208;grafted main chains of azopolymers is disclosed experimentally for the first time. Meanwhile, programmable dynamic wrinkling with all&#8208;optical switchable surface topographies is available, which has wide application potentials in photoresponsive soft photonics.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Switchable Site&#8208;Selective Alkene Hydroalkylation by Temperature Regulation

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed switchable site&#8208;selective alkene hydroalkylation was developed. The selection of reaction temperatures led to protocols that provide regiodivergent hydroalkylated products starting from a single alkene substrate.







Abstract
Regiodivergent alkene functionalization that produces either regioisomer starting from the same raw materials is desirable. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed switchable site&#8208;selective alkene hydroalkylation. The selection of reaction temperatures leads to protocols that provide regiodivergent hydroalkylated products starting from a single alkene substrate. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;branched protected amines, both of which are important to the fields of pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry. In addition, enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;branched alkylamines can be accessed in a catalytic asymmetric variant. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the formation of a more stable nickelacycle provides the driving force of migration. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of different reduction elimination intermediates are responsible for the switchable site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Tunicamycin&#8197;V and Discovery of a Cytostatic DPAGT1 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck&#8208;type reaction enabled the total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (TN&#8208;V), a nonselective phosphotransferase inhibitor, in just 15 steps from D&#8208;galactal in 21&#8201;% overall yield. The short and high&#8208;yielding synthetic route was also adapted for the synthesis of analogues, thus leading to the discovery of a novel cytostatic tunicamycin analogue, TN&#8208;TMPA, with high DPAGT1 selectivity.







Abstract
A short total synthesis of tunicamycin&#8197;V (1), a non&#8208;selective phosphotransferase inhibitor, is achieved via a B&#252;chner&#8211;Curtius&#8211;Schlotterbeck type reaction. Tunicamycin&#8197;V can be synthesized in 15 chemical steps from D&#8208;galactal with 21&#8201;% overall yield. The established synthetic scheme is operationally very simple and flexible to introduce building blocks of interest. The inhibitory activity of one of the designed analogues 28 against human dolichyl&#8208;phosphate N&#8208;acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1) is 12.5&#8197;times greater than 1. While tunicamycins are cytotoxic molecules with a low selectivity, the novel analogue 28 displays selective cytostatic activity against breast cancer cell lines including a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Syngas to Higher Alcohols via Tandem Integration of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis and Reductive Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst engineering enables the single&#8208;pot integration of solid nanoparticulate and molecular cobalt catalysts in a slurry&#8208;phase tandem Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis/olefin reductive hydroformylation process for a direct and highly selective conversion of syngas (H2/CO) to higher alcohols. The new tandem process contributes to bridging the traditionally dissevered disciplines of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The selective conversion of syngas to higher alcohols is an attractive albeit elusive route in the quest for effective production of chemicals from alternative carbon resources. We report the tandem integration of solid cobalt Fischer&#8211;Tropsch and molecular hydroformylation catalysts in a one&#8208;pot slurry&#8208;phase process. Unprecedented selectivities (&gt;50&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to C2+ alcohols are achieved at CO conversion levels &gt;70&#8201;%, alongside negligible CO2 side&#8208;production. The efficient overall transformation is enabled by catalyst engineering, bridging gaps in operation temperature and intrinsic selectivity which have classically precluded integration of these reactions in a single conversion step. Swift capture of 1&#8208;olefin Fischer&#8211;Tropsch primary products by the molecular hydroformylation catalyst, presumably within the pores of the solid catalyst is key for high alcohol selectivity. The results underscore that controlled cooperation between solid aggregate and soluble molecular metal catalysts, which pertain to traditionally dichotomic realms of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, is a promising blueprint toward selective conversion processes.

The unique synthesis of a boryl&#8208;substituted borole system by means of a 1,1&#8208;hydroboration/1,1&#8208;alkenylboration sequence provided access to the unprecedented 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene class of compounds.







Abstract
The B(C6F5)2&#8208;substituted borole 2&#8901;SMe2 was obtained from the phenyl bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) borane SMe2 adduct (1&#8901;SMe2) by a synthetic sequence containing a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. Subsequent thermolysis at 50&#8201;&#176;C converted it to the bicyclic borenium/borate zwitterion 3&#8901;SMe2. Photolysis of 3&#8901;SMe2 gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative 4&#8901;SMe2, which after ligand exchange with N,N&#8208;dimesitylimidazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt 6. Some unique follow&#8208;up reactions of the unsaturated diboron containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles were investigated.

Photolysis of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which after ligand exchange with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimesitylimidazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1-bora-3-boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. Some unique follow-up reactions of the unsaturated diboron containing six-membered heterocycles were investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Triplet&#8211;Singlet Exciton Interconversion in Narrowband Blue Organoboron Emitters Doped with Heavy Chalcogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;doped polycyclic organoboron emitter exhibits ultrafast triplet&#8211;singlet exciton interconversion ability in addition to strong narrowband blue emission. Its spin&#8208;flip reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate exceeds 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 (100&#8197;million times spin inversion per second), enabling superimposed fluorescence with full exciton utilization. This breakthrough shatters the stereotypical physicochemical views of conventional thermally activated delayed fluorescence limited by slow RISC.







Abstract
Narrowband emissive organoboron emitters featuring the multi&#8208;resonance (MR) effect have now become a critical material component for constructing high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with pure emission colors. These MR organoboron emitters are capable of exhibiting high&#8208;efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by allowing triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). However, RISC involving spin&#8208;flip exciton upconversion is generally the rate&#8208;limiting step in the overall TADF; hence, a deeper understanding and precise control of the RISC dynamics are ongoing crucial challenges. Here, we introduce the first MR organoboron emitter (CzBSe) doped with a selenium atom, demonstrating a record&#8208;high RISC rate exceeding 108&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is even higher than its fluorescence radiation rate. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;flip upconversion process in CzBSe can be accelerated by factors of &#8776;20000 and &#8776;800, compared to those of its oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;doped homologs (CzBO and CzBS), respectively. Unlike CzBO and CzBS, the photophysical rate&#8208;limiting step in CzBSe is no longer RISC, but the fluorescence radiation process; this behavior is completely different from the conventional time&#8208;delaying TADF limited by the slow RISC. Benefitting from its ultrafast exciton spin conversion ability, OLEDs incorporating CzBSe achieved a maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency as high as 23.9&#8201;%, accompanied by MR&#8208;induced blue narrowband emission and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off features.

         <title>PIII&#8208;Directed Late&#8208;Stage Ligation and Macrocyclization of Peptides with Olefins by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C7&#8208;selective alkylation of tryptophan residues has been developed. This method is compatible with internal olefins and represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation is a step&#8208;economical strategy for peptide functionalization. Herein, we report the method of late&#8208;stage peptide ligation and macrocyclization through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of tryptophan residues at the C7 position. This method utilizes a N&#8208;PtBu2 directing group and tolerates various peptide and alkene substrates. Utilizing internal olefins, this study represents the first example of site&#8208;selective peptide C&#8722;H alkylation through deconjugative isomerization. Furthermore, our method provides access to peptide macrocycles with unique Trp(C7)&#8208;alkyl crosslinks and potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Li2S&#8722;Cu Nanocomposite Cathodes Enabled by Kinetically Favored Displacement Interconversion between Cu2S and Li2S</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured Li2S&#8722;Cu composite is fabricated and it is demonstrated that Cu progressively participates in the redox processes and fundamentally alters the redox couple from anion&#8208;type Li2S/S to cation&#8208;type Cu/Cu2S, which leads to a drastically reduced activation potential (2.35&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), superior rate capability, and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
The high activation barrier, inferior rate performance, and short cycling life severely constrain the practical applications of the high&#8208;capacity Li2S cathode. Herein, we fabricate a Li2S&#8722;Cu nanocomposite with a drastically reduced activation potential, fast rate capability, and extraordinary cycling stability even under a practically relevant areal capacity of 2.96&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed experimental investigations aided by theoretical calculations indicate that instead of converting to S8 via troublesome soluble lithium polysulfides, Li2S is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable to react with Cu by the displacement reaction, which alters the redox couple from Li2S/S to Cu/Cu2S, leading to the excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the stability of the composite is demonstrated in the full&#8208;cell configuration consisting of commercial graphite anodes. This work provides an innovative and effective approach to realize highly activated and stable Li2S cathode materials.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;Rearrangement of Porous Organic Cage Membrane for CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competitive CO2 capture in a porous organic cage membrane can be assisted by ionic liquid molecules (e.g., BMIMBF4). Ionic liquid molecules electrostatically induce the crystal&#8208;rearrangement of cage molecules to construct regular nanochannels as well as aiding in situ nanochannel regulation.







Abstract
Porous Organic Cages (POCs) with tunable tailoring chemistry properties and polymer&#8208;like processing conditions are of great potential for molecular selective membranes, but it remains challenging in the assembly of high crystalline POCs with regular nanochannels for effective molecular sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;rearrangement strategy for the design of a POC membrane with heterostructure. Due to electrostatic attraction, ionic liquid molecules induced cage molecules to rearrange into a sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm uniform and defect&#8208;free crystal layer, which displayed competitive CO2 separation performance. The optimized hetero&#8208;structured membrane exhibited an attractive CO2/N2 separation selectivity of over 130, which was superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes, accompanied with excellent long&#8208;term and thermal shock stability. This strategy provides a new inspiration for the preparation of crystal&#8208;rearranged membranes with regular channels for gas molecule sieving.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Layered Lithium Oxides through Cation Vacancies for Enhanced Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beginning with cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2, the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations was studied. The results indicate that lattice oxygen activated by cation vacancies triggered charge disproportionation to form high&#8208;activity Ni4+, resulting in facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.







Abstract
Despite the fact that high&#8208;valent nickel&#8208;based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of the high performance and the structure&#8211;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation&#8208;vacancy controllable LiNiO2 (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO&#8208;2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with excellent stability after the 160&#8197;h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO2 with moderate cation vacancies triggers charge disproportion of the Ni site to form Ni4+ species, facilitating deprotonation in a lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.

         <title>Water Networks Repopulate Protein&#8211;Ligand Interfaces with Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;cooled water molecules block protein motions that impact protein&#8211;ligand interactions. Paired cryo and room&#8208;temperature comparisons of ligand&#8208;bound Hsp90&#945; structures show that water networks and protein conformations are more mobile at room temperature. Revealing such alternate conformational states that are masked by cryo&#8208;cooling provides new insights towards drug discovery.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution crystal structures highlight the importance of water networks in protein&#8211;ligand interactions. However, as these are typically determined at cryogenic temperature, resulting insights may be structurally precise but not biologically accurate. By collecting 10 matched room&#8208;temperature and cryogenic datasets of the biomedical target Hsp90&#945;, we identified changes in water networks that impact protein conformations at the ligand binding interface. Water repositioning with temperature repopulates protein ensembles and ligand interactions. We introduce Flipper conformational barcodes to identify temperature&#8208;sensitive regions in electron density maps. This revealed that temperature&#8208;responsive states coincide with ligand&#8208;responsive regions and capture unique binding signatures that disappear upon cryo&#8208;cooling. Our results have implications for discovering Hsp90 selective ligands, and, more generally, for the utility of hidden protein and water conformations in drug discovery.

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Thermomorphic Multiphasic System for Biocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The applicability of a deep eutectic solvent thermomorphic multiphasic system (DES&#8208;TMS) within biocatalysis was successfully demonstrated. Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was simply recycled using the DES&#8208;TMS. At increased temperatures, the system splits into an aqueous&#8208;enriched and a DES&#8208;enriched phase. In this way, the product and the catalyst were separated in a single unit operation step.







Abstract
The applicability of a thermomorphic multiphasic system (TMS) composed of a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) and an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase change for homogeneous biocatalysis was investigated. A lidocaine&#8208;based DES with the fatty acid oleic acid as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and presented within this study. We tested different additional components to the solvent system and observed a decrease in the cloud point of approximately 0.026&#8201;&#176;C per concentration unit. Distribution studies revealed a clear distribution of the protein in the aqueous buffer phase (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas the hydrophobic substrate and educt accumulated (&gt;95&#8201;%) in the DES&#8208;enriched layer. Finally, a reduction catalyzed by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was performed in a larger&#8208;scale experiment, and the biocatalyst could be recycled by simply removing the DES phase for three recycling runs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Geminal Hydroborative Cyclization of Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the previously known hydroborative cyclizations that add hydrogen and boron to opposite sides of an enyne, the proper choice of a ruthenium catalyst alters this propensity to a new addition mode, geminal hydroborative cyclopropanation. Two possible mechanisms are operative, which are substrate&#8208;dependent based on DFT studies.







Abstract
Disclosed here is the first geminal (gem&#8208;) hydroborative cyclization of enynes. Different from known hydroborative cyclizations, this process adds hydrogen and boron to the same position, leading to a new reaction mode. With [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst, a range of gem&#8208;hydroborated bicyclic products bearing a cyclopropane unit could be rapidly assembled from simple enyne substrates. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the reaction mechanism. Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate&#8208;dependence. 1,6&#8208;Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7&#8208;enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne gem&#8208;(H,B)&#8208;addition to form an &#945;&#8208;boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.

         <title>Restoration of the Immunogenicity of Tumor Cells for Enhanced Cancer Therapy via Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Copper Chaperone Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination strategy for synergistic chemo&#8208;sensitization and conversion of tumor cells into vaccines triggers an intense immune response through copper chaperone inhibition with multifunctional nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin prodrugs and DC_AC50 conjugated to reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Recent progress in studying copper&#8208;dependent targets and pathways in the context of tumor treatment has provided new insights into therapeutic strategies of leveraging copper&#8208;dependent disease vulnerabilities and pharmacological manipulation of intratumor copper transportation to improve chemotherapy. Here, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles loaded with copper chaperone inhibitor DC_AC50 and cisplatin(IV) prodrug. The released DC_AC50 can promote a remarkable accumulation of intracellular cisplatin and copper through inhibition of the Atox1&#8208;ATPase pathways, thereby enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect of cisplatin and inducing significant ROS generation. Excessive ROS then elicits intense endoplasmic reticulin (ER) stress which facilitates the immunogenic cell death (ICD) spurring a sustained immune response. Our study suggests that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated copper chaperone inhibition via DC_AC50 can restore the immunogenicity of tumor cells for enhanced chemotherapy and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Back Cover: Direct Conversion of Syngas to Higher Alcohols via Tandem Integration of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis and Reductive Hydroformylation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 31/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis of solid NaPr&#8208;CoRu@Al2O3 and molecular [HCo(CO)3PR3] catalysts allows the direct conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols. Walter Leitner, Andreas&#8197;J. Vorholt, Gonzalo Prieto et&#8197;al. show in their Research Article (e202201004) that the combination of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch and hydroformylation catalysts generates alcohols from synthesis gas with exceptional selectivity. While the bimodally porous solid catalyst generates 1&#8208;olefins with high efficiency, in situ hydroformylation of olefins to alcohols circumvents secondary hydrogenation and allows to push the alcohol selectivity even further.

         <dc:description>
The reaction path of the Lewis acid catalyzed intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition to form a C3 ammonium enolate is reported by Jan Paradies et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202204378). This transient intermediate rearranges diastereospecifically to the tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;one scaffold. The central structure in the picture represents the transition state of the diastereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift which proceeds with retention of configuration on the migrating carbon center.

Rapid and reagent&#8208;free pathogen tests are urgently needed. In their Research Article (e202204252), Leyla Soleymani, Yingfu Li and co&#8208;workers developed a dual&#8208;electrode electrochemical chip (DEE&#8208;Chip) and a barcode&#8208;releasing electroactive aptamer for rapid on&#8208;farm detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDv). In contrast to current biosecurity surveillance with turnaround times of 2&#8211;4 days, this technology identifies infection with PEDv in pig saliva in one hour with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100&#8201;% and specificity of 83&#8201;%.

         <title>Stepping Out of the Blue: From Visible to Near&#8208;IR Triggered Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are in high demand and have sparked great research interest in the past decade. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We evaluate the pros and cons of each type based on their photochromic properties and conclude with a perspective on how the field may develop in the future.







Abstract
Light offers unique opportunities for controlling the activity of materials and biosystems with high spatiotemporal resolution. Molecular photoswitches are chromophores that undergo reversible isomerization between different states upon irradiation with light, allowing a convenient means to control their influence over the system of interest. However, a significant limitation of classical photoswitches is the requirement to initiate the switching in one or both directions using deleterious UV light with poor tissue penetration. Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are hence in high demand and have attracted keen recent research interest. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We hope to inspire further endeavors in this field, allowing the full potential of these tools in biotechnology and materials chemistry applications to be realized.

Recent advances in photochemical C&#8722;H functionalization reactions using a single metal catalyst to enable sustainable strategies for the functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds under ambient conditions without an external photosensitizer are highlighted in this Minireview. Reaction mechanisms and the role of visible light are described, and future perspectives and challenges to stimulate future research directions in the field of light&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization are discussed.







Abstract
C&#8722;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas in organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecological and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8722;H bonds in organic molecules, however, poses several challenges, and often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal, although it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8722;H functionalization, where a single transition&#8208;metal complex can be used as both the photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8722;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this Minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Heteroatoms Enabled by Trichloroisocyanuric Acid and Potassium Fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative fluorination of various Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds was made significantly more accessible in recent years using potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant. Behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes insight and discussion on discoveries, applications, and opportunities associated with this &#8220;TCICA/KF approach&#8221; are chronicled herein.







Abstract
In synthetic method development, the most rewarding path is seldom a straight line. While our initial entry into pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) chemistry did not go according to plan (due to inaccessibility of reagents such as SF5Cl at the time), a &#8220;detour&#8221; led us to establish mild and inexpensive oxidative fluorination conditions that made aryl&#8208;SF5 compound synthesis more accessible. The method involved the use of potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA)&#8212;a common swimming pool disinfectant&#8212;as opposed to previously employed reagents such as F2, XeF2, HF, and Cl2. Thereafter, curiosity led us to explore applications of TCICA/KF as a more general approach to the synthesis of fluorinated Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds; this, in turn, prompted SC&#8208;XRD, VT&#8208;NMR, computational, and physical organic studies. Ultimately, it was discovered that TCICA/KF can be used to synthesize SF5Cl, enabling SF5 chemistry in an unexpected way.

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although doubted in the past, two &#960;&#8208;electrons are just enough to stabilize five&#8208;membered aromatic compounds that are even stable at room&#8208;temperature, as shown by the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene. This compound is a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths.







Abstract
Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirm its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Complex Peptidyl Nucleoside Antibiotics: Asymmetric De Novo Syntheses of Miharamycin&#8197;B and Its Biosynthetic Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple building blocks were used for the total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor. The key step in the strategy was the de novo construction of the pyranose moiety through Achmatowicz rearrangement. The purine ring was introduced by palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Miharamycins belong to a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique nine&#8208;carbon pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2&#8208;aminopurine moiety. Herein, we report the de novo total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor from 3&#8208;bromofuran and Garner's aldehyde through a modified Achmatowicz reaction. Many challenges were resolved toward the de novo synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B, including the introduction of a dense array of functional groups, the stereoselective construction of consecutive stereocenters, dealing with the variability of the anomeric positions, and promoting site&#8208;selectivity in the cyclization to form the tetrahydrofuran ring. This de novo synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of 3&#8242;&#8208;substituted saccharides, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action, and meets the growing demand for the development of novel antibiotics inspired by miharamycin natural products.

The key step in the strategy was the de novo construction of the pyranose moiety through Achmatowicz rearrangement. The purine ring was introduced by palladium-catalyzed N-glycosylation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miharamycins belong to a class of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics with a unique nine-carbon pyranosyl amino acid core and a rare 2-aminopurine moiety. Herein, we report the de novo total synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B and its biosynthetic precursor from 3-bromofuran and Garner's aldehyde through a modified Achmatowicz reaction. Many challenges were resolved toward the de novo synthesis of miharamycin&#8197;B, including the introduction of a dense array of functional groups, the stereoselective construction of consecutive stereocenters, dealing with the variability of the anomeric positions, and promoting site-selectivity in the cyclization to form the tetrahydrofuran ring. This de novo synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of 3&#8242;-substituted saccharides, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action, and meets the growing demand for the development of novel antibiotics inspired by miharamycin natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sigmatropic [1,5] Carbon Shift of Transient C3 Ammonium Enolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of a new [1,5] sigmatropic rearrangement is described. With the aid of a borane&#8208;based Lewis acid, the transiently generated C3 ammonium enolates undergo a sigmatropic [1,5] shift of benzylic, allylic and propargylic groups to provide access to trans&#8208;configured tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with diastereoselectivity of &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. The reaction is investigated in kinetic, mechanistic and computational experiments.







Abstract
The stereospecific sigmatropic [1,5] carbon shift of C3 ammonium enolates is discovered. According to mechanistic, kinetic and computational experiments, this new rearrangement proceeds via the catalytic generation of a transient C3 ammonium enolate by intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition. This intermediate rapidly undergoes [1,5] sigmatropic carbon migration to furnish the respective tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;4&#8208;ones with excellent diastereoselectivities of d.r. &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 and in 61&#8211;98&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Synthesis of an N&#8208;Heterocylic Boryl&#8208;Stabilized Disilyne and Its Application to the Activation of Dihydrogen and C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first N&#8208;heterocyclic boryl&#8208;stabilized disilyne has been prepared and structurally characterized. The disilyne compound enabled the activation of dihydrogen and the benzylic C&#8722;H bond from toluene without the need for a catalyst, highlighting the unique electronic effects of the boryl group on the properties of low&#8208;valent silicon species.







Abstract
The synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon compounds that enable the activation of small molecules has been of great current interest. Reduction of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryltribromosilane (NHB)SiBr3 (2, NHB=[ArN(CMe)2NAr]B, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with three equiv. of lithium in diethyl ether yielded the NHB&#8208;stabilized disilyne (NHB)Si&#8801;Si(NHB) (3). Disilyne 3 slowly reacted with toluene, leading to the activation of one benzylic C&#8722;H bond and one C=C double bond with the formation of 4. Treatment of 3 with dihydrogen under 1&#8197;atm at room temperature resulted in the exclusive formation of the first boryl&#8208;stabilized 1,2&#8208;dihydrodisilene. Compounds 3&#8211;5 have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which indicated the co&#8208;planarity of the B&#8722;Si&#8722;Si&#8722;B plane with the NHB rings in compounds 3 and 5. DFT calculations indicated the significant &#960; electron delocalization of the Si&#8722;Si multiple bonds to the B&#8722;N bonds in NHB rings.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction through Hydrophobic Microenvironment and Binuclear Cobalt Synergistic Effect in Metallogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallogels based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipids with cobalt ions can be used as catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction presenting high efficiency and good product selectivity. Mimicking the natural lipid bilayer not only provides these soft matter catalysts with a hydrophobic microenvironment and binuclear synergistic effect but also renders them environmentally friendly with recycling and degradable properties.







Abstract
Assemblies that mimic natural lipid bilayers are theoretically efficient for photocatalytic CO2 reduction; however, such an approach has not been yet explored. Herein, metallogels (LG/Nico&#8208;Co) based on the co&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;glutamic acid lipid (LG/Nico) and cobalt ions exhibited excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with 208&#8201;724&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 24&#8197;h and 90&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, or 166&#8201;826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO production within 12&#8197;h and 46&#8201;% CO/H2 selectivity, depending on the water content of the solvent. The alkyl chains of LG/Nico provide a hydrophobic microenvironment for efficient gas transfer, and the assembled bilayers induce a synergistic effect between two adjacent Co ions for catalyzing the CO2 reduction reaction. These architectures present new alternatives for the development of highly efficient photocatalytic soft matter based on the assembly of small amphiphilic molecules.

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of the Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic compositions of nanoclusters can dictate whether their photoluminescence is fluorescence or phosphorescence. This effect is demonstrated with Au5Ag11 and Pt1Ag16 nanoclusters that have comparable structures but different compositions.







Abstract
It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as either fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au5Ag11(SR)8(DPPOE)2 and Pt1Ag16(SR)8(DPPOE)2 with comparable structure features, were synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature&#8212;the Au5Ag11 nanocluster is fluorescent, whereas the Pt1Ag16 nanocluster is phosphorescent. The decay processes of the excited electrons in these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing the mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Equilibria between Aluminium(I) and Aluminium(III): The Formation of Dihydroalanes, Masked Dialumenes and Aluminium(I) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric AlI compound is used as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides. This leads to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. The transient formation of new, previously inaccessible AlI species is demonstrated through reactivity studies and theory.







Abstract
The design of new reductive routes to low oxidation state aluminium (Al) compounds offers the opportunity to better understand redox processes at the metal centre and develop reactivity accordingly. Here, a monomeric AlI compound acts as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides, leading to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. These compounds are formed by a series of equilibrium processes involving AlI, AlII and AlIII species and product formation can be manipulated by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions. The transient formation of monomeric AlI compounds is proposed: this is shown to be energetically viable by computational (DFT) investigations and reactivity studies show support for the formation of AlI species. Importantly, despite the potential for the equilibrium mixtures to lead to ill&#8208;defined reactivity, controlled reactivity of these low oxidation state species is observed.

Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastic degradability and recyclability.







Abstract
Photodegradable, recyclable, and renewable, crosslinked polymers from bioresources show promise towards developing a sustainable strategy to address the issue of plastics degradability and recyclability. Photo processes are not widely exploited for upcycling polymers in spite of the potential to have spatial and temporal control of the degradation in addition to being a green process. In this report we highlight a methodology in which biomass&#8208;derived crosslinked polymers can be programmed to degrade at &#8776;300&#8197;nm with &#8776;60&#8201;% recovery of the monomer. The recovered monomer was recycled back to the crosslinked polymer.

         <title>Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Elimination of Chlorine from a Carbene&#8208;Xanthylium Gold(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex combining an ambiphilic carbene/xanthylium ligand and a gold trichloride supports the efficient green&#8208;light&#8208;induced extrusion of chlorine radicals en route to the corresponding gold(I) complex. The photolability of this gold(III) complex originates from excitation of a carbene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad, the excited state of which challenges the inherent stability of the gold(III) moiety.







Abstract
With the discovery of late transition metal platforms that support clean photoreductive halogen eliminations, we now describe an indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene gold trichloride complex ([7]+) decorated at the 4&#8208;position by a xanthylium unit. This orange complex features a low energy band in the visible part of the spectrum, assigned to the charge transfer excitation of the indazol&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene/xanthylium donor/acceptor dyad. Green&#8208;light irradiation of this complex in the presence of a chlorine trap elicits the clean photoelimination of chlorine radicals, producing the corresponding gold(I) complex. This visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreduction is very efficient, reaching quantum yields close to 10&#8201;%. A neutral analog of [7]+ featuring an anthryl group rather than a xanthylium unit proved to be perfectly photostable, supporting the importance of the xanthylium&#8208;based photoredox unit present in [7]+.

         <title>Umpolung AlaB Reagents for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;Proteogenic Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amino acid synthon in the form of boronoalanine (AlaB) suitable for umpolung peptide/protein functionalization is described. It is demonstrated that AlaB can be incorporated into peptides and proteins, and remains stable under solid&#8208;phase synthesis, native chemical ligation, and radical desulfurization. Furthermore, AlaB is a competent partner in inter(intra)molecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids and functionalized peptides are important motifs in modern drug discovery. Here we report that AlaB can serve as universal building blocks in the synthesis of a diverse collection of modified amino acids, peptides, and proteins. First, we develop the synthesis of AlaB from redox&#8208;active esters of aspartic acid resulting in a series of &#946;&#8208;boronoalanine derivatives. Next, we show that AlaB can be integrated into automated oligopeptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis. AlaB is compatible with common transformations used in preparative peptide chemistry such as native chemical ligation and radical desulfurization as showcased by total synthesis of AlaB&#8208;containing ubiquitin. Furthermore, AlaB reagents participate in Pd&#8208;catalyzed reactions, including C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings and macrocyclizations. Taken together, AlaB synthons are practical reagents to access modified peptides, proteins, and in the synthesis of cyclic/stapled peptides.

         <title>Intramolecular Energy and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Transfer within a BINOL&#8208;Perylene Hetero&#8208;Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) hetero&#8208;cyclophane comprising a chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) dye and a dynamically racemic PBI dye shows quantitative energy and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality transfer among its components, thereby leading to an amplified bright red circularly polarized luminescence from PBI.







Abstract
Multichromophoric macrocycles and cyclophanes are important supramolecular architectures for the elucidation of interchromophoric interactions originating from precise spatial organization. Herein, by combining an axially chiral binaphthol bisimide (BBI) and a bay&#8208;substituted conformationally labile twisted perylene bisimide (PBI) within a cyclophane of well&#8208;defined geometry, we report a chiral PBI hetero&#8208;cyclophane (BBI&#8208;PBI) that shows intramolecular energy and solvent&#8208;regulated chirality transfer from the BBI to the PBI subunit. Excellent spectral overlap and spatial arrangement of BBI and PBI lead to efficient excitation energy transfer and subsequent PBI emission with high quantum yield (80&#8211;98&#8201;%) in various solvents. In contrast, chirality transfer is strongly dependent on the respective solvent as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The combination of energy and chirality transfer affords a bright red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from the PBI chromophore by excitation of BBI.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the intersection of molecular recognition and materials science, a multi&#8208;functional two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) is prepared and applied as a broad&#8208;spectrum adsorbent for the high&#8208;efficiency removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl pollutants.







Abstract
The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen&#8208;bond donors, hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors, and fluorophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the broad&#8208;spectrum affinity. FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.

         <title>Accelerated Degradation of Microplastics at the Liquid Interface of Ice Crystals in Frozen Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally rapid degradation of microplastics (MPs) in frozen solution was discovered. The activity is ascribed to selective generation of singlet oxygen in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals. The findings offer a highly efficient degradation pathway for MPs and shed light on mechanisms of disposal of MPs in nature.







Abstract
Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants in environmental media, and they have raised great concern because they are resistant to degradation and persist in ecosystems. Although numerous advanced technologies have been developed, suitable technologies are still lacking for degradation of widespread MPs in the natural environment. We have discovered that MPs can be degraded exceptionally rapidly in frozen environments. Taking polystyrene (PS) as an example, its degradation rate in ice (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) is surprisingly competitive to most artificial technologies. PS particles are trapped and squeezed to achieve excited state (3PS*) in the narrow space of the liquid layer between ice crystals, which further react with the highly concentrated dioxygen to selectively produce singlet oxygen (1O2). The 1O2 boosts PS oxidation in the liquid layer thus further causing accelerated degradation at freezing temperature. This finding offers a highly efficient pathway for degradation of MPs and it sheds light on an unusual MPs disposal mechanisms in nature.

         <title>Native Ambient Mass Spectrometry of an Intact Membrane Protein Assembly and Soluble Protein Assemblies Directly from Lens Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integral membrane protein assembly Aquaporin&#8208;0 was analysed by native ambient mass spectrometry of eye lens tissue. Membrane protein assemblies were solubilised by detergent micelles. Spatially&#8208;resolved analysis for mapping protein assembly distributions, accurate intact mass determination, and the identification of assemblies approx. 100&#8197;kDa in molecular weight are demonstrated.







Abstract
Membrane proteins constitute around two&#8208;thirds of therapeutic targets but present a significant challenge for structural analysis due to their low abundance and solubility. Existing methods for structural analysis rely on over&#8208;expression and/or purification of the membrane protein, thus removing any links back to actual physiological environment. Here, we demonstrate mass spectrometry analysis of an intact oligomeric membrane protein directly from tissue. Aquaporin&#8208;0 exists as a 113&#8197;kDa tetramer, with each subunit featuring six transmembrane helices. We report the characterisation of the intact assembly directly from a section of sheep eye lens without sample pre&#8208;treatment. Protein identity was confirmed by mass measurement of the tetramer and subunits, together with top&#8208;down mass spectrometry, and the spatial distribution was determined by mass spectrometry imaging. Our approach allows simultaneous analysis of soluble protein assemblies in the tissue.

         <title>Alkyl/Glycosyl Sulfoxides as Radical Precursors and Their Use in the Synthesis of Pyridine Derivatives
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides are shown to be suitable precursors to radicals. Alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, which, upon visible&#8208;light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to give various pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
We report here the use of simple and readily available alkyl sulfoxides as precursors to radicals and their application in the preparation of pyridine derivatives. We show that alkyl sulfoxides, N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salts and fluoride anions form electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes in solution, which, upon visible light irradiation, undergo a radical chain process to afford various pyridine derivatives smoothly. This reaction displays broad scope with respect to both sulfoxides and N&#8208;methoxy pyridiniums. The synthetic versatility of sulfoxides as a handle in chemistry adds to their power as radical precursors. Glycosyl sulfoxides are converted to the corresponding pyridyl C&#8208;glycosides with high stereoselectivities. Computational and experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Novel AgI&#8208;DNA Rod Comprising a One&#8208;Dimensional Array of 11 Silver Ions within a Double Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AgI&#8208;DNA rod comprising a one&#8208;dimensional array of 11 silver ions within a double&#8208;helical structure was obtained by mixing an oligonucleotide and silver ions in appropriate solutions. Furthermore, formations of the rod structure in solutions were determined by UV/Vis, CD, NMR, and mass spectrometry.







Abstract
DNA/RNA duplexes containing metal&#8208;ion&#8208;mediated base pairs (metallo&#8208;base pairs) have potential applications in developing nucleic acid&#8208;based nanodevices and genetic code expansion. Many metallo&#8208;base pairs are formed within duplexes stabilized by Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Recently, the crystal structure of an AgI&#8208;DNA nanowire with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional silver array was determined. Here, we present a new DNA helical wire, the &#8220;AgI&#8208;DNA rod&#8221;, containing an uninterrupted array of 11&#8197;AgI ions. The AgI&#8208;DNA rod consisted of only C&#8208;AgI&#8208;C, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;G, G&#8208;AgI&#8208;5&#8208;bromouracil (BrU), and BrU&#8208;AgI&#8208;BrU metallo base pairs, with no Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. The AgI&#8208;DNA rods were connected by non&#8208;canonical G&#8211;G pairs in crystals. Notably, data from our absorbance, circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the AgI&#8208;DNA rods formed in solution, as well as within crystals.

         <title>Sirtuin&#8208;Derived Covalent Binder for the Selective Recognition of Protein Crotonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering a bacterial sirtuin deacetylase with thiol&#8208;bearing noncanonical amino acids, a selective and robust covalent binder for lysine crotonylation on proteins was developed, and features a unique NAD+ dependency.







Abstract
Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is increasingly recognized as a key protein post&#8208;translational modification. However, selective detection and enrichment of crotonylated proteins remains a challenging task. Herein we present a covalent binder for the selective recognition of protein crotonylation. Based on proximity&#8208;induced crosslinking, a bacterial sirtuin (CobB) was remodeled with genetically installed thiol&#8208;bearing noncanonical amino acids at the Kcr&#8208;interacting site, which subsequently could react with Kcr sites in a unique NAD+&#8208;dependent manner. The covalent binder has been used to selectively recognize crotonylated proteins in extracted histone samples and in fixed cells.

         <title>Metathesis Reactions of a NHC&#8208;Stabilized Phosphaborene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable compounds with a genuine B=P double bond are rare and have limited applications given their protecting groups&#8242; bulky nature. The preparation of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene with a B=P double bond and a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal is reported, which exhibits an unprecedented ability for B=P&#8208;unit transfer reactions, allowing the isolation of B=P&#8208;containing compounds.







Abstract
The BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.

         <title>Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aldehydes and Ketones by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation of aldehydes and ketones via their readily prepared silyl enol ethers has been achieved by dual nickel and photoredox catalysis. This reaction features broad scope and excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalization of ketones and aldehydes has been intensively explored in organic synthesis. The functionalization of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in such carbonyl compounds is less well investigated and developing a general method for their &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation remains challenging. Herein we report a method that uses cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis for the formal &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aldehydes and ketones with (hetero)aryl bromides. The method features mild conditions, remarkable scope and wide functional group tolerance. Importantly, the introduced synthetic strategy also allows the &#946;&#8208;alkenylation, &#946;&#8208;alkynylation and &#946;&#8208;acylation of aldehydes under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that this transformation proceeds through a single electron oxidation/Ni&#8208;mediated coupling/reductive elimination cascade.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Diversity&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydroisoquinolines: Seven&#8208;Step Asymmetric Synthesis of Michellamines&#8197;B and C</title>

         <dc:description>
A modular and step&#8208;economical approach based on a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade has been established for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinolines. This synthetic strategy enabled concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen as well as four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;Disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) is a common heterocyclic structural unit of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. The assembly of this structural unit is not trivial, which constitutes a substantial challenge in the total synthesis of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids and related pharmaceuticals. Herein, we report a modular and convergent method for the rapid assembly of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQ frameworks through a three&#8208;component Catellani reaction and a AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/reduction cascade. With widely available simple aryl iodides, aziridines and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene as the building blocks, this method paves a practical way for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,3&#8208;trans&#8208;disubstituted THIQs. Based on this new method, concise syntheses of an analogue of the new drug mevidalen and four naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been accomplished, demonstrating the broad synthetic utility of this approach.

         <title>Reductive Carbon&#8211;Carbon Coupling on Metal Sites Regulates Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Water Using ZnSe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive carbon&#8211;carbon coupling was used to block H2 evolution in CO2 photoreduction in water. Furfural, one of the biomass platform molecules, adsorbs on Zn&#8208;sites consuming electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, but the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies remains. Therefore, CO was evolved with a CO/H2 ratio of 265&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the gas phase and furfural was upgraded to value&#8208;added hydrofuroin.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) consisting of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements show attractive potentials towards solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. However, the inhibition of hydrogen (H2) production in aqueous solution remains a challenge. Here, we describe the first example of a carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reaction to block the competing H2 evolution in photocatalytic CO2 reduction in water. In a specific system taking ZnSe QDs as photocatalysts, the introduction of furfural can significantly suppress H2 evolution leading to CO evolution with a rate of &#8776;5.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a turnover number (TON) of &gt;7500 under 24&#8197;h visible light. Meanwhile, furfural is upgraded to the self&#8208;coupling product with a yield of 99.8&#8201;% based on the consumption of furfural. Mechanistic insights show that the reductive furfural coupling reaction occurs on surface Zn&#8208;sites to consume electrons and protons originally used for H2 production, while the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies from CO2 remains.

However, the inhibition of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in aqueous solution remains a challenge. Here, we describe the first example of a carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reaction to block the competing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in water. In a specific system taking ZnSe QDs as photocatalysts, the introduction of furfural can significantly suppress H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution leading to CO evolution with a rate of &#8776;5.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a turnover number (TON) of &amp;gt;7500 under 24&#8197;h visible light. Meanwhile, furfural is upgraded to the self-coupling product with a yield of 99.8&#8201;% based on the consumption of furfural. Mechanistic insights show that the reductive furfural coupling reaction occurs on surface Zn-sites to consume electrons and protons originally used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, while the CO formation pathway at surface anion vacancies from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Amides Using Dicarbamoylzincs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfunctional dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn were prepared in THF by treating a mixture of formamides and ZnCl2 with LiTMP (THF, 15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by reacting formamides with TMP2Zn (THF, 25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). These zinc reagents reacted with allylic, benzylic, aryl and alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones providing various amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR data showed a characteristic carbonyl signal at 219.4&#8197;ppm for (Bu2NCO)2Zn.







Abstract
We report a new convenient preparation of dicarbamoylzincs of type (R1R2NCO)2Zn by the treatment of ZnCl2 and formamides R1R2NCHO with LiTMP in THF (15&#8201;&#176;C, 15&#8197;min) or by the reaction of formamides R1R2NCHO with TMP2Zn (25&#8201;&#176;C, 16&#8197;h). This second method tolerates sensitive groups such as an ester, ketone or nitro function. Reaction of these dicarbamoylzincs with allylic, benzylic, aryl, alkenyl bromides, acid chlorides, aldehydes or enones provided various polyfunctional amides in 47&#8211;97&#8201;% yields. 13C NMR characterization of these new carbamoylzinc derivatives is reported.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes enabled by copper hydride and palladium cooperative catalysis was developed. Utilizing readily available carbamoyl chlorides, this method can be applied to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, providing &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields with excellent levels of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of olefins represents a straightforward approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides, but is hampered by the necessity to employ CO gas, often at elevated pressures. We herein describe, as an alternative, an enantioselective hydrocarbamoylation of alkenes leveraging dual copper hydride and palladium catalysis to enable the use of readily available carbamoyl chlorides as a practical carbamoylating reagent. The protocol is applicable to various types of olefins, including alkenyl arenes, terminal alkenes, and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Substrates containing a diverse range of functional groups as well as heterocyclic substructures undergo functionalization to provide &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;chiral amides in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols by Catalytic Asymmetric Hydrolytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 31, August 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols has been developed. This direct catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes gives access to a variety of functionalized silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, including bis&#8208;silanols, in high yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Despite growing progress in the construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols is less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols by the catalytic asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of dihydrosilanes. This practical procedure features ambient reaction conditions, high atom economy, good functional&#8208;group compatibility, and H2 as the only by&#8208;product, and produces a wide range of valuable chiral silanols and bis&#8208;silanols in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cochlearol&#8197;B by an Approach Based on a Catellani Reaction and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled [2+2] Cycloaddition

         <dc:description>
A 14&#8208;step approach to (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. The strategy involves an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation, Catellani reaction, and visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] cycloaddition to rapidly access the core of this natural product. Careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions, and [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;step synthesis of (+)&#8208;cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. This renoprotective meroterpenoid features a unique core structure containing a densely substituted cyclobutane ring with three stereocenters. Our strategy employed an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation in route to the key chromenyl triflate. A subsequent Catellani reaction incorporated the remaining carbon atoms featured in the skeleton of cochlearol&#8197;B. An ensuing visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition closed the cyclobutane and formed the central bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core. Notably, careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions and [4+2] cycloadditions.

         <title>A Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Graphene&#8208;Embedded Photocatalyst with Controllable Activation for Solar Ammonia Fertilizer Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 catalysts showed a remarkable nitrogen fixation apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% under 365&#8197;nm light and high stability as solar nitrogen fertilizer. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and forms effective active sites. Graphene embedding controlled bond breakages and improved photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Currently, nitrogen fertilizers feed half of the global population, but their use is limited by energy consumption and transportation. Therefore, it is important to study photocatalysts for use in solar nitrogen fertilizers. Herein, a new type of graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 (Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) photocatalyst (GSCe) is investigated. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and the formation of active sites by ultraviolet light in water. Moreover, embedding graphene effectively controls activation and improves nitrogen fixation. GSCe exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% and stability under 365&#8197;nm light with solar&#8208;level intensity. GSCe also performed well as a solar ammonia fertilizer for crop cultivation. This investigation opens up opportunities for nitrogen fixation photocatalysts to be used as environmentally friendly solar nitrogen fertilizers.

         <title>resPAINT: Accelerating volumetric super&#8208;resolution localisation microscopy by active control of probe emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Points for accumulation in nanoscale topography (PAINT) allows practically unlimited measurements in localisation microscopy but is limited by background fluorescence at high probe concentrations, especially in volumetric imaging. We present reservoir&#8208;PAINT (resPAINT), which combines PAINT and active control of probe photophysics. In resPAINT, an activatable probe &#8216;reservoir&#8217; accumulates on target, enabling a 50&#8208;fold increase in localisation rate versus conventional PAINT, without compromising contrast. By combining resPAINT with large depth&#8208;of&#8208;field microscopy, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of entire cell surfaces. We generalise the approach by implementing various switching strategies and 3D imaging techniques. Finally, we use resPAINT with a Fab to image membrane proteins, extending the operating regime of PAINT to include a wider range of biological interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[1,2] shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of l  3  &#8208;iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO&#8208;1234yf. We demonstrated that the hypervalent reagent serves as an excellent fluoroalkylation agent for various amines and nitrogen heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru  1  Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08 mmol&#183;cm  &#8208;2  &#183;h  &#8208;1  ) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3%) at &#8208; 0.3 V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100 mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru  1  Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Efficient Solution to Monofluoroalkylation: Divergent Synthesis of Aliphatic Monofluorides with Modular Synthetic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method allow preparation of diverse monofluorides based on the monofluoroalkyl triflate scaffold. Both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of Grignard reagents were studied. Further utilities including conversion into conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkanes are important in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate a broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with monofluoroalkyl triflate as the synthetic scaffold. Using both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. The broad utility of this monofluoroalkylating reagent is shown by concise conversion into various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom&#8208;based coupling partners.

&lt;p&gt;Monofluoroalkanes are important in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate a broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with monofluoroalkyl triflate as the synthetic scaffold. Using both nickel-catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper-catalyzed C&#8722;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. The broad utility of this monofluoroalkylating reagent is shown by concise conversion into various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro-alkoxy, -alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom-based coupling partners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural and Dynamic Analysis of Sulphur Dioxide Adsorption in a Series of Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework materials have been investigated for reversible SO2 uptake. The incorporation of atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII, amine or heteroatomic sulphur sites enhances the uptake of SO2 at low concentrations. This work confirms that control of pore environments is an important approach for optimising the adsorption of SO2 at low concentrations.







Abstract
We report reversible high capacity adsorption of SO2 in robust Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials. Zr&#8208;bptc (H4bptc=biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid) shows a high SO2 uptake of 6.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, reflecting excellent capture capability and removal of SO2 at low concentration (2500&#8197;ppm). Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the introduction of amine, atomically&#8208;dispersed CuII or heteroatomic sulphur sites into the pores enhance the capture of SO2 at low concentrations. The captured SO2 can be converted quantitatively to a pharmaceutical intermediate, aryl N&#8208;aminosulfonamide, thus converting waste to chemical values. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared micro&#8208;spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering enable the visualisation of the binding domains of adsorbed SO2 molecules and host&#8211;guest binding dynamics in these materials at the atomic level. Refinement of the pore environment plays a critical role in designing efficient sorbent materials.

Tissue&#8208;transparent red light&#160;is used to release oleic acid, a signaling lipid, into cells, which induces Ca2+&#160;oscillations accompanied by a turn&#8208;on fluorescence response. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205855), Tom&#225;&#353; Slanina and co&#8208;workers show that &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY photocages substituted with sulfonate groups can selectively target inner or outer membranes and release carboxylic acid upon red&#8208;light illumination.

         <title>para&#8208;Selective Radical Trifluoromethylation of Benzamide Derivatives via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives was developed that makes use of iminium intermediates. The iminium species, formed in situ from Tf2O, pyridine and amides, feature greatly enhanced reactivity at the para&#8208;position towards radical&#8208;type nucleophilic C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arenes via a radical pathway has attracted considerable attention recently. However, a major challenge of C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation is the lack of site&#8208;selectivity on the phenyl ring especially para&#8208;selectivity. Herein we show a new strategy for para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of benzamide derivatives using iminium activation. The reaction undergoes a radical&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution instead of a radical&#8208;type electrophilic substitution owing to iminium activation as a result of lowering the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital). A wide range of substrates are compatible with this method giving almost exclusive para&#8208;trifluoromethylated products.

         <title>Phenacyl Bromide as a Single&#8208;Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization of N&#8208;Methylpyrrole and N&#8208;Methylindole</title>

Photoinduced step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole and N&#8208;methylindole was accomplished using phenacyl bromide as single&#8208;component photoinitiator under near&#8208;UV irradiation.







Abstract
The synthesis of step&#8208;growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step&#8208;growth polymerization of N&#8208;methylpyrrole (MPyr) and N&#8208;methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated. PAB single component photoinitiator enables an efficient, rapid, room temperature step&#8208;growth polymerization process of MPyr and MIn that can be applied to other conjugated monomers.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Anchored on Graphene for Enhanced Organic Pollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed homogeneously on the surface of a graphene template via a facile hydrothermal method, as reported by Freddy Kleitz and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206564). Benefitting from the maximum exposure of active sites and sufficient interaction with target water pollutants, ultrathin COF could effectively shorten equilibrium time and increase adsorption capacity for the removal of organic dyes with various sizes.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis between a Dipeptide Phosphonium Salt and a Metal&#8208;Based Lewis Acid for Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Bridged [3.2.1] Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergic catalytic method for asymmetric construction of N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] rings by a phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been developed. This route affords fluorine&#8208;installed tropane derivatives in excellent stereoselectivities. The mechanistic results revealed that the silver nitrite was installed on the phosphonium salt via hydrogen bonding and simultaneously activated the dipole, in a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model.







Abstract
We present an unprecedented synergic catalytic route for the asymmetric construction of fluorinated N&#8208;bridged [3.2.1] cyclic members of tropane family via a bifunctional phosphonium salt/silver co&#8208;catalyzed cyclization process. A broad variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups are compatible with this method, providing targeted compounds bearing seven&#8208;membered ring and four contiguous stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The gram&#8208;scale preparations, facile elaborations and preliminary biological activities of the products demonstrate the application potential. Moreover, both experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the cyclization proceeded via a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; reaction model with multiple weak&#8208;bond cooperative activations. Insights gained from our studies are expected to advance general efforts towards the catalytic synthesis of challenging chiral heterocyclic molecules.

         <title>A Stable and Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Isolated Active Sites for Highly Selective Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to acetate provides a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy, but acetate is usually a by&#8208;product. A covalent organic framework with isolated active sites for highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to acetate was revealed by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;wokers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206470). The copper&#8208;phthalocyanine active site with high electron density is conducive to the key step of C&#8722;C coupling of *CH3 with CO2 to produce acetate, and can avoid the coupling of *CO with *CO or *CHO to produce ethylene and ethanol.

         <title>Organometallic Synthesis of Magnetic Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic metal nanoparticles (MMNPs) have great potential in a multitude of applications such as catalysis, biomedicine and environmental remediation. This Minireview highlights advances over the last two decades in the organometallic synthesis of MMNPs. The resulting MMNPs have tailor&#8208;made sizes, shapes, compositions and magnetic properties, leading to their application in magnetically induced catalysis and biosensing.







Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive both for their fundamental properties and for their potential in a variety of applications ranging from nanomedicine and biology to micro/nanoelectronics and catalysis. While these fields are dominated by the use of iron oxides, reduced metal NPs are of interest since they display high magnetization and adjustable anisotropy according to their size, shape and composition. The use of organometallic precursors makes it possible to adjust the size, shape (sphere, cube, rod, wire, urchin, &#8230;) and composition (alloys, core&#8211;shell, composition gradient, dumbbell, &#8230;) of the resulting NPs and hence their magnetic properties. We discuss here the synthesis of magnetic metal NPs from organometallic precursors carried out in Toulouse, as well as their associated properties and their potential in applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Carbamoylation of Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes has been developed to enable the formation of vicinal stereogenic centers. This protocol allows for facile synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal or quaternary stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. DFT calculations suggest that the enantiodetermining step is intramolecular migratory insertion with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate.







Abstract
Herein, we leverage the Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes with alkyl iodides to enable the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers. The application of newly developed 1&#8208;NapQuinim is critical for formation of two contiguous stereocenters in high yield, enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. This catalytic system also improves both the yield and enantioselectivity in the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Computational studies reveal that the enantiodetermining step proceeds with a carbamoyl&#8208;NiI intermediate that is reduced by the Mn reductant prior to intramolecular migratory insertion. The presence of the t&#8208;butyl group of the Quinim ligand leads to an unfavorable distortion of the substrate in the TS that leads to the minor enantiomer. Calculations also support an improvement in enantioselectivity with 1&#8208;NapQuinim compared to p&#8208;tolQuinim.

         <title>Unusual Size Effect in Ion and Charge Transport in Micron&#8208;Sized Particulate Aluminum Anodes of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual size effect in ion and charge transport in micron&#8208;sized particulate aluminum anodes is recognized for the first time and the underlying reason has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations.







Abstract
Aluminum is a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity, excellent conductivity, and natural abundance. An anomalous size effect was observed for micron&#8208;sized aluminum powder electrodes in this work. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the insulating oxide surface layer is the underlying cause, which leads to poor electrical conductivity and limited capacity utilization when the particle is too small. Additionally, poor electrolyte wettability also accounts for the hindered reaction kinetics due to the weak polarity feature of the oxide layer. Surface grafting of polar amino groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve electrolyte wettability. The present work revealed the critical limitations and underlying mechanisms for the aluminum anode, which is crucial for its practical application. Our results are also valuable for other metallic anodes with similar issues.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at the Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8722;C Coupling via a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective functionalization of carboranes with multiple B&#8722;H sites is a long&#8208;standing challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205672), Hong Yan and co&#8208;workers developed an efficient reaction protocol to achieve selective alkylation, alkenylation and heteroarylation of carboranes under mild conditions via boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals generated by photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of boron&#8208;substituted carborane carboxylic acids.

     alt="Site-Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at the Electron-Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8722;C Coupling via a Carboranyl Cage Radical"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-selective functionalization of carboranes with multiple B&#8722;H sites is a long-standing challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202205672"&gt;10.1002/anie.202205672&lt;/a&gt;), Hong Yan and co-workers developed an efficient reaction protocol to achieve selective alkylation, alkenylation and heteroarylation of carboranes under mild conditions via boron vertex-centered carboranyl radicals generated by photo-induced decarboxylation of boron-substituted carborane carboxylic acids.

         <title>Deciphering the Metal Speciation in Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Complexes by IMS&#8208;MS: Application to the Detection of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimics in Cell Lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the crowded cell environment, Mn&#8208;based SOD mimics were detected and quantified, with an analogous [13C6LCoII] (L=ligand) as a standard, in intricate cell lysates by using ion mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS). In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203066), Clotilde Policar et&#8197;al. show that IMS is powerful enough to separate complexes of the same ligand bound to different divalent metal cations with similar ionic radii. In timsTOF, ions are pushed by the gas flow, retained electrostatically, and as represented in the picture, the smaller, the slower.

         <title>Azo Compounds as Active Materials of Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azo&#8208;containing compounds are promising active materials for rechargeable batteries and anolytes for redox flow batteries. The interaction between the N=N group and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the introduction of insoluble carboxylate groups, and polymerization lead to excellent battery performances. Azo molecules also showed excellent performance as both aqueous and organic anolyte of redox flow batteries.







Abstract
The rapid evolution of electrical devices and the increasing demand for the supply of sustainable energy necessitate the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems such as rechargeable and redox flow batteries. However, these batteries typically contain inorganic active materials, which exhibit several critical drawbacks hindering further development. In this regard, azo compounds are promising alternatives, offering the benefits of fast kinetics, multi&#8208;electron redox reactions, and tunable (via structural adjustment) battery performance. Herein, we review the use of azo compounds as the active materials of rechargeable and redox flow batteries, discuss certain aspects of material design and electrochemical reaction mechanisms, and summarize the corresponding perspectives and research directions to facilitate further progress in this field.

         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of a cyapho(dicyano)methanide salt, [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)  2  (CP)], from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH  2  ] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 = 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclo&#8208;octadecane) with 1,1&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;dicyanoethylene (EtO)  2  C=C(CN)  2. The reaction proceeds through a Michael addition&#8208;elimination pathway to afford [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][HP{C(OEt)=C(CN)  2  }]. Addition of strong, non&#8208;nucleophilic base (KHMDS) to this intermediate results in the formation of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][C(CN)  2  (CP)]. Subsequent reactivity studies reveal that that cyapho(dicyano)methanide ion is susceptible to protonation with strong acids to afford the parent acid HC(CN)  2  (CP). The reactivity of the cyaphide moiety in [C(CN)  2  (CP)]  &#8722;  was explored through coordination to metal centers and in cycloaddition reactions with azides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitatation of Pb4&#8208;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0 &#177; 0.2 nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100 nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72%. Stored at 4 &#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9% of the initial value after 15 days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5 months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8208;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10 mW/cm2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing electrocatalytic reaction with high&#8208;efficiency meets the need for the sustainable society, which can make important contribution to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products with long&#8208;term stability over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high faradaic efficiency (81.2%) and current density (22.6 mA cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36 h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8208;C coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Drug Repurposing by Siderophore Conjugation: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Siderophore&#8208;Methotrexate Conjugates as Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of methotrexate (Mtx) with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterial conjugates is reported. The most potent conjugate exhibited over 1000&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica compared with Mtx, while possessing 2313&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index.







Abstract
Drug repurposing is considered a promising strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Methotrexate (Mtx), a classical anticancer drug, could strongly inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). However, its poor permeability into bacteria and potent human cytotoxicity make it unsuitable as an antibacterial. Herein, we reported the conjugation of Mtx with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterials. The most potent conjugate 8 with nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values exhibited over 1.00&#215;103&#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Gram&#8208;negative Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica) compared with Mtx, while possessing 2.31&#215;103&#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;106&#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study verifies that siderophore conjugation is an effective strategy for developing new antibacterials from anticancer drugs.

&lt;p&gt;The conjugation of methotrexate (Mtx) with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterial conjugates is reported. The most potent conjugate exhibited over 1000-fold improved activity against Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Yersinia enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; compared with Mtx, while possessing 2313-fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-fold improvements in the therapeutic index.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug repurposing is considered a promising strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Methotrexate (Mtx), a classical anticancer drug, could strongly inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). However, its poor permeability into bacteria and potent human cytotoxicity make it unsuitable as an antibacterial. Herein, we reported the conjugation of Mtx with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterials. The most potent conjugate &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; with nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values exhibited over 1.00&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-fold improved activity against Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;) and Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Yersinia enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Y. enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;) compared with Mtx, while possessing 2.31&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-fold improvements in the therapeutic index. This proof-of-principle study verifies that siderophore conjugation is an effective strategy for developing new antibacterials from anticancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nearly Unity Quantum Yield Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Heavy Atom&#8208;Free Rigid Inorganic/Organic Hybrid Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heavy atom&#8208;free inorganic/organic hybrid composites are prepared by a simple and green solid&#8208;phase method. Through the synergism of covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds, the organic guest phosphors can be completely fixed in the inorganic matrix, just like in the low&#8208;temperature glass state, thus exhibiting highly efficient and persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% and average lifetimes up to 8.74&#8197;s.







Abstract
Synergism between covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds is employed to fix an organic phosphor guest in a rigid inorganic framework, simulating the stiffening effect seen in the glassy state and realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Twelve heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free composites have been obtained through introducing arylboric or arylcarboxylic acid derivatives into the inorganic boric acid matrix by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Owing to the stiffening effect of multiple bonds, all the composites show highly efficient and persistent RTP of guest molecules with a quantum yield ranging from 39.8&#8201;% to ca. 100&#8201;% and a lifetime up to 8.74&#8197;s, which results in a 55&#8197;s afterglow visible to the naked eye after exposure to a portable UV lamp. Interestingly, it is found that the substitution position and quantity of carboxyl in the guest have a great influence on the phosphorescent properties, and that the heavy&#8208;atom effect is invalid in such host&#8211;guest hybrid systems. The 100&#8197;g grade composite is easily prepared because of the solvent&#8208;free, green, and simple synthesis method. These results provide an important way for the development of RTP materials with ultrahigh quantum yield and ultralong lifetime, as well as their practical applications in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage, among others.

         <title>The Rational Design and Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral C2&#8208;Arylpyrrole&#8208;Derived Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold, NPNOL, has been rationally designed. For the enantioselective synthesis of NPNOL, the chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction was utilized. Density functional theory calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. NPNOL could serve as a new platform for the development of chiral ligands and catalysts.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl diols have achieved great success in asymmetric catalysis. By contrast, axially chiral biaryl amino alcohols are far less developed. Herein, we have rationally designed a versatile C1&#8208;symmetric biaryl amino alcohol scaffold 1&#8208;(1&#8208;amino&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (NPNOL) on the basis of axially chiral C2&#8208;arylpyrrole framework. For its enantioselective synthesis, the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Attanasi reaction between 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds and azoalkenes had been established. By using this practical method, a wide range of NPNOLs were readily prepared in high yields and excellent atroposelectivities (38 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity. The easy transformations of NPNOL&#8208;derived products into organocatalysts/ligands and their preliminary applications in asymmetric catalytic reactions demonstrated the promising utility of NPNOL.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactors for Continuous Decentralized H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reactors for continuous decentralized H2O2 production are described in this Minireview, with separate discussions of flow field plates, catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers, membranes, shapes, and electrolyte compartments. The key factors of these parts and the optimization strategies for assembling flow cells are summarized. Insights and perspectives on key components are given.







Abstract
The global utilization of H2O2 is currently around 4 million tons per year and is expected to continue to increase in the future. H2O2 is mainly produced by the anthraquinone process, which involves multiple steps in terms of alkylanthraquinone hydrogenation/oxidation in organic solvents and liquid&#8211;liquid extraction of H2O2. The energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally unfriendly anthraquinone process does not meet the requirements of sustainable and low&#8208;carbon development. The electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) driven by renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind power) offers a more economical, low&#8208;carbon, and greener route to produce H2O2. However, continuous and decentralized H2O2 electrosynthesis still poses many challenges. This Minireview first summarizes the development of devices for H2O2 electrosynthesis, and then introduces each component, the assembly process, and some optimization strategies.

         <title>Construction of Benzocyclobutenes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Triplet Biradical Atom Transfer of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives have been obtained by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced triplet biradical atom transfer of olefins. The reaction mechanism was investigated by deuterium&#8208;labeling and kinetic quenching experiments, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a method that provides an array of benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeds by engaging triplet biradical atom transfer of olefinic compounds in the activation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction mechanism involves the generation of triplet excited state of diarylethylene derivative and subsequent HAT process, and then the further ring&#8208;closing reaction affording the product via an electrocyclization process. The plausible mechanism is supported by control and deuterium labeling experiments, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Consequences of Noncovalent Interfacial Contacts between Nanoparticles and Giant Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle interaction induces morphological changes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) upon binding to surface&#8208;immobilized hCAII. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations, and ratios affect the strength of adhesion. Adhesion strength determines the interaction outcome, namely, weak/strong inter&#8208;GUV adhesion and GUV lysis.







Abstract
Biological membrane fluidity enables shape reform upon a functionally complementary encounter between a biomolecule and a synthetic nanoparticle. Nanomedicine uses ligand&#8208;cell surface receptor affinities for nanoparticle targeting. However, due to toxicity concerns, the nature of the nanoparticle&#8211;biomembrane interaction needs exploration to realize ligand surface density and receptor&#8211;ligand interaction effects on subsequent uptake/other interaction outcomes. In this study, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were surface&#8208;immobilized with a hCAII model receptor to study nanoparticle&#8211;complementary surface ligand interactions. We find interaction strength impacts morphological outcomes, namely, inter&#8208;GUV adhesion, lysis, and GUV swallowing. Nanoparticle size, receptor/ligand surface densities, overall receptor/ligand concentrations and ratios affect the strength of adhesion, and thus the outcome. Interaction energy effects on GUV morphological outcomes offer fundamental insights into the design of abiological materials for interacting with biological materials.

         <title>Trojan Nanobacteria System for Photothermal Programmable Destruction of Deep Tumor Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trojan nanobacteria for tumor targeting and inhibition have been constructed in which the photothermal nanoparticles are loaded inside the bacteria. The bacteria target the tumor region and penetrate deep tumor tissues. The photothermal effect inhibits the tumor growth and deactivates the bacteria. The use of bacteria allows for genetic modification which adds additional therapeutic modalities against tumor growth.







Abstract
A novel bacteria&#8208;based drug delivery system, termed &#8220;Trojan nanobacteria system&#8221;, has been developed in which nanoagents are internalized into engineered bacteria through bacteria&#8208;specific maltodextrin (MD) transporters. Compared to the method of attaching nanoagents to bacterial surfaces, this Trojan system features higher payloads and better stability. In cancer therapy, Trojan nanobacteria can specifically discriminate the tumor region and then penetrate deep tumor tissues. Once in the tumor, the Trojan nanobacteria systems are able to destroy deep tumor tissues due to the combined effects of antitumor protein expression (e.g., tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945;, TNF&#8208;&#945;) and photothermal properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state materials as functional electrolytes surpass liquid counterparts as next&#8208;generation energy sources. This Review summarizes recent advances in design strategies, synthesis approaches, conducting properties, and underlying mechanisms for ionic conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductors are compelling alternatives to liquid electrolytes in clean energy&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;storage technologies. The development of novel ionic conducting materials is one of the most critical challenges for next&#8208;generation energy technologies. Several advancements in design strategies, synthetic approaches, conducting properties, and underlying mechanisms for ionic conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been made over the past five years; however, despite the recent, considerable expansion of related research fields, there remains a lack of systematic overviews. Here, an extensive introduction to ionic conducting performance for MOFs with different design strategies is provided, focusing primarily on ion mobility with the aid of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or solvated ionic charge. Furthermore, current theories on ion conducting mechanisms in different regimes are comprehensively summarized to provide an understanding of the underlying working principles in complex, realistic systems. Finally, challenges and future research directions at the forefront of ionic conducting MOF technologies are outlined.

         <title>A Chimeric Conjugate of Antibody and Programmable DNA Nanoassembly Smartly Activates T Cells for Precise Cancer Cell Targeting</title>

         <dc:description>
A chimeric antibody&#8208;nucleic acid T&#8208;cell engager (CAN&#8208;TE) redirecting T cells to precisely target and potently kill the cancer cells by coupling 1)&#8197;a dynamic DNA circuit with high&#8208;order logic function for smart cell recognition or 2)&#8197;a multivalent aptameric DNA nanostructure to control the targeting avidity for tunable immune response.







Abstract
Synthetically directing T&#8208;cells against tumors emerges as a promising strategy in immunotherapy, while it remains challenging to smartly engage T cells with tunable immune response. Herein, we report an intelligent molecular platform to engineer T&#8208;cell recognition for selective activation to potently kill cancer cells. To this end, we fabricated a hybrid conjugate that uses a click&#8208;type DNA&#8211;protein conjugation to equip the T cell&#8208;engaging antibody with two distinct programmable DNA nanoassemblies. By integrating multiple aptameric antigen&#8208;recognitions within a dynamic DNA circuit, we achieved combinatorial recognition of triple&#8208;antigens on cancer cells for selective T&#8208;cell activation after high&#8208;order logic operation. Moreover, by coupling a DNA nanostructure, we precisely defined the valence of the antigen&#8208;binding aptamers to tune avidity, realizing effective tumor elimination in vitro and in vivo. Together, we present a versatile and programmable strategy for synthetic immunotherapy.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O Perovskite for Flexible Transparent X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskites are prepared that have multiple hydrogen bonds which improve the lattice stiffness for better endurance of X&#8208;ray radiation. Importantly, the flexible X&#8208;ray detector realizes the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with improved operational stability and has potential in pixelated matrix imaging.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites are of interest for their chemical diversity and eco&#8208;friendly properties, and recently have been used for X&#8208;ray detection with superior carrier behavior. However, the size and shape complexity of the organic components results in difficulties in evaluating their stability in high&#8208;energy radiation. Herein, we introduce multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond metal&#8208;free PAZE&#8208;NH4X3&#8901;H2O perovskite, where H2O leads to more hydrogen bonds appearing between organic molecules and the perovskite host. As suggested by the theoretical calculations, multiple hydrogen bonds promote stiffness of the lattice, and increase the diffusion barrier to inhibit ionic migration. Then, low trap density, high &#956;&#964; products and structural flexibility of PAZE&#8208;NH4Br3&#8901;H2O give a flexible X&#8208;ray detector with the highest sensitivity of 3708&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 0.19&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior spatial resolution of 5.0&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioremediation: The discovery of MG8, an efficient polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase enzyme from the human saliva metagenome, is reported by Worawan Bhanthumnavin, Chayasith Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203061). Aside from its plastic degradation capability, MG8 was further engineered via genetic code expansion into a covalent binder of PET plastic and can be used to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters.

Compounds  3  and  4  can be converted into each other by reactions with  1  and P  4  , respectively. All new compounds  1  &#8208;  4  were unequivocally characterized including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries enabled by Amidoxime&#8208;Functionalized Ion&#8208;Selective Polymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) based on aqueous organic electrolytes are a promising technology for safe and cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. Membrane separators are a key component in RFBs, allowing fast conduction of charge&#8208;carrier ions but minimizing the cross&#8208;over of redox&#8208;active species. Here, we report the molecular engineering of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs) by tuning their polymer chain topology and pore architecture to optimize membrane ion transport selectivity. AO&#8208;PIM membranes are integrated with three emerging aqueous organic flow battery chemistries, and the synergetic integration of ion&#8208;selective membranes with molecular engineered organic molecules in neutral&#8208;pH electrolytes leads to significantly enhanced cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of a compromise of abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with low environmental footprint and performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis in particular titanium dioxide and in recent years, more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide&#8208;nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate the role of free against that of bound charges inside the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of an overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. waster water treatment or ultimately water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cathode Interface Layer Based on 4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;Pyrene Diimide for Highly Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient cathode interfacial layers (CILs) are becoming essential elements for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the absorption of commonly used cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) is either too weak or overlaps too much with that of photoactive materials, hindering their contribution to the light absorption. In this work, we demonstrate the construction of highly efficient CIMs based on 2, 7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;pyrene diimide (t&#8208;PyDI) framework. By introducing amino, amino N&#8208;oxide and quaternary ammonium bromide as functional groups, three novel self&#8208;doped CIMs named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are synthesized. These CIMs are capable of boosting the device performances by broadening the absorption, forming ohmic contact at the interface of active layer and electrode, as well as facilitating electron collection. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.25%, which is among the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Fused Tetracyclic Heterocycles from Diarylalkynes Enabled by the Selective Insertion of Isocyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a direct and efficient synthesis of diverse polysubstituted fused tetracyclic heterocycles with good functional group tolerance from diarylalkynes under different palladium catalytic systems. In this chemistry, an unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes through the highly selective sequential double insertion of isocyanide was achieved for the first time. The practicality of this method was further demonstrated by the construction of various bioactive molecules and important structural motifs, with potential applications in materials science and biochemistry. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) elucidated an interesting &#8220;Pd walk&#8221; might occur during the cyclization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Quinolines by Direct Conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct production of heterocyclic aromatic compounds from lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 models remains a huge challenge due to the incompatible catalysis for aryl ether bonds cleavage and heterocyclic ring formation. Herein, the first example of   quinoline  synthesis from &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields up to 89%. The reaction pathway involves selective cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, C&#8208;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. The control experiments suggest that both imine and chalcone were identified as the key intermediates, and the rate determining step as well as the preferred pathway were experimentally clarified and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  Based on this protocol, the conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymer delivered 56 wt% yield of quinoline derivative in three steps. This transformation provides a potential petroleum&#8208;independent choice for heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Explore Structure&#8208;Property Relationships of Protein Immobilization in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins immobilized in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) often show extraordinary stability. However, most efforts to immobilize proteins in MOFs have only been exploratory. Herein, we present the first systematic study on the thermodynamics of protein immobilization in MOFs. Using insulin as a probe, we leveraged isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how topology, pore size, and hydrophobicity of MOFs influence immobilization. ITC data obtained from the encapsulation of insulin in a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs reveals that MOFs provide proteins with a hydrophobic stabilizing microenvironment, making the encapsulation entropically driven. In particular, the pyrene&#8208;based NU&#8208;1000 tightly encapsulates insulin in its ideally sized mesopores and stabilizes insulin through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, resulting in the most enthalpically favored encapsulation process among this series. This study reveals critical insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of protein immobilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Poly(phthalocyanine) Scaffolds Derived from a Mechanochemical Approach Towards Enhanced Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines (Pc)&#8208;derived materials represent an attractive category of porous organic scaffolds featured by extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks, but their construction is still limited to the solution&#8208;based pathways, producing materials with inferior conductivity and porosity. Herein, a mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of aromatic nitrile monomers with ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts (magnesium, zinc, or aluminium) under neat and ambient conditions. Diverse Pc&#8208;functionalized conjugated porous networks (Pc&#8208;CPNs) were obtained featured by extensively and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons, high surface areas, and hierarchical porosities. The monomers in this mechanochemical approach could be extended to those difficult to be handled in solution&#8208;based procedures. The Pc&#8208;CPNs displayed attractive electrochemical performance as supercapacitor and anodes in batteries, together with superb long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal Complexes for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction: From Adjustment of Intrinsic Activity to Molecular Immobilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction reaction (ECO  2  RR) is one promising method for storing intermittent clean energy in the chemical bonds and producing fuels. Among various kinds of catalysts for ECO  2  RR, molecular metal complexes with well&#8208;defined structures, thus offer convenient approaches to perform rational designing, investigation about the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship and mechanistic studies. In this review, we summarize the molecular engineering of several N&#8208;based metal complexes including Re/Mn bipyridine compounds and metal macrocycles, concluding the general modification strategies to devise novel molecular catalysts with high intrinsic activity. Through physical adsorption, covalent linking and forming periodic backbone, these active molecules could be heterogenized into immobilized catalysts with more practical prospect. In the end, significant challenges and opportunities based on molecular catalysts are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange as a Route for Endosomal Escape of Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endosomal entrapment has remained the major bottleneck for cytosolic delivery of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems. Uncovering fundamentally new pathways for endosomal escape is therefore highly sought. Herein, we report that disulfide bonds can enhance endosomal escape through contacts with cellular exofacial thiols, in addition to facilitating cellular uptake. Our results are supported through comparative analysis of polymeric nanogels with variable accessibility to disulfide bonds by placing these functionalities at the core or the shell of the nanogels. The findings here inform future chemical design of delivery vehicles.</dc:description>

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeting DNA Nanodevice for Autophagy&#8208;dependent Degradation of Proteins in Membrane&#8208;bound Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways has become a promising therapeutic approach, and proteins in cytoplasm or on the cell membrane can be easily contacted and have become the major targets. However, degradation of disease&#8208;related proteins that exist in membrane&#8208;bound organelles (MBO) such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains unsolved due to the membrane limits. Here we describe a DNA nanodevice that shows ER targeting capacity and undergoes new intracellular degradation via the autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. Then the DNA nanostructure functionalized with specific ligands are used to selectively catch ER&#8208;localized proteins and then transport them to the lysosome for degradation. Through this technique, the degradation of both exogenous ER&#8208;resident protein (ER&#8208;eGFP) and endogenous overexpressed molecular chaperone (glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78) in cancer cells has been successfully executed with high efficiency. This strategy expands the range of currently proposed protein degradation platforms and may contribute to the development of targeted cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile  Benzylic Alkylation of Arenes with Alcohols by Catalysis with Spirocyclic NHC Ir(III) Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile benzylic alkylation of indenes and other arenes was developed from readily available primary and secondary alcohols using our newly investigated CCC pincer Ir(III) catalyst (SNIr&#8208;H). An excellent regioselectivity and yield (89%) of the C3&#8208;alkylated indenes were obtained. Additionally, the challenging sp  2  C&#8208;alkylation was readily accomplished. This method could be utilized for the synthesis of the analogs of a histamine H1 receptor antagonist and the functional material template molecule, indeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene. A hemilabile Ir(III)&#8208;dihydride intermediate was proposed based on control experiments and previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the borrowing hydrogen mechanism, and is key to the success of this Ir(III) catalyst in the reduction of unactivated multi&#8208;substituted olefin intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 upon Specific RNA&#8208;Binding Observed by Magnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with specific single&#8208;stranded RNA and its relation to liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) were studied  in vitro  by magnetic resonance based on site&#8208;directed spin labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low&#8208;complexity domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid&#8208;droplet formation. Such LLPS depended on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that an interplay of sequence&#8208;specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation of specific RNA segregation during stress response.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ophiorrhine A, G and Ophiorrhiside E Featuring a Bioinspired Intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids ophiorrhine A via a late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition to form the intricate bridged and spirannic polycyclic system. Several strategies were investigated to construct the indolopyridone moiety of ophiorrhiside E, the postulated biosynthetic precursor of ophiorrhine A. Eventually, the Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type coupling of indolyl&#8208;acetamide with secologanin&#8208;derived acid chloride delivered ophiorrhine G. Cyclodehydration of a protected form of the latter was followed by the desired spontaneous intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of protected ophiorrhiside E leading to ophiorrhine A.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Investigations of Differentially Oxidized Polycyclic Pyrroles from Bipolaris&#160;Fungi: Synthetic Entry Into the Bipolamine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron&#8208;rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Co&#8208;assembly Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Perovskite Oxides with Abundant Surface Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with well&#8208;defined mesostrcture and versatile metal sites are attractive, but their successful synthesis faces challenges of complicated assembly dynamics and pore collapse in crystalline calcination. Here, we propose an energy balance concept to reveal interplay relationship in assembly process and realize regulation of porous structure for mesoporous perovskite oxides. Series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with unique porous structure were prepared by a modular co&#8208;assembly method. And mesoporous La2Zr2O7 shows 94% conversion and 99% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Experiments reveal that rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure promote interaction between mesoporous La2Zr2O7 and HMF and reduce catalytic energy barrier. This work provides the insight into molecule co&#8208;assembly and developing multiple component ordered mesoporous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Pharmacological Chaperones for GCase That Switch Conformation with pH Enhance Enzyme Levels in Gaucher Animal Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations which destabilize the native folded form of GCase, triggering degradation and ultimately resulting in low enzyme activity. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) which stabilize mutant GCase have been used to increase lysosomal activity through improving trafficking efficiency. By engineering their inherent basicity, we have synthesized PCs that change conformation between the ER and the lysosomal environment, thus weakening binding to GCase after its successful trafficking to the lysosome. NMR studies confirmed the conformational change while X&#8208;ray data reveal bound conformations and binding modes. These results were further corroborated by cell studies showing increases in GCase activity when using the pH&#8208;switchable probe at low dosing. Preliminary  in vivo  assays with humanized mouse models of Gaucher showed enhanced GCase activity levels in relevant tissues, including the brain, further supporting their potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentene Derivatives via Electrochemically Induced Intermolecular Selective (3+2) Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical mediator&#8208;induced intermolecular selective (3+2) annulation of readily available alkenes and alkynes/alkenes was developed. The simple and efficient method allows the synthesis of a library of decorated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was performed, which indicated that an iodine radical and carbon radicals are involved in this transformation.







Abstract
Cyclopentenes are common cores in many natural products, and in bioactive and functional molecules. However, their synthesis remains challenging in terms of harsh conditions, poor selectivity, prefunctionalization of the substrates, over&#8208;reliance on volatile activating reagents and the use of noble metals. Herein, we develop an electrochemical mediator&#8208;induced intermolecular selective (3+2) annulation of readily available alkenes and alkynes/alkenes, which provides a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of a library of decorated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This protocol features high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high regioselectivity. Potential applications are demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as the construction of structural diversity and complexity. A preliminary mechanistic investigation was performed, which indicated that an iodine radical and carbon radicals are involved in this transformation.

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Mn&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by Inorganic&#8211;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward the energy upgrade of aqueous batteries, an aqueous Mn&#8208;metal battery is reported for which the electrolyte and inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces were designed. The inorganic interface provides a bubble&#8208;free environment for the organic interface formed by esterification. The Mn||Mn cell shows a life of 200&#8197;h, and the Mn||V2O5 battery realizes a higher output voltage than the Zn||V2O5 counterpart. This work paves the way for Mn&#8208;anode and energetic aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous batteries that use metal anodes exhibit maximum anodic capacity, whereas the energy density is still unsatisfactory partially due to the high redox potential of the metal anode. Current metal anodes are plagued by the dilemma that the redox potential of Zn is not low enough, whereas Al, Mg, and others with excessively low redox potential cannot work properly in aqueous electrolytes. Mn metal with a suitably low redox potential is a promising candidate, which was rarely explored before. Here, we report a rechargeable aqueous Mn&#8208;metal battery enabled by a well&#8208;designed electrolyte and robust inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces. The inorganic Sn&#8208;based interface with a bottom&#8208;up microstructure was constructed to preliminarily suppress water decomposition. With this bubble&#8208;free interface, the organic interface can be formed via an esterification reaction of sucrose triggered by acyl chloride in the electrolyte, generating a dense physical shield that isolates water while permitting Mn2+ diffusion. Hence, a Mn symmetric cell achieves a superior plating/stripping stability for 200&#8197;hours, and a Mn||V2O5 battery maintains approximately 100&#8201;% capacity after 200&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the Mn||V2O5 battery realizes a much higher output voltage than that of the Zn||V2O5 battery, evidencing the possibility of increasing the energy density through using a Mn anode.

     alt="Rechargeable Aqueous Mn-Metal Battery Enabled by Inorganic&#8211;Organic Interfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the energy upgrade of aqueous batteries, an aqueous Mn-metal battery is reported for which the electrolyte and inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces were designed. The inorganic interface provides a bubble-free environment for the organic interface formed by esterification. The Mn||Mn cell shows a life of 200&#8197;h, and the Mn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery realizes a higher output voltage than the Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart. This work paves the way for Mn-anode and energetic aqueous batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous batteries that use metal anodes exhibit maximum anodic capacity, whereas the energy density is still unsatisfactory partially due to the high redox potential of the metal anode. Current metal anodes are plagued by the dilemma that the redox potential of Zn is not low enough, whereas Al, Mg, and others with excessively low redox potential cannot work properly in aqueous electrolytes. Mn metal with a suitably low redox potential is a promising candidate, which was rarely explored before. Here, we report a rechargeable aqueous Mn-metal battery enabled by a well-designed electrolyte and robust inorganic&#8211;organic interfaces. The inorganic Sn-based interface with a bottom-up microstructure was constructed to preliminarily suppress water decomposition. With this bubble-free interface, the organic interface can be formed via an esterification reaction of sucrose triggered by acyl chloride in the electrolyte, generating a dense physical shield that isolates water while permitting Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Hence, a Mn symmetric cell achieves a superior plating/stripping stability for 200&#8197;hours, and a Mn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery maintains approximately 100&#8201;% capacity after 200&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the Mn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery realizes a much higher output voltage than that of the Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; battery, evidencing the possibility of increasing the energy density through using a Mn anode. This work develops a systematic strategy to stabilize a Mn-metal anode for Mn-metal batteries, opening a new door towards enhanced voltage of aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Electrostatically Templated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable templated polymerization system is reported where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated. Regulating the templating effect enables control over the polymerization kinetics and provides an effective &#8220;ON&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;OFF&#8221; switch for polymer growth. The controlled co&#8208;assembly of template and growing polymers with modular association strength provides a novel concept to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways.







Abstract
We report a switchable, templated polymerization system where the strength of the templating effect can be modulated by solution pH and/or ionic strength. The responsiveness to these cues is incorporated through a dendritic polyamidoamine&#8208;based template of which the charge density depends on pH. The dendrimers act as a template for the polymerization of an oppositely charged monomer, namely sodium styrene sulfonate. We show that the rate of polymerization and maximum achievable monomer conversion are directly related to the charge density of the template, and hence the environmental pH. The polymerization could effectively be switched &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; on demand, by cycling between acidic and alkaline reaction environments. These findings break ground for a novel concept, namely harnessing co&#8208;assembly of a template and growing polymer chains with tunable association strength to create and control coupled polymerization and self&#8208;assembly pathways of (charged) macromolecular building blocks.

         <title>A CO2&#8208;Masked Carbene Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) decorated covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2) heterogeneous catalyst is prepared. COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 catalyzes the hydrosilylation of CO2 and the N&#8208;formylation of amines with CO2 to produce methanol and formamides. The activities rank COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 among the most active heterogeneous catalysts for these CO2 fixation reactions.







Abstract
Free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are generally prepared by treatment of imidazolium precursors with strong alkali reagents, which usually produces inactive NHC dimers. This treatment would destroy porous supports and thus make supported NHC catalysts difficult to recovery and reuse. Herein, we report the first stable CO2&#8208;masked N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) grafted on a porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF). The stable NHC&#8208;CO2 moieties in the COF&#8208;NHC&#8208;CO2 could be transformed in situ into isolated NHCs by heating, which exhibit superior catalytic performances in hydrosilylation and N&#8208;formylation reactions with CO2. The NHC sites can reversibly form NHC&#8208;CO2 and thus can be easily recycled and reused while maintaining excellent catalytic activity. Density functional theory calculations revealed that NHC sites can be fully exposed after removal of CO2&#8208;masks and rapidly react with silanes, which endows COF&#8208;NHC with high catalytic activity.

         <title>Efficient Protein&#8211;Protein Couplings Mediated by Small Molecules under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different reactivities of the fluorine, aldehyde, and phenylsulfonyl groups in 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)pincolinaldehyde (FPPA) toward free thiols make it possible to couple multiple proteins in distinct manners. A number of protein couplings mediated by FPPA have been demonstrated under mild conditions.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;protein coupling reactions under physiological conditions that do not impact the three&#8208;dimensional structures of the proteins are in high demand. Owing to the combination of phenylsulfonyl and aldehyde groups in 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)picolinaldehyde (FPPA), the fluorine substituent shows high reactivity toward free thiols. In FPPA, the fluorine is more reactive than phenylsulfonyl for free thiols. Thus the first quantitative nucleophilic substitution can be followed by selective substitution of phenylsulfonyl by an additional thiol or cyclization of aldehyde with a 1,2&#8208;aminothiol molecule. The FPPA mediated protein&#8211;protein coupling proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, resulting in stable protein conjugates. This coupling method has negligible 3D structural perturbations on the target proteins, and it produces overall intact, nearly traceless, and native structural folds of proteins. It is highly suitable for reconstruction of proteins that are difficult to make and segmental isotopic labeling of multidomain proteins.

         <title>Stereogradient Poly(Lactic Acid) from meso&#8208;Lactide/L&#8208;Lactide Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide mixtures was carried out at 180&#8201;&#176;C by employing a highly syndioselective catalyst based on a zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand. Stereogradient copolymers that exhibit enhanced crystallinities relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers were obtained with the industrial catalyst.







Abstract
The production of L&#8208;lactide from L&#8208;lactic acid involves a substantial formation of meso&#8208;lactide as an impurity, and, upon polymerization with the industrial catalyst tin octanoate, results in poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) of reduced crystallinity due to stereoerrors randomly distributed along the polymer chains. We describe a new approach wherein, instead of avoiding stereoerrors by removing the meso&#8208;lactide prior to polymerization, the stereoerrors in the polymer are tolerated, by crowding them in a stereogradient copolymer. A zirconium complex of an amine tris(phenolate) ligand is found to exhibit very high syndioselectivity in the ring opening polymerization catalysis of meso&#8208;lactide at room temperature, and gives rise to stereogradient copolymers in the polymerization of mixtures of meso&#8208;lactide/L&#8208;lactide in the melt at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Relative to the stereo&#8208;random copolymers obtained with tin octanoate, the stereogradient copolymers exhibit enhanced crystallinities manifested in lower solubilities and higher melting temperatures and enthalpies.

         <title>Transparent and Colorless Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Sensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent photovoltaics is a disruptive technology which widens the deployment of photovoltaics into new sectors such as for windows beyond the classical use of opaque panels. The great potential of pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dyes as NIR&#8208;sensitizers for the development of fully transparent and colorless dye sensitized solar cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of transparent solar cells extends the applications of photovoltaics by offering the opportunity to substitute the gigantic surface coverage of windows by solar panels to produce electricity. Herein, we report a new family of NIR&#8208;sensitizers based on pyrrolopyrrole cyanine dyes, particularly efficient for the development of fully transparent and colorless dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells since a record efficiency of 2.5&#8201;% was achieved with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 76&#8201;% and a color rending index (CRI) of 93.

         <title>Tuning the Interlayer Interactions of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables an Ultrastable Platform for Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable and anhydrous covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based proton conductor is prepared by tuning the interlayer interaction via importing planar and rigid triazine units into the center of C3&#8208;symmetric monomers. This work provides a solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs and contributes to the design and development of COF&#8208;based energy&#8208;related devices with proton&#8208;transport systems.







Abstract
The development of effective, stable anhydrous proton&#8208;conductive materials is vital but challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for ion and molecule conduction owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures and tailor&#8208;made functionalities. However, their poor chemical stability is due to weak interlayer interactions and intrinsic reversibility of linkages. Herein, we present a strategy for enhancing the interlayer interactions of two&#8208;dimensional COFs via importing planar, rigid triazine units into the center of C3&#8208;symmetric monomers. The developed triazine&#8208;core&#8208;based COF (denoted as TPT&#8208;COF) possesses a well&#8208;defined crystalline structure, ordered nanochannels, and prominent porosity. The proton conductivity was &#8776;10 times those of non&#8208;triazinyl COFs, even reaching up to 1.27&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 160&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the TPT&#8208;COF exhibited structural ultrastability, making it an effective proton transport platform with remarkable conductivity and long&#8208;term durability.

         <title>Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Enabled by Strong Multiple Ion&#8211;Dipole Interactions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal stable electrolyte based on a stable solvation structure using multiple ion&#8211;dipole interactions was designed and developed. The strong coordination in the solvated structure of the electrolyte defines the lithium deposition behavior and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li&#8208;metal Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) capable of operating stably at high temperature application scenarios are highly desirable. Conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries could only work stably under 60&#8201;&#176;C because of the thermal instability of electrolyte at elevated temperature. Here we design and develop a thermal stable electrolyte based on stable solvation structure using multiple ion&#8211;dipole interactions. The strong coordination in solvated structure of electrolyte defines the Li deposition behaviour and the evolution of solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth. For high mass loading LiFePO4&#8208;Li cells, the cells at 60&#8201;&#176;C with conventional electrolyte easily run into failures, but the cells with our electrolyte at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;&#176;C could cycle more than 120 and 50&#8197;cycles respectively. This work provides new insight into electrolyte design and contributes to the development of high temperature LMBs.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Direct Ultralong All&#8208;Phosphorescence from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photonic Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of transparent MOF glasses are made by a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. They exhibit a rare direct ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) output with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;%. Exploiting the highly efficient ultralong RTP of these MOF glasses, further photonic applications, such as all&#8208;photonic information storage and light&#8208;emitting devices, were developed.







Abstract
Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly desirable but remains a challenge due to the inherent competition between excited state lifetime and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly of transparent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) bulk glasses exhibiting direct ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescence (lifetime: 630.15&#8197;ms) with a PLQY of up to 75&#8201;% at ambient conditions. These macroscopic MOF glasses have high Young's modulus and hardness, which provide a rigid environment to reduce non&#8208;radiative transitions and boost triplet excitons. Spectral technologies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the photoluminescence of MOF glasses is directly derived from the different triplet excited states, indicating the great capability for color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission. We further developed information storage and light&#8208;emitting devices based on the efficient and pure RTP of the fabricated MOF photonic glasses.

         <title>Thermoelectric Zintl Compound In1&#8722;xGaxTe: Pure Acoustic Phonon Scattering and Dopant&#8208;Induced Deformation Potential Reduction and Lattice Shrink</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure acoustic phonon scattering is obtained in a coarse grain&#8208;In0.99Ga0.01Te&#8208;sample. The vibration anharmonicity is significantly enhanced by the Ga dopant, thus also enhancing the bonding hierarchy leading to a reduced deformation potential coefficient and denser intragranular dislocations. These effects collectively lead to a ZT of 1.2 at 648&#8197;K, the highest among its analogues.







Abstract
We report a Zintl phase thermoelectric material, coarse grain&#8208;In0.99Ga0.01Te, achieving a ZT peak of 1.2 at 648&#8197;K and an average ZT=0.8 in 300&#8211;650&#8197;K, which outperforms all the known InTe&#8208;based materials to date. The synergistic optimization of electronic property and phonon transport are achieved by the purification of grain boundary scattering, together with the Ga&#8208;doping&#8208;induced weak phonon&#8208;electron coupling, which enhances the carrier mobility and carrier concentration simultaneously and consequently gives a remarkably increased power factor of 8.9&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. The DFT phonon calculations indicate the dopant reduces the deformation potential coefficient and induces the lattice shrink, which reduces significantly the acoustic cutoff frequency, and enhances the scattering phase space. Moreover, the bonding hierarchy leads to the dense intragranular dislocation arrays, which suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity further and induces an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (0.21&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1).

         <title>Miniaturized Chemical Tags for Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers some of the recent advances in the development of small chemical tags for optical bioimaging, from their chemical synthesis and characterization to their application in different biological systems, such as cells, tissues and whole organisms. The Minireview focuses on the design of fluorescent and Raman labels and features examples of metabolites, amino acids, nucleic acids as well as organelle and cell&#8208;targeting probes.







Abstract
Recent advances in optical bioimaging have prompted the need for minimal chemical reporters that can retain the molecular recognition properties and activity profiles of biomolecules. As a result, several methodologies to reduce the size of fluorescent and Raman labels to a few atoms (e.g., single aryl fluorophores, Raman&#8208;active triple bonds and isotopes) and embed them into building blocks (e.g., amino acids, nucleobases, sugars) to construct native&#8208;like supramolecular structures have been described. The integration of small optical reporters into biomolecules has also led to smart molecular entities that were previously inaccessible in an expedite manner. In this article, we review recent chemical approaches to synthesize miniaturized optical tags as well as some of their multiple applications in biological imaging.

         <title>Double&#8208;Cavity Nor&#8208;Seco&#8208;Cucurbit[10]uril Enables Efficient and Rapid Separation of Pyridine from Mixtures of Toluene, Benzene, and Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic nor&#8208;seco&#8208;cucurbit[10]uril functions as an efficient adsorption separation material for the removal of pyridine from toluene and benzene, achieving &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity of the separated compounds. Thermal release of pyridine allows the ns&#8208;Q[10] separation material to be cycled at least 10&#8197;times without erosion of performance.







Abstract
Benzene, toluene and pyridine are widely used as essential raw materials in industry and laboratory research, with stringent purity requirements. Herein, we show that solid double&#8208;cavity host nor&#8208;seco&#8208;cucurbit[10]uril (ns&#8208;Q[10]) functions as an efficient adsorption separator for pyridine; benzene and toluene can be obtained in &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity by this method. Thermal removal of pyridine from ns&#8208;Q[10]&#8901;Py2 allows 10 separation cycles without erosion of performance. The geometry of the ns&#8208;Q[10]&#8901;Py2 ternary complex was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The ns&#8208;Q[10] cage facilitates the removal of pyridine from toluene and benzene, with &gt;99.9&#8201;% purity for the separated compounds.

         <title>A Molecular &#8220;A&#8208;Type&#8221; Tangled Metallocube</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; tangled metallocube has been generated by the reaction of a binuclear gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex and H2S. The tangled cube topology with 8 [(&#956;3&#8208;S)Au3]+ units and 12 bis&#8208;NHC ligands was validated by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Tangled cubes feature the topology of typical Platonic cubes, with their &#8220;faces&#8221; traversed by edges in different ways. This study generates an &#8220;A&#8208;type&#8221; tangled metallocube from the reaction of binuclear gold&#8208;NHC complex and H2S. The tangled cube topology was validated by multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution electrospray&#8208;ionization (HR&#8208;ESI) mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This study offers a simple and effective approach to designing and fabricating new, topologically unique molecular structures.

         <title>Surface Functionalization of Surfactant&#8208;Free Particles: A Strategy to Tailor the Properties of Nanocomposites for Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of functionalizing the surface of &#8220;naked&#8221; particles by using inorganic molecules is proposed. In particular, bismuth thiolates were used to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particles&#8217; surfaces. Upon thermal processing, bismuth thiolates decomposition renders SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites with synergistic functions to enhance thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
The broad implementation of thermoelectricity requires high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost materials. One possibility is employing surfactant&#8208;free solution synthesis to produce nanopowders. We propose the strategy of functionalizing &#8220;naked&#8221; particles&#8217; surface by inorganic molecules to control the nanostructure and, consequently, thermoelectric performance. In particular, we use bismuth thiolates to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particles&#8217; surfaces. Upon thermal processing, bismuth thiolates decomposition renders SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites with synergistic functions: 1) carrier concentration optimization by Bi doping; 2) Seebeck coefficient enhancement and bipolar effect suppression by energy filtering; and 3) lattice thermal conductivity reduction by small grain domains, grain boundaries and nanostructuration. Overall, the SnTe&#8208;Bi2S3 nanocomposites exhibit peak z&#8201;T up to 1.3 at 873&#8197;K and an average z&#8201;T of &#8776;0.6 at 300&#8211;873&#8197;K, which is among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed SnTe.

         <title>A General Route to Flame Aerosol Synthesis and In Situ Functionalization of Mesoporous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flame aerosol route to synthesize hollow structured mesoporous silica nanoparticles is presented, and a general in situ functionalization mechanism for loading highly dispersed catalytically active sites is proposed. Multiple applications are addressed in this class of material, including heterogeneous catalysis, dye adsorption, drug delivery, and thermal insulation.







Abstract
Mesoporous silica is a versatile material for energy, environmental, and medical applications. Here, for the first time, we report a flame aerosol synthesis method for a class of mesoporous silica with hollow structure and specific surface area exceeding 1000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. We show its superior performance in water purification, as a drug carrier, and in thermal insulation. Moreover, we propose a general route to produce mesoporous nanoshell&#8208;supported nanocatalysts by in situ decoration with active nanoclusters, including noble metal (Pt/SiO2), transition metal (Ni/SiO2), metal oxide (CrO3/SiO2), and alumina support (Co/Al2O3). As a prototypical application, we perform dry reforming of methane using Ni/SiO2, achieving constant 97&#8201;% CH4 and CO2 conversions for more than 200&#8197;hours, dramatically outperforming an MCM&#8208;41 supported Ni catalyst. This work provides a scalable strategy to produce mesoporous nanoshells and proposes an in situ functionalization mechanism to design and produce flexible catalysts for many reactions.

This work provides a scalable strategy to produce mesoporous nanoshells and proposes an in situ functionalization mechanism to design and produce flexible catalysts for many reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation and Moderate Congruent Melting Temperature of Layered Lead Iodide Perovskites for Thin&#8208;Film Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayered halide perovskites are prepared from a solvent&#8208;free liquid&#8208;solid reaction involving a layered perovskite in the molten state and (CH3NH3)PbI3 (MAPI) in the solid state. These layered halide perovskites based on HO2C(CH2)3NH3+ cations exhibit congruent melting at moderate temperatures (126&#8201;&#176;C for the lower) allowing the preparation of melt&#8208;processed thin films.







Abstract
Lead halide 2D hybrid perovskites (HP) have emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic and lighting applications. Solvent&#8208;free preparations offer greener route, but require congruent melting of halide perovskite for thin films, which has been demonstrated only for monolayered HP (n=1 of the (A)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 series) at the quite high temperature Tm (Tmelting) of 171&#8201;&#176;C. Here, we report on the solvent&#8208;free preparation (n=2, 4), thermal behaviour and melt&#8208;processed thin films of a series of HP (GABA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=1, 2, 4; GABA+: 4&#8208;ammoniumbutyric acid cation). The n=1 and n=2 HP have an exceptional low congruent Tm of 126&#8201;&#176;C and 136&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and, for n=1, a very good stability in the molten state. The liquid&#8211;solid reaction of molten (GABA)2PbI4 or (GABA)2(MA)Pb2I7 with MAPbI3 in 1/1 (T=130&#8201;&#176;C) or 1/2 (T=135&#8201;&#176;C) ratio leads to pure phases of the n=2 HP and (GABA)2(MA)3Pb4I11 (n=4, Tm=185&#8201;&#176;C), respectively. Melt&#8208;processed thin films of n=1, n=2 and n=4 HP have also been prepared.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Customized Pore Chemistry and Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures is realized by a multifunctional MOF material via specific binding and shape matching. High adsorption selectivity and trapping capacity towards C2H6 and C2H2 are simultaneously realized, which permits the high&#8208;efficient separation of C2H4 with a record productivity.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for the separation of C2 hydrocarbons. However, it remains a critical problem to directly produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures by simultaneously trapping C2H2 and C2H6. Herein, we report the one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from the ternary mixture by a metal&#8211;organic framework Zn(ad)(int) (ad=adeninate; int=isonicotinate). The material combines dense heterocyclic rings and accessible uncoordinated O atoms as strong binding sites for C2H6 and C2H2. Its spindle&#8208;like cage exhibits an interesting shape matching with the targeted molecules, affording Zn(ad)(int) not only high separation selectivity for C2H6/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4, but also excellent gas capacity. Breakthrough experiments show that polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 can be separated from the ternary mixtures with a record productivity of 1.43&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrum analyses further provide deep insights into the separation mechanism.

         <title>Steering Catalytic Activity and Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas with Hydroxy&#8208;Rich Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 Double&#8208;Shelled Nanoboxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes are synthesized through a multistep strategy to regulate the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction into syngas. The hierarchical hollow structure and p&#8211;n heterojunction enable enhanced light absorption and fast charge separation. Moreover, the catalytic activity can be tuned by controlling the content of hydroxy groups on the surfaces of ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3.







Abstract
Simultaneous transformation of CO2 and H2O into syngas (CO and H2) using solar power is desirable for industrial applications. Herein, an efficient photocatalyst based on double&#8208;shelled nanoboxes, with an outer shell of hydroxy&#8208;rich nickel cobaltite nanosheets and an inner shell of Cu2S (Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3), is prepared via a multistep templating strategy. The high performance of Cu2S@ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 (7.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CO; 2.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2) is attributed to the hierarchical hollow geometry and p&#8211;n heterojunction to promote light absorption and charge separation. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses elucidate that the ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 surface enhances *CO2 adsorption and lowers energy barriers for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. Therefore, modulating the hydroxy contents of ROH&#8208;NiCo2O3 can achieve broad CO/H2 ratios from 0.51 to 1.24. This work offers in&#8208;depth insights into adjustable syngas photosynthesis and generalized concepts of selective heterogeneous CO2 photoreduction beyond cobalt&#8208;based oxides.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Sulfur&#8208;Bridged Polycyclic Emitters Towards Tunable TADF and RTP Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating powerful electron&#8208;donating sulfur atoms into isomeric pentaphene and pentacene frameworks, three highly efficient polycyclic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and mixed TADF/RTP molecules were developed for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Highly efficient organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) generally consist of a twisted donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton with aromatic amine donors. Herein, through introducing sulfur atoms into isomeric pentaphene and pentacene frameworks, we demonstrate a set of polycyclic luminophores exhibiting efficient TADF and RTP characters. The incorporation of sulfur atoms confirms a folded molecular plane, while intensifies singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Further, the isomeric effect has a significant effect on the electronic structure of excited state, giving rise to the investigated compounds tunable luminescence mechanisms of TADF and RTP. With efficient triplet harvesting ability, maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 25.1&#8201;% and 8.7&#8201;% are achieved for the corresponding TADF and RTP OLEDs, verifying the great potential of sulfur&#8208;bridged frameworks for highly efficient devices.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Demystification of Radical Catalysis by a Coenzyme B12 Dependent Enzyme&#8212;Crystallographic Study of Glutamate Mutase with Cofactor Homologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glutamate mutase (GM) catalyses the interconversion of glutamate and 3&#8208;methylaspartate. It binds its B12&#8208;cofactor AdoCbl with an essential misfit for its Ado&#8208;group, liberating the clamped down aggressive Ado&#8208;radical in a tight reaction space to even promote &#8220;negative catalysis&#8221;. A &#8220;simply stretched&#8221; AdoCbl&#8208;homolog, in contrast, fits GM, freezing up the intriguing functional structure of this enzyme.







Abstract
Catalysis by radical enzymes dependent on coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) relies on the reactive primary 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;adenosyl radical, which originates from reversible Co&#8722;C bond homolysis of AdoCbl. This bond homolysis is accelerated roughly 1012&#8208;fold upon binding the enzyme substrate. The structural basis for this activation is still strikingly enigmatic. As revealed here, a displaced firm adenosine binding cavity in substrate&#8208;loaded glutamate mutase (GM) causes a structural misfit for intact AdoCbl that is relieved by the homolytic Co&#8722;C bond cleavage. Strategically interacting adjacent adenosine&#8208; and substrate&#8208;binding protein cavities provide a tight caged radical reaction space, controlling the entire radical path. The GM active site is perfectly structured for promoting radical catalysis, including &#8220;negative catalysis&#8221;, a paradigm for AdoCbl&#8208;dependent mutases.

         <title>Photocycloaddition as a Tool for Modulation of the Lower Critical Solution Temperature in a Molecular &#960;&#8208;System to Control Transmission of Solar Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow [4+2] photocycloaddition of an amphiphilic anthracene derivative (9&#8208;PA&#8208;1) leads to a bolaamphiphile, 9&#8208;PA&#8208;2. Both molecules exhibited reversible transition between transparent and opaque states within 25&#8211;35&#8201;&#176;C, allowing the construction of smart windows that control the transmission of solar radiation.







Abstract
Diels&#8211;Alder photocycloaddition, a well&#8208;known textbook reaction, has not been explored in materials chemistry. Herein we describe how this classical photochemistry can be used to modulate the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of a molecular &#960;&#8208;system, which can further be exploited for the controlled transmission of solar radiation for the management of indoor heat and light. An amphiphilic anthracene derivative 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 exhibited LCST behavior at 27&#8211;32&#8201;&#176;C with a reversible transition from a transparent to an opaque phase in water (1&#8211;5&#8197;mM). Irradiation of a toluene solution of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 with 365&#8197;nm light resulted in a [4+2] photocycloadduct 9&#8208;PA&#8208;2, which exhibited a modulated LCST behavior at 25&#8211;27&#8201;&#176;C, at a concentration as low as 6&#8197;&#956;M. The photocycloaddition of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 was significantly retarded in water, making it a stable candidate for the design of sustainable smart windows. We also demonstrated 100&#8197;cm2 smart window prototypes (&#916;Tlum 82&#8201;%, &#916;TIR 68&#8201;%, &#916;Tsol 73&#8201;%) with more than 1000&#8197;cycles of stable operation.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Cells Enabled by Rationally Tuning Lithium Polysulfide Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complexation reaction between metal iodide and lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte enables an effective stabilization of the anode with enhanced sulfur utilization in anode&#8208;free lithium&#8211;sulfur cells with lithium sulfide cathode.







Abstract
The two major barriers of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are the poor reversibility of lithium&#8208;metal anode and sluggish kinetics of sulfur cathode. Here, we report a simple yet cogent, molecular tailoring approach for lithium polysulfides, enabling a synergistic enhancement of anode reversibility and cathode kinetics. We show that SnI4 coordinates with lithium polysulfides to form soluble complexes, resulting in a Li2SnS3&#8208;rich anode interphase layer. As Li2SnS3 is stable against parasitic reactions and has a lower ionic resistance over cycling, the Li plating/stripping efficiency is greatly improved. In addition, the formation of soluble complexes between SnI4 and lithium polysulfides play a non&#8208;negligible role in suppressing the clustering behavior of lithium polysulfide molecules, resulting in a significant enhancement in sulfur conversion kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The synergistic improvement is validated in anode&#8208;free, lean&#8208;electrolyte pouch cells with a Li2S cathode that displays capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic strategy for hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis using trisubstituted selenonium salts as electrophilic chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is reported. 1,2&#8208;Oxaselenoliums can activate &#960;&#8208;systems in three classes of metal&#8208;free cyclization and addition via unconventional seleniranium intermediates. The counter anion has a significant effect on catalysis.







Abstract
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study of hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis was performed. A new catalytic strategy using 1,2&#8208;oxaselenolium salts as chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is described. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the use of trisubstituted selenonium salts in the metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrofunctionalization and polymerization of alkenes via unconventional seleniranium ion&#8208;like intermediates. The results indicate that counter anions have a significant effect on the catalysis based on hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions.

&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept catalytic strategy for hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis using trisubstituted selenonium salts as electrophilic chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is reported. 1,2-Oxaselenoliums can activate &#960;-systems in three classes of metal-free cyclization and addition via unconventional seleniranium intermediates. The counter anion has a significant effect on catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept study of hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis was performed. A new catalytic strategy using 1,2-oxaselenolium salts as chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is described. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the use of trisubstituted selenonium salts in the metal-free catalytic hydrofunctionalization and polymerization of alkenes via unconventional seleniranium ion-like intermediates. The results indicate that counter anions have a significant effect on the catalysis based on hypervalent chalcogenonium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Seeded Polymerization in Block Copolymer Nanoparticles: Post&#8208;Assembly Control of Colloidal Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's all about location: A new synthetic platform confines seeded polymerizations to one specific domain type in phase&#8208;separated block copolymer particles. Starting from one set of preformed particles, this post&#8208;assembly modification method enables accurate control over colloidal shape, morphology, and chemical functionality.







Abstract
Post&#8208;assembly modifications are efficient tools to adjust colloidal features of block copolymer (BCP) particles. However, existing methods often address particle shape, morphology, and chemical functionality individually. For simultaneous control, we transferred the concept of seeded polymerization to phase separated BCP particles. Key to our approach is the regioselective polymerization of (functional) monomers inside specific BCP domains. This was demonstrated in striped PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP ellipsoids. Here, polymerization of styrene preferably occurs in PS domains and increases PS lamellar thickness up to 5&#8208;fold. The resulting asymmetric lamellar morphology also changes the particle shape, i.e., increases the aspect ratio. Using 4&#8208;vinylbenzyl azide as co&#8208;monomer, azides as chemical functionalities can be added selectively to the PS domains. Overall, our simple and versatile method gives access to various multifunctional BCP colloids from a single batch of pre&#8208;formed particles.

         <title>Functional Droplets Stabilized by Interfacially Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial chiral assembly route has been developed to produce chiroptical droplets with multiple functions. Chiral triphenylamine monomers are polymerized supramolecularly using &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the phenyl groups as a trigger. Translation of the chirality of organic molecules to asymmetric nanoparticle assemblies across a liquid&#8211;liquid interface affords chiral nanocomposites stabilized at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.







Abstract
Here, we show that aqueous dispersions of inorganic nanoparticles bearing negative surface charges would trigger the chiral assembly of organic radical cations solubilized in organic solvent at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface, which consequently produces stable droplets covered by a layer of inorganic/organic chiral nanocomposites. We demonstrate that chirality transfer across the liquid&#8211;liquid interface from the chiral organic monomers to the nanoparticle assemblies is realized. Surprisingly, opposite handedness between molecular assemblies and nanoparticle assemblies is determined from both CD and CPL measurements. Moreover, the functionalities of these &#8220;chiral&#8221; droplets could be further engineered through either a simple mixing or a droplet merging strategy, which enables to produce fluorescent emissive&#8208;tunable, magnetic, as well as magnetofluorescent dual&#8208;functional droplets.

         <title>Oxidative Elimination and Reductive Addition of Thiol&#8208;Terminated Polymer Ligands to Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative elimination of thiol&#8208;terminated polymers from Au nanoparticle (NP) surfaces occurs due to the oxidation of the surface metal atoms and breakage of Au&#8722;Au bonds, and leads to NP aggregation, while reductive addition is used to attach freshly added polymers to the metal surface and restabilize aggregated NPs. This oxidative elimination and reductive addition (OERA) strategy enables improvement of the long&#8208;term NP stability and redox&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly of NPs.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with thiol&#8208; (HS&#8208;) terminated polymers have applications in medicine, optoelectronics, and catalysis. It is assumed that upon exposure to oxidants or even air, these NPs lose colloidal stability, due to the oxidation of the HS&#8208;end&#8208;group and elimination of polymer ligands from the NP surface, however, this mechanism does not explain the unsuccessful recovery of the NP stability by adding fresh HS&#8208;terminated polymers. Here we propose the oxidation of the surface metal atoms as a mechanism for the oxidative elimination of polymer from the NP surface. Based on this mechanism, we reversed NP aggregation by reducing the oxidized metal surface and re&#8208;attaching HS&#8208;terminated polymer ligands. This mechanism is general for various metal NPs and different HS&#8208;terminated polymers. We show that oxidative elimination and reductive addition reactions can improve the colloidal stability of polymer&#8208;capped metal NPs and control their redox stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Engineering a Local Free Water Enriched Microenvironment for Surpassing Platinum Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni3C heterostructure as a prototype, the introduction of a local hydrogen bond force field at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface is proposed to create a free H2O molecule enriched microenvironment near the inner Helmholtz plane. Continuous replenishment of free H2O molecules for the catalytic site achieved highly alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ &#8776;276&#8197;mV), outperforming Pt/C catalysts.







Abstract
Manipulating the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface to push reactants into the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) is highly desirable for efficient electrocatalysts, however, it has rarely been implemented due to the elusive electrochemical IHP and inherent inert catalyst surface. Here, we propose the introduction of local force fields by the surface hydroxyl group to engineer the electrochemical microenvironment and enhance alkaline hydrogen evolution activity. Taking a hydroxyl group immobilized Ni/Ni3C heterostructure as a prototype, we reveal that the local hydrogen bond induced by the surface hydroxyl group drags 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O molecules across the IHP to become free H2O and thus continuously supply reactants forcatalytic sites catalytic sites. In addition, the hydroxyl group coupled with the Ni/Ni3C heterostructure further lowers the water dissociation energy by polarization effects. As a direct outcome, hydroxyl&#8208;rich catalysts surpass Pt/C activity at high current density (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ &#8776;276&#8197;mV) in alkaline medium.

         <title>Discovery of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Beticolin 1 Reveals a Novel Non&#8208;heme Iron&#8208;dependent Oxygenase for Anthraquinone Ring Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study used light&#8208;mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in Cercospora. It contains an anthraquinone moiety and an unusual halogenated xanthone moiety connected by a bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane. During elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, a novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 responsible for anthraquinone ring cleavage was discovered. More importantly, the discovery of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 is well supported by experimental evidence: (i) crystal structure and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that its reactive site is built by an atypical iron ion coordination, where the iron ion is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water; (ii) Kcx377 is mediated by His58 and Thr299 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Therefore, we believed this study updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Selective Electrocarboxylation of Styrene Oxides with CO2 for Accessing &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2  in an undivided cell is reported. This reaction shows broad substrate scopes within styrene oxides under mild conditions, providing practical and scalable access to important synthetic intermediate  &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. Mechanistic studies show that CO2  functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. Cathodically generated  &#945;&#8208;radical and  &#945;&#8208;carbanion intermediates lead to the regioselective formation of  &#945;&#8208;carboxylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Phosphors Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Chains Showing Solid&#8208;State Photoluminescence Efficiency Exceeding 99%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermochromic phosphors are intriguing materials for realizing thermochromic behaviors of light&#8208;emitting diodes. Here a highly luminescent and stable thermochromic phosphor based on one&#8208;dimensional &#160; Cu  4  I  6  (4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)  2  &#160;is reported. This unique ionic copper&#8208;iodine &#160;chain&#8208;based hybrid exhibits near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency owing to through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer character of relevant electronic transitions. More importantly, an alternative mechanism of thermochromic phosphorescence was unraveled, supported by first principle simulation of concerted copper atom migration in the copper&#8208;iodine chain. Furthermore, we successfully fabricate a bright thermochromic light&#8208;emitting diode using this Cu  4  I  6  (4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)  2  thermochromic phosphor. Our reported flexible ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based thermochromic luminescent material represents a new type of cost&#8208;effective functional phosphor.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Chiral Allylboronates by  Asymmetric 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization&#160;of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a modular catalytic method for the efficient enantioselective synthesis of chiral allylboronates from abundant feedstock chemicals through an asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes. This protocol is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, mild and convenient reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, scalability and practicality. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of key intermediates of complex drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that  &#946;  &#8208;H elimination is a highly regioselective step and the reversible homolysis and convergance to the lower energy pre&#8208;reductive elimination intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromic Tetracoordinate Boron Complex: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission in purely organic luminophors remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a tetracoordinate boron complex with polymorphism (Y&#8208;phase and O&#8208;phase)&#8208;dependent luminescence.&#160; Impressively, Y&#8208;phase crystals exhibited rare piezochromic luminescent properties of pressure&#8208;induced photoluminescence blue&#8208;shift and enhancement. Theoretical and experimental tests demonstrate that this phenomenon results from the cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and alterable charge transfer behaviour during compression. This work provides an ideal model to investigate the optoelectronic properties of boron complexes. Importantly, manipulating the CT behaviour through the electrophilicity of boron atom may become a new principle for the design of piezochromic materials with blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Adsorption: Reducing the Poisoning Effect of Adsorbed Hydroxyl on Ru Single&#8208;Atom Site with SnO2 for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium (Ru) has been theoretically considered a viable alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst due to its fast water dissociation kinetics. However, its strong affinity to the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) blocks the active sites, resulting in unsatisfactory performance during the practical HER process. Here, we first reported a competitive adsorption strategy for the construction of SnO2&#160;nanoparticles doped with Ru single&#8208;atoms supported on carbon (Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2/C) via atomic galvanic replacement. SnO2  was introduced to regulate the strong interaction between Ru and OH  ad  by the competitive adsorption of OHad  between Ru and SnO2  , which alleviated the poisoning of Ru sites. As a consequence, the Ru SAs&#8208;SnO2  /C exhibited a low overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  (10 mV) and a low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec&#8208;1  . This approach provides a new avenue to modulate the adsorption strength of active sites and intermediates, which paves the way for the development of highly active electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Responsive Peptide Nanofibers with Theranostic and Prognostic Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a highly promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive photosensitizer nanomaterials overcomes certain limitations in clinical PDT. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly sensitive PEGylated photosensitizer&#8208;peptide nanofiber (termed PHHPEG  6  NF) that selectively aggregates in the acidic tumor and lysosomal microenvironment.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a highly promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. The development of stimuli-responsive photosensitizer nanomaterials overcomes certain limitations in clinical PDT. Herein, we report the rational design of a highly sensitive PEGylated photosensitizer-peptide nanofiber (termed PHHPEG  6  NF) that selectively aggregates in the acidic tumor and lysosomal microenvironment. These nanofibers exhibit acid-induced enhanced singlet oxygen generation, cellular uptake, and PDT efficacy  in vitro  , as well as fast tumor accumulation, long-term tumor imaging capacity and effective PDT  in vivo  . Moreover, based on the prolonged presence of the fluorescent signal at the tumor site, we demonstrate that PHHPEG  6  NFs can also be applied for prognostic monitoring of the efficacy of PDT  in vivo  , which would potentially guide cancer treatment. Therefore, these multifunctional PHHPEG  6  NFs allow control over the entire PDT process, from visualization of photosensitizer accumulation,  via  actual PDT to the assessment of the efficacy of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Perfluororhodacyclopentanes: High Nucleophilicity of M&#8208;CF Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP&#8208;RhIII(CF2)4 (2) was prepared from PBP&#8208;RhI&#8208;PPh3 (1) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8211;CF bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position. Although M&#8211;CF bonds of perfluorometallacyclopentanes are known to be very stable, 2 shows high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis, thanks to the strong trans&#8208;effect of the highly s&#8208;donating boryl ligand.

         <title>Evidence for C&#8211;F Bond Formation through Formal Reductive Elimination from Tellurium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental challenge of C&#8208;F bond formation by reductive elimination has been met by compounds of select transition metals and fewer main group elements. The work detailed herein expands the list of  main group elements known to be capable of reductively eliminating a C&#8208;F bond  to include tellurium. Surprising and novel modes of both sp  2  and sp  3  C&#8208;F bond formation were observed alongside formation of Te(IV) cations during two separate attempts to synthesize/characterize fluorinated organotellurium(VI) cations in superacidic media (SbF  5  /SO  2  ClF). Following detailed low&#8208;temperature NMR experiments, the mechanisms of the two unique reductive elimination reactions were probed and investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ultimately, we found that an &#8220;indirect&#8221; reductive elimination pathway is likely operative whereby Sb plays a key role in fluoride abstraction and C&#8208;F bond formation, as opposed to unimolecular reductive elimination from a discrete Te(VI) cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence from Chiral Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators display radioluminescent properties when irradiated by high&#8208;energy photons and therefore play an essential role in radiation detection. The current inventory of scintillators is overwhelmingly represented by achiral structures, where the radioluminescence propagates isotropically after generation. Herein, we demonstrate that chiral perovskites of (R&#8208;3AP)PbBr  3  Cl&#8226;H  2  O (  R&#8208;3APP  ) and (S&#8208;3AP)PbBr  3  Cl&#8226;H  2  O (  S&#8208;3APP  ) emerge as a new type of scintillator displaying a distinct property of circularly polarized radioluminescence (  CPRL  ). A high quantum yield of 27.6%, high luminescence dissymmetric factors (  g  lum  ) of 4&#215;10  &#8208;2  , and high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficient were observed for these compounds. As proof of concept, we fabricated a polarized scintillator pair by assembling chiral scintillator crystals, which provides a new strategy to attenuate optical crosstalk between the scintillators by precisely controlling the radioluminescence propagation and improves the X&#8208;ray imaging quality at the boundary region.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Disproportionation of 1,2&#8208;Diphenylhydrazine at a PV&#8208;Center
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented P&#8208;based catalyst able to promote hydrazine disproportionation has been synthesized. The available set of experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that this reactivity is unlocked by the cooperation between a redox&#8208;active bis(amidophenolate) ligand and the highly electrophilic central P&#8208;atom.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis of a nearly square&#8208;pyramidal chlorophosphorane supported by the tetradentate bis(amidophenolate) ligand, N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)&#8208;1,2&#8208;phenylenediamide. After chloride abstraction the resulting phosphonium cation efficiently promotes the disproportionation of 1,2&#8208;diphenylhydrazine to aniline and azobenzene. Mechanistic studies, spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations suggest that this unprecedented reactivity mode for PV&#8208;centres is induced by the high electrophilicity at the cationic PV&#8208;center, which originates from the geometry constraints imposed by the rigid pincer ligand, combined with the ability of the o&#8208;amidophenolate moieties to act as electron reservoir. This study illustrates the promising role of cooperativity between redox&#8208;active ligands and phosphorus for the design of organocatalysts able to promote redox processes.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time In Situ Demonstration of Direct and Indirect Transformation Pathways in CdTe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When CdTe MSC&#8208;448 transforms to MSC&#8208;488, the redshift of optical absorption that is monitored in real&#8208;time displays continuous (Pattern 1) and/or step&#8208;wise behavior (Pattern 2). The former transformation (Pathway 1) is direct and intra&#8208;cluster with a relatively large energy barrier. The latter transformation (Pathway 2) is indirect and assisted by MSC precursor compounds (PCs).







Abstract
The transformations of colloidal semiconductor magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) are expected to occur with only discrete, step&#8208;wise redshifts in optical absorption. Here, we challenge this assumption presenting a novel, conceptually different transformation, for which the redshift is continuous. In the room&#8208;temperature transformation from CdTe MSC&#8208;448 to MSC&#8208;488 (designated by the peak wavelengths in nanometer), the redshift of absorption monitored in situ displays distinctly continuous and/or step&#8208;wise behavior. Based on conclusive evidence provided by real&#8208;time experiments, the former transformation is apparently direct and intra&#8208;cluster with a relatively large energy barrier. The latter transformation is indirect and assisted by MSC precursor compounds (PCs). The former transformation follows the latter often, being predominant at a relatively high temperature. The present findings encourage a reconsideration of the absorption redshift reported previously for transformations of binary II&#8211;VI MSCs, together with the pathway associated without the increase of cluster mass.

         <title>Borane/Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization Reactions and Cycloaddition Reactions of Amines and &#945;&#8208;Alkynylenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;furyl 1,3&#8208;dipoles generated in situ from &#945;&#8208;alkynylenones and gold catalysts were successfully used for borane&#8208;catalyzed amine C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, giving amine derivatives bearing a furan ring. The reactions took place either via an &#945;&#8208;furylation pathway or via a [3+2] cycloaddition pathway, depending on the alkyl groups attached to the amine.







Abstract
We designed a borane/gold(I) co&#8208;catalytic system and used it for C&#8722;H functionalization reactions and cycloaddition reactions between tertiary amines and &#945;&#8208;alkynylenones. Both reactions effectively incorporated a furan ring into the amine.

         <title>Enhancing Li+ Transport in NMC811||Graphite Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low temperatures by Using Low&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Solvent Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;polarity&#8208;solvent electrolytes (LPSEs) 1) enable the formation of the anion&#8208;derived interphases on both electrodes and 2) have weak interactions between the solvent molecules and Li+, which provide fast Li+ transport kinetics and reduced resistance in both charge transfer process and Li+ transport in electrode/electrolyte interphases, achieving excellent battery performance under both fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature conditions.







Abstract
LiNixCoyMnzO2 (x+y+z=1)||graphite lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) chemistry promises practical applications. However, its low&#8208;temperature (&#8804; &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) performance is poor because the increased resistance encountered by Li+ transport in and across the bulk electrolytes and the electrolyte/electrode interphases induces capacity loss and battery failures. Though tremendous efforts have been made, there is still no effective way to reduce the charge transfer resistance (Rct) which dominates low&#8208;temperature LIBs performance. Herein, we propose a strategy of using low&#8208;polarity&#8208;solvent electrolytes which have weak interactions between the solvents and the Li+ to reduce Rct, achieving facile Li+ transport at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The exemplary electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||graphite cells to deliver a capacity of &#8776;113&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (98&#8201;% full&#8208;cell capacity) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and to remain 82&#8201;% of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C without lithium plating at 1/3C. They also retain 84&#8201;% of their capacity at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 78&#8201;% of their capacity at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and show stable cycling at 50&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Driven Small&#8208;Molecule Nanotransformer Hijacks Lysosomes and Overcomes Autophagy&#8208;Induced Resistance in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lysosomal targeting nonpeptide PBC (pheophorbide a&#8211;bisaminoquinoline conjugate) self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles at physiological pH and then transforms into nanofibrils upon the trigger of lysosomal pH. Due to such shape transformation, PBC not only inhibits tumor growth as a single agent but also mediates a convenient photodynamic therapy with promise to overcome the autophagy&#8208;induced resistance and achieve tumor ablation.







Abstract
Smart conversion of supramolecular structures in vivo is an attractive strategy in cancer nanomedicine, which is usually achieved via specific peptide sequences. Here we developed a lysosomal targeting small&#8208;molecule conjugate, PBC, which self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles at physiological pH and smartly converts to nanofibrils in lysosomes of tumor cells. Such a transformation mechanically leads to lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy inhibition, and unusual cytoplasmic vacuolation, thus granting PBC a unique anticancer activity as a monotherapy. Importantly, the photo&#8208;activated PBC elicits significant phototoxicity to lysosomes and shows enormous advantages in overcoming autophagy&#8208;caused treatment resistance frequently occurring in conventional phototherapy. This improved phototherapy achieves a complete cure of oral cancer xenografts upon limited administration. Our work provides a new paradigm for the construction of nonpeptide nanotransformers with biomedical activities.

         <dc:description>Here we report the synthesis of a trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole linked polymer using topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. We designed a&#160;cyclitol&#8208;derived&#160;monomer having an azide and an internal alkyne group. The four hydroxyl groups present in this monomer dictate its crystal packing such that the monomer molecules are head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arranged, placing the internal alkyne and the azide units of adjacent molecules proximally. Though the alignment of the reactive groups in the monomer crystal is not favourable for topochemical reaction, reactive orientation can be achieved by the rotation of reactive groups. Upon heating the crystals, the monomer underwent topochemical polymerization yielding&#160;&#160;&#160;trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole linked&#8208;polycyclitol. This report demonstrates a new synthetic strategy for the cycloaddition reaction between non&#8208;polarized internal alkynes and azides, yielding trisubstituted triazoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Blending the Optical and Redox Properties of Oligoynes and Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligoynes and polyynes are 1&#8208;D chains of conjugated  sp  &#8208;hybridized carbon atoms consisting of alternating single and triple bonds. Their stability rapidly decreases with increasing chain length beyond only a few repeating units. Design strategies, such as the use of bulky end&#8208;capping groups, allow for their characterization and isolation while not contributing significantly to their physical properties. In this study, we incorporate redox&#8208;active BF  2  formazanate dyes (  BF  2  ) as end&#8208;caps to prepare symmetric (  BF  2  &#8722;[C&#8801;C]  n  &#8722;BF  2  ) and asymmetric (  BF  2  &#8722;[C&#8801;C]  n  &#8722;Si(  i  Pr)  3  ) families of oligoynes containing up to 10 alkyne units. In doing so, we introduce stable oligoynes that possess a blend of optical and redox properties that cannot be achieved by either oligoynes or BF  2  formazanates individually (  e.g.  , panchromatic absorption, multiple and tunable reversible redox waves). This approach is transferable to other functional end&#8208;caps to facilitate the preparation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials with utility in the organic electronics arena.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Learning for Additive Screening in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering with organic molecules is of critical importance for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronic devices. However, experimentally finding suitable additives is costly and time consuming, while conventional machine learning (ML) is difficult to predict accurately due to the limited experimental data available in this relatively new field. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning method that can predict the effectiveness of additives in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with a high accuracy up to 96% by using a small dataset of 132 molecules. This model can maximize the information of the molecules and significantly mitigate the duplicated problem that usually happened with previous models in ML for molecular screening. Very high efficiency PeLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency up to 22.7% can be achieved by using the predicated additive. Our work opens a new avenue for further boosting the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification and Structure Analysis of an Unusual Halohydrin Dehalogenase for Highly Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Bio&#8208;Nitration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery of an unusual halohydrin dehalogenase, HHDHamb, that can work under relative low acidic conditions and extremely low temperatures&#160;for the bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides using nitrite as a nitrating agent. The bio&#8208;nitration strategy exhibits high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, catalyzing the kinetic resolution of various epoxides to enantiopure  &#946;  &#8208;nitroalcohols with nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters in up to 41% isolated yield and &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (  ee  ). Additionally, the bio&#8208;nitration method displays a high reaction efficiency and can be performed on a gram scale. We also solved the crystal structure of HHDHamb to understand the possible structural determinants of chemoselectivity control in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Schiff Base Mediated Dipeptide Assembly toward Nanoarchitectonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is fascinating because of its dual nature. It perfectly combines the reversible nature of noncovalent bonds with the robustness of covalent bonds, effectively enhancing the stability of assemblies and meanwhile giving rise to unprecedent properties. Therefore, integration of DCC with supramolecular chemistry has emerged as a versatile and an extraordinarily useful approach in directing peptide assembly. This minireview focuses on recent strategy, which exploits dynamic Schiff base chemistry in combination with supramolecular chemistry to mediate dipeptide assembly toward nanoarchitectonics. Diversified structures, new emergent properties and their related applications are highlighted. Lastly, the opportunities and prospects in this exciting field have also been introduced.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Bonding Nature in the Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Core&#8208;Shell Syngenetic &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique thorium&#8208;thorium bond was observed in the crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster [{Th(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2}3{K(THF)2}2]&#8734;, though the claim of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity for Th3 bond has been questioned. Herein, a new type of core&#8208;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the stability of this tri&#8208;thorium cluster. The model involves a 3c&#8208;2e bond in the Th3 core and a multicentered (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. To differentiate the strengths of the 3c&#8208;2e bond and the charge&#8208;shift bond, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method which falls into the ab initio valence bond (VB) theory is employed to construct a strictly core/shell localized state and its contributing covalent resonance structure for the Th3 core bond. By comparing with the &#963;&#8208;aromatic H3+ and nonaromatic Li3+, the computed resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies confirm that this Th3 core bond is truly delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven  para  &#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the  para  &#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solar Evaporation Using a Scalable MoS2&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Highly Efficient Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) was successfully constructed with a hydrophilic polyacrylamide as its skeleton and commercial MoS2 as the solar absorbent through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. The SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Interfacial photo&#8208;vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the high porosity (92.63&#8201;%), the SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination. Most importantly, the SMoS2&#8208;PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15&#8197;days on the surface of seawater. We believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial MoS2 make the SMoS2&#8208;PH a promising device for full&#8208;scale seawater desalination.

The SMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1-sun illumination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial photo-vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost-effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based porous hydrogel (SMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the high porosity (92.63&#8201;%), the SMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1-sun illumination. Most importantly, the SMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15&#8197;days on the surface of seawater. We believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; make the SMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PH a promising device for full-scale seawater desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress in recent years. Innovations in material design and device optimization have improved the power conversion efficiencies to over 19%. In this review, based on recent advances, we discuss molecular design strategies to tune the absorption spectrum, energy level, and intermolecular aggregation as well as highlight the role of molecular electrostatic potential in decreasing energy loss. Then, we introduce the latest progress in four types of OSCs composed of different donor:acceptor combinations: polymer donor:small&#8208;molecule acceptor, all&#8208;polymer, all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule, and small&#8208;molecule donor:polymer acceptor OSCs. Finally, the challenges of OSCs in practical applications, including material cost, stability, and multi&#8208;function integration, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Depletion of Tumorigenic Energy Sources Driven by Cascade Reactions for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose and lactate play important roles for tumor growth. How to simultaneously deprive glucose and lactate of tumors is a big challenge. Herein, we developed a cascade catalytic system (denoted as FPGLC) based on fluorinated polymer (FP) with co&#8208;loading of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx) and catalase (CAT). GOx and LOx deprive glucose and lactate, respectively, resulting in abundant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Meanwhile, CAT catalyzes H2O2 into O2, which not only promotes catalytic reactions of GOx and LOx for consuming more glucose and lactate, but also alleviates tumor hypoxia. Benefiting from the excellent cross&#8208;membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities of FP, FPGLC rapidly accumulated in tumors and subsequently mediated enhanced cascade catalytic therapy under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. These results demonstrate that the dual&#8208;depletion of glucose and lactate with O2 supply is a promising strategy for efficient antitumor starvation therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemically Generated Calcium&#8208;Based Heavy Grignard Reagents and Their Application to Carbon&#8722;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to the use of conventional magnesium&#8208;based Grignard reagents (R&#8722;MgX), the application of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents (R&#8722;CaX) in organic synthesis remains poorly explored. This is mainly due to the lack of experimentally simple ways to access such organocalcium nucleophiles from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. Here, we show that a mechanochemical technique using ball milling allows the generation of calcium&#8208;based heavy Grignard reagents from aryl halides and commercially available calcium metal without complicated pre&#8208;activation processes. Notably, all experimental operations can be carried out in air. Our operationally simple protocol enables the rapid development of novel cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by arylcalcium nucleophiles, which are rather difficult using conventional Grignard reagents. This method will allow synthetic chemists to readily access the novel and unique reactivity of organocalcium nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8211;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2  hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3  (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2  adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2  reaching about 30.4% with a CO selectivity of almost 100% at 500 &#176;C and very low H  2  partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3  is calculated to facilitate CO2  activation and reduces CO2  to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82 eV, substantially lower than that of CH4  formation (2.16 eV), accounting for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of the lack of atomic ensemble in Mo/NC. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2  conversion rate even after 68 h of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water gas shift reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new X&#8208;type ligand, i.e., organic sulfonium bromide, for high&#8208;efficiency CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 (MA = methylammonium) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). We first confirmed the facile synthesis of the titled ligands in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at room temperature. By reacting dodecylmethylsulfide with allyl bromide, (3&#8208;bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane, respectively, three representative ligands (named DAM, DSM, and DMM) are acquired. All of them result in CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 PNCs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and decent ambient stability (no less than 90% PLQY after 2 months) using a room&#8208;temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation technique. Among them, DSM and DMM endow CsPbBr3 PNCs with higher thermal/light stability arising from the cross&#8208;linkable or bidentate ligand structure. Further, DSM&#8208;CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene through in situ thermal polymerization and the composite shows a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanism to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, which are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This review is in prospected of providing suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8208;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8226;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825 nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by ~5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8226;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. Taking the reversibility of 1&#8208;PAIN toward &#8226;OH/H2S redox couple, dynamic monitoring of the hepatic &#8226;OH and H2S fluctuation in mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS)&#8208;induced hepatitis and the following anti&#8208;inflammation process upon N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment is achieved. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Driven Rotatory Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are a major step towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized into molecular switches, rotors, motors and autonomous motors according to their type of responses. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Route to Dewar 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene and Subsequent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]  2  &#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (  1  ) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (  2  ) yields access to gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (  3  ). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of  3  to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (  3&#8217;  ), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (  3&#8217;&#8217;  ). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of  3  , a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Semisynthesis of Homogeneous, Active Granulocyte Colony&#8208;Stimulating Factor Glycoforms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G&#8208;CSF) is a cytokine used to treat neutropenia. Different glycosylated and non&#8208;glycosylated variants of G&#8208;CSF for therapeutic application are currently generated by recombinant expression. Here, we describe our approaches to establish a first semisynthesis strategy to access the aglycone and  O  &#8208;glycoforms of G&#8208;CSF, thereby enabling the preparation of selectively and homogeneously posttranslationally modified variants of this important cytokine. Eventually, we succeeded by combining selenocysteine ligation of a recombinantly produced N&#8208;terminal segment with a synthetic C&#8208;terminal part, transiently equipped with a sidechain&#8208;linked, photocleavable PEG moiety, at low concentration. The transient PEGylation enabled quantitative enzymatic elongation of the carbohydrate at Thr 133. Overall, we were able to significantly reduce the problems related to the low solubility and the tendency to aggregate of the two protein segments, which allowed the preparation of four G&#8208;CSF variants that were successfully folded and demonstrated biological activity in cell proliferation assays.</dc:description>

         <title>A Specialized Polythioamide&#8208;Binding Protein Confers Antibiotic Self&#8208;Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is critical for developing anti&#8208;infective therapies and genomics&#8208;based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain with respect to novel types of antibiotics from less explored producers such as anaerobes (clostridia). By genome editing and functional assays we found that CtaZ confers self&#8208;resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in  Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum.  Biochemical analyses, bioinformatics, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new subgroup of GyrI&#8208;like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand&#8208;optimized hydrophobic pocket, thus confining CTA. Genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered that previously overlooked homologs are widespread in Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing a new role of a GyrI&#8208;like domain in self&#8208;resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids uncovering related drug&#8208;resistance mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two&#8208;sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&#8211;3 to 5.1&#215;10&#8211;3 in a less dipolar methoxy&#8208;substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without C5&#8208;symmetry around one order of magnitude.</dc:description>
