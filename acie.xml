         <title>Boosting H+ Storage in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries via Integrating Redox&#8208;Active Sites into Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the emerging aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), proton (H+) with the smallest molar mass and fast (de)coordination kinetics is considered as the most ideal charge carrier compared with Zn2+ counterpart, however, searching for new hosting materials for H+ storage is still at its infancy. Herein, redox&#8208;active hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from diaminotriazine moiety decorated hexaazatrinnphthalene (HOF&#8208;HATN) are for the first time developed as the stable cathode hosting material for boosting H+ storage in AZIBs. The unique integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking endow it rapid Grotthuss proton conduction, stable supramolecular structure and inclined H+ storage. As a consequence, HOF&#8208;HATN displays a high capacity (320 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1) and robust cyclability of (&gt;10000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1) based on three&#8208;step cation coordination storage. These findings get insight into the proton transport and storage behavior in HOFs and provide the molecular engineering strategy for constructing well&#8208;defined cathode hosting materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Conformation of Dimeric Acceptors and Their Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimeric&#8208;type acceptors, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized with selenophone and thiophene as a bridge, respectively. Both exhibit O&#8208;shape conformation as determined by NMR and DFT simulations, which is driven by the robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of intramolecular terminal groups. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;DIBP3F&#8208;Se&#8208;based solar cell demonstrated an efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%.







Abstract
The determination of molecular conformations of oligomeric acceptors (OAs) and their impact on molecular packing are crucial for understanding the photovoltaic performance of their resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs) but have not been well studied yet. Herein, we synthesized two dimeric acceptor materials, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S, which bridged two segments of Y6&#8208;derivatives by selenophene and thiophene, respectively. Theoretical simulation and experimental 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic studies prove that both dimers exhibit O&#8208;shaped conformations other than S&#8208; or U&#8208;shaped counter&#8208;ones. Notably, this O&#8208;shaped conformation is likely governed by a distinctive &#8220;conformational lock&#8221; mechanism, arising from the intensified intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among their two terminal groups within the dimers. PSCs based on DIBP3F&#8208;Se deliver a maximum efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, outperforming DIBP3F&#8208;S&#8208;based cells (16.11&#8201;%) and ranking among the highest efficiencies for OA&#8208;based PSCs. This work demonstrates a facile method to obtain OA conformations and highlights the potential of dimeric acceptors for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Time&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Transformation (TTT) Diagram of Battery&#8208;Grade Li&#8208;Garnet Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Sustainable Synthesis</title>

The establishment of a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirms stabilization of cubic&#8208;phase LLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Technologically, the newly proposed low&#8208;temperature processing routes benefit the integration and scale&#8208;up of LLZO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries at reduced costs and carbon footprint.







Abstract
Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction, synthesized by crystal orientation control and heterostructure construction, shows unprecedented selectivity, activity, and stability for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination under ambient conditions. Using the presented protocol, a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxyl acids can be successfully converted into the corresponding amino acids.







Abstract
Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.

Edge&#8208;rich MoS2 is presented as a promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate with superior activity and stability. The selective formation of formate is enabled by using surface OH* and H* species from H2O dissociation on the edge&#8208;sulfur vacancies as moderate hydrogenating agents.







Abstract
Synthesis of formate from hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an atom&#8208;economic reaction but is confronted with challenges in developing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for application of the process. Herein, we report a highly durable edge&#8208;rich molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate at 200&#8201;&#176;C, which delivers a high selectivity of over 99&#8201;% with a superior turnover frequency of 780.7&#8197;h&#8722;1 surpassing those of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal catalysts. Multiple experimental characterization techniques combined with theoretical calculations reveal that sulfur vacancies at MoS2 edges are the active sites and the selective production of formate is enabled via a completely new water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation mechanism, in which surface OH* and H* species in dynamic equilibrium with water serve as moderate hydrogenating agents for CO2 with residual O* reduced by hydrogen. This study provides a new route for developing low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to formate.

         <title>Hydrogen Transport and Evolution in Ni&#8208;MH Batteries by Neutron Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;destructive and high&#8208;resolution methods allowing the investigation of battery systems are provided by operando neutron imaging combined with electrical monitoring of the state of charge. We track the exchange and transport of hydrogen in the electrodes and the evolution of hydrogen gas under operating conditions of a commercial Ni&#8208;mixed metal hydride battery.







Abstract
Efficiency losses due to side reactions are one of the main challenges in battery development. Despite providing valuable insights, the results of standard analysis on the individual components cannot be simply extrapolated to the full operating system. Therefore, non&#8208;destructive, and high resolution approaches that allow the investigation of the full system are desired. Herein, we combined neutron radiography and tomography with electrical monitoring of the state of charge of commercial Ni&#8208;mischmetal hydride batteries, to track the exchange and transport of hydrogen under operating conditions. This non&#8208;destructive approach allowed both the quantification of the hydrogen distribution in the electrodes in 4D, and the distinction between the electrochemically exchanged hydrogen and the hydrogen gas pressure generated by side reactions, as a function of the applied potential and current. One of the most counter&#8208;intuitive observation is that the generation of hydrogen gas during discharge depends on the charging state of the battery. The results presented provide critical new insights in the mechanisms governing the electrochemical processes during Nimischmetal hydride battery operation, and also pave the way for the extrapolation of this approach to the investigation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ions batteries.

         <title>Engineering Nucleotidoproteins for Base&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Assisted Cytosolic Delivery and Genome Editing</title>

         <dc:description>
A nucleotidoprotein engineered via facile &#8220;green synthesis&#8221; exhibits strong electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding with complementary base&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiency. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the nucleotidoprotein and consequently promotes the intracellular release of native protein.







Abstract
Protein therapeutics targeting intracellular machineries hold profound potential for disease treatment, and hence robust cytosolic protein delivery technologies are imperatively demanded. Inspired by the super&#8208;negatively charged, nucleotide&#8208;enriched structure of nucleic acids, adenylated pro&#8208;proteins (A&#8208;proteins) with dramatically enhanced negative surface charges have been engineered for the first time via facile green synthesis. Then, thymidine&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine is developed, which exhibits strong electrostatic attraction, complementary base pairing, and hydrophobic interaction with A&#8208;proteins to form salt&#8208;resistant nanocomplexes with robust cytosolic delivery efficiencies. The acidic endolysosomal environment enables traceless restoration of the A&#8208;proteins and consequently promotes the intracellular release of the native proteins. This strategy shows high efficiency and universality for a variety of proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points in mammalian cells. Moreover, it enables highly efficient delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins targeting fusion oncogene EWSR1&#8208;FLI1, leading to pronounced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy against Ewing sarcoma. This study provides a potent and versatile platform for cytosolic protein delivery and gene editing, and may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Porous Cyclodextrin Polymer Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

A solid polymer electrolyte based on non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect of CD&#8208;Si and double transmission channels is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth and shuttle effect of polyiodide, achieving outstanding cycle&#8208;stability of symmetrical batteries and ultralong&#8208;life solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;I2 batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared a new porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) can reach 1.64&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1200&#8197;h at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery shows an ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Crosstalk between Hepatic Glutathione Efflux and Tumor Targeting Efficiency of Indocyanine Green&#8208;Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

Crosstalk between the liver and tumor can significantly impact the tumor targeting efficiency of thiol&#8208;responsive nanoparticles through hepatic glutathione efflux.







Abstract
The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in solid tumors has been used as a major hallmark for GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity. Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how this hepatic GSH efflux affects the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive indocyanine green&#8208;conjugated Au25 nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG&#8208;Au25SG18). The dissociation of ICG from Au25SG18 by the hepatic GSH through thiol&#8208;exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG&#8208;Au25SG18 and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione&#8208;mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well&#8208;known Kupffer cell&#8208;mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.

Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how this hepatic GSH efflux affects the tumor targeting of GSH-responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH-responsive indocyanine green-conjugated Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG-Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;SG&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;). The dissociation of ICG from Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;SG&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; by the hepatic GSH through thiol-exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG-Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;SG&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione-mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well-known Kupffer cell-mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoluminescence of Mn2+ in the Borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4] : Mn2+&#8212;A Tool to Detect Weak Coordination Behavior of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence of Mn2+ is strongly affected by the ligand field. Usually only the metal&#8208;ligand distance is considered a tool to tune the ligand field strength in phosphors. Using Zn[B2(SO4)4] as a host, we show that electronic effects are an important alternative and lead to unusual orange luminescence of Mn2+.







Abstract
The impact of the surrounding ligand field is successfully exploited in the case of Eu2+ to tune the emission characteristics of inorganic photoactive materials with potential application in, e.g., phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;wLEDs). However, the photoluminescence of Mn2+ related to intraconfigurational 3d5&#8211;3d5 transitions is also strongly dependent on local ligand field effects and has been underestimated in this regard so far. In this work, we want to revive the idea how to electronically tune the emission color of a transition metal ion in inorganic hosts by unusual electronic effects in the metal&#8208;ligand bond. The concept is explicitly demonstrated for the weakly coordinating layer&#8208;like borosulfate ligand in the Mn2+&#8208;containing solid solutions Zn1&#8208;xMnx[B2(SO4)4] (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.10). Zn[B2(SO4)4]:Mn2+ shows orange narrow&#8208;band luminescence at 590&#8197;nm, which is an unusually short wavelength for octahedrally coordinated Mn2+ and indicates an uncommonly weak ligand field. On the other hand, the analysis of the interelectronic Racah repulsion parameters reveals ionic Mn&#8722;O bonds with values close to the Racah parameters of the free Mn2+ ion. Overall, this strategy demonstrates that electronic control of the metal&#8208;ligand bond can be a tool to make Mn2+ a potent alternative emitter to Eu2+ for inorganic phosphors.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;2D Layered Organic&#8208;Inorganic Manganese Bromide with a Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diode and X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered organic&#8211;inorganic manganese bromide with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high thermal quenching resistance was developed and explored as a green phosphor for wide color gamut light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and as a scintillator for sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, with performance superior to that of most commercial phosphors and scintillators, respectively.







Abstract
Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (I150&#8201;&#176;C=84.1&#8201;%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a wide color gamut of 116&#8201;% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8722;1, a detection limit of 82.4&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This work presents a new avenue for the exploration of eco&#8208;friendly luminescent OIMHs towards multifunctional light&#8208;emitting applications.

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the coordination stabilization of PAL ligands, the highly reversible high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;phase Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple is realized in near&#8208;neutral aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8722;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8722;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8722;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8722;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67&#8197;V but also exhibits excellent cyclability (100&#8201;% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8722;Mn battery high specific energy (600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8722;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8722;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.

         <title>Design of an Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photo&#8208;RAFT System for Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugation Achieving High Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

This study explores the effects of ROS on protein activity and secondary structure during photocatalysis. Specifically, it offers valuable insights into synthesizing protein&#8208;polymer conjugates while preserving high enzymatic activity under mild and aerobic conditions. The EY/TEOA system is identified as the optimal method for preparing conjugates, offering a simple and robust strategy with excellent oxygen tolerance in a minimal reaction volume.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo&#8208;initiated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (Photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin&#8197;Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo&#8208;RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity.

&lt;p&gt;This study explores the effects of ROS on protein activity and secondary structure during photocatalysis. Specifically, it offers valuable insights into synthesizing protein-polymer conjugates while preserving high enzymatic activity under mild and aerobic conditions. The EY/TEOA system is identified as the optimal method for preparing conjugates, offering a simple and robust strategy with excellent oxygen tolerance in a minimal reaction volume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (Photo-RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein-polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin&#8197;Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo-RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein-polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity. To showcase the potential of this approach, lysozyme-poly(dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) conjugates were successfully prepared and exhibited enhanced antimicrobial property against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superparamagnetic Composite Nanobeads Anchored with Molecular Glues for Ultrasensitive Label&#8208;free Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coverage of label&#8208;free proteomics for precious trace specimens is limited due to redundant pretreatments. We design molecular glue&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles equipped with protein anchors to capture proteins in complex trace biological samples. We propose a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) in one single tube to reduce protein loss for ultrasensitive proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry has emerged as a mainstream technique for label&#8208;free proteomics. However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95&#8201;%) and recovery (&#8776;90&#8201;%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified &#8776;1400 proteins from 5&#8197;&#956;L aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.

         <title>Directing the Selectivity of CO Electrolysis to Acetate by Constructing Metal&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;organic interface constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu phthalocyanine can direct the selectivity of CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product, with an acetate Faradaic efficiency (FE) as high as 84.2&#8201;%, a record acetate partial current density of 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an acetate yield up to 63.4&#8201;%. The impressive acetate selectivity is ascribed to the favorable reaction microenvironment created by the Cu&#8208;organic interface.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable chemicals holds great promise for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Owing to complex reaction pathways and shared rate&#8208;determining steps, directing the selectivity of CO2/CO electrolysis to a specific multicarbon product is very challenging. We report here a strategy for highly selective production of acetate from CO electrolysis by constructing metal&#8208;organic interfaces. We demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;organic interfaces constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu complexes show very impressive acetate selectivity, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;% and a carbon selectivity of 92.1&#8201;% for acetate production, in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The maximum acetate partial current density and acetate yield reach as high as 605&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 63.4&#8201;%, respectively. Thorough structural characterizations, control experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculation results indicate that the Cu&#8208;organic interface creates a favorable reaction microenvironment that enhances *CO adsorption, lowers the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling, and facilitates the formation of CH3COOH over other multicarbon products, thus rationalizing the selective acetate production.

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron&#8208;rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (PC), structurally complex cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity&#8208;mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported to realize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission by incorporating B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O heterocycles as fusion lockers into conventional multi&#8208;resonant frameworks. Three emitters exhibited bright sky&#8208;blue emission with remarkably small full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of only 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm in solution. A high&#8208;performance OLED device was achieved with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm and a high EQE of up to 31.9&#8201;% with alleviated efficiency attenuation.







Abstract
Fusing condensed aromatics into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) frameworks has been an exquisite strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties, which, however, always sacrifices the small full width at half maxima (FWHM). Herein, we strategically embed B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O contained heterocycles as fusion locker into classical MR prototypes, which could enlarge the &#960;&#8208;extension and alleviate the steric repulsion for an enhanced planar skeleton to suppress the high&#8208;frequency stretching/ scissoring vibrations for ultra&#8208;narrowband emissions. Sky&#8208;blue emitters with extremely small FWHMs of 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm are thereafter obtained for the targeted emitters, decreased by (1.4&#8211;1.9)&#8208;fold compared with the prototypes. Benefiting from their high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and fast radiative decay rates of &gt;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, one of those emitters shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.9&#8201;% in sensitized devices, which remains 25.8&#8201;% at a practical luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm. Notably a long operation half&#8208;lifetime of 1,278&#8197;h is also recorded for the same device, representing one of the longest lifetimes among sky&#8208;blue devices based on MR emitters.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aminomethylation of Alkyl Halides Enabled by Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed aminomethylation of alkyl halides was realized for the synthesis of tertiary amines bearing bulky substituents and it involves radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The bulky N&#8208;substituents serve as an activation group to overcome the redox&#8208;potential barrier in these reactions, allowing synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines.







Abstract
The catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.

         <title>Tetracopper &#963;&#8208;Bound &#956;&#8208;Acetylide and &#8208;Diyne Units Stabilized by a Naphthyridine&#8208;based Dinucleating Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Reaction of two equivalents of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide species with an appropriate acetylide synthon allowed the rational synthesis of a molecular tetracopper(I) acetylide, which possesses an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode. This geometry opens the door to higher nuclearity homo&#8208; or heterometallic architectures, as demonstrated by the formation of a pentacopper(I) complex.







Abstract
Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#956;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal&#8208;metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne&#8208;containing clusters.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Afterglow for White&#8208;Light Emission and Information Encryption Based on Carbazole Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delayed fluorescence usually showed much shorter lifetime than phosphorescence in organic afterglow. An effective strategy is presented in this work to prolong the lifetime of delayed fluorescence to approach that of phosphorescence, which enables great color tunability of organic afterglow from yellow to white by changing the temperature.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;mode emission materials, combining phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, offer promising opportunities for white&#8208;light afterglow. However, the delayed fluorescence lifetime is usually significantly shorter than that of phosphorescence, limiting the duration of white&#8208;light emission. In this study, a carbazole&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system that can be activated by both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light is reported to achieve balanced phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, resulting in a long&#8208;lived white&#8208;light afterglow. Our study demonstrated the critical role of a charge transfer state in the afterglow mechanism, where the charge separation and recombination process directly determined the lifetime of afterglow. Simultaneously, an efficient reversed intersystem crossing process was obtained between the singlet and triplet charge transfer states, which facilitating the delayed fluorescence properties of host&#8211;guest system. As a result, delayed fluorescence lifetime was successfully prolonged to approach that of phosphorescence. This work presents a delayed fluorescence lifetime improvement strategy via doping method to realize durable white&#8208;light afterglow.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Functionalized Fe4L6 Cages for Supramolecular Gold Catalyst Encapsulation to Control Substrate Activation Modes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate&#8208;functionalized gold catalyst and urea substrate have been found to be encapsulated in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage through hydrogen bonding. The caged catalyst presents excellent performances compared to the free catalyst, with high selectivity obtained from the site&#8208;isolation effect imposed by the cage only allowing catalysis by &#960; activation of the substrate. The high reactivity arises from stabilization of the transition state.







Abstract
The excellent catalytic performances of enzymes in terms of activity and selectivity are an inspiration for synthetic chemists and this has resulted in the development of synthetic containers for supramolecular catalysis. In such containers the local environment and pre&#8208;organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co&#8208;encapsulate a functionalized urea substrate through hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained, imposed by the cage as site isolation only allows catalysis through &#960; activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transitionstate stabilization rather than substrate pre&#8208;organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions, for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.

         <title>Photoinduced Cobalt Catalysis for the Reductive Coupling of Pyridines and Dienes Enabled by Paired Single&#8208;Electron Transfer
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, regioselective method for the hydropyridylation of diene feedstocks is reported, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalisation. Experiments and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving non&#8208;reversible hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in a reaction that is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins.







Abstract
Selective hydroarylation of dienes has potential to provide swift access to useful building blocks. However, most existing methods rely on dienes stabilised by an aromatic group and transmetallation or nucleophilic attack steps require electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners. As such, there are few examples which tolerate wide&#8208;spread heteroarenes such as pyridine. Whilst allylic C&#8722;H functionalisation could be considered an alternative approach, the positional selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates is hard to control. Here, we report a general approach for selective hydropyridylation of dienes under mild conditions using metal catalysed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

&lt;p&gt;A mild, regioselective method for the hydropyridylation of diene feedstocks is reported, and is amenable to late-stage-functionalisation. Experiments and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving non-reversible hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in a reaction that is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective hydroarylation of dienes has potential to provide swift access to useful building blocks. However, most existing methods rely on dienes stabilised by an aromatic group and transmetallation or nucleophilic attack steps require electron-rich aryl coupling partners. As such, there are few examples which tolerate wide-spread heteroarenes such as pyridine. Whilst allylic C&#8722;H functionalisation could be considered an alternative approach, the positional selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates is hard to control. Here, we report a general approach for selective hydropyridylation of dienes under mild conditions using metal catalysed hydrogen-atom transfer. Photoinduced, reductive conditions enable simultaneous formation of a cobalt-hydride catalyst and the persistent radical of easily-synthesised pyridyl phosphonium salts. This facilitates selective coupling of dienes in a traceless manner at the C4-position of a wide-range of pyridine substrates. The mildness of the method is underscored by its functional-group tolerance and demonstrated by applications in late-stage functionalisation. Based on a combination of experimental and computational studies, we propose a mechanistic pathway which proceeds through non-reversible hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) from a cobalt hydride species which is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins due to a much higher relative barrier associated with olefin HAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;Substituted Diamide and Its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic characteristics of the kinetic state in supramolecular polymerization must be thoroughly understood to advance the design and synthesis of functional soft materials. This molecular dynamics study provides the same, along with new insights into the monomeric and thermodynamic states, thus addressing the origin of the lag phase. It also describes the minimum free&#8208;energy path from the kinetic to the thermodynamic states.







Abstract
The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule's torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8211;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones only. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.

         <title>Conception and Evaluation of a Library of Cleavable Mass Tags for Digital Polymers Sequencing</title>

         <dc:description>
An optimal set of phosphoramidite monomers was synthesized herein for facilitating the mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of digital poly(phosphodiester)s. These molecules contain a cleavable alkoxyamine group and various side&#8208;chain substituents with a distinct mass signature. When incorporated periodically in the polymers, these new molecules enable a controlled MS fragmentation and an easy identification of the resulting fragments.







Abstract
A library of phosphoramidite monomers containing a main&#8208;chain cleavable alkoxyamine and a side&#8208;chain substituent of variable molar mass (i.e. mass tag) was prepared in this work. These monomers can be used in automated solid&#8208;phase phosphoramidite chemistry and therefore incorporated periodically as spacers inside digitally&#8208;encoded poly(phosphodiester) chains. Consequently, the formed polymers contain tagged cleavable sites that guide their fragmentation in mass spectrometry sequencing and enhance their digital readability. The spacers were all prepared via a seven steps synthetic procedure. They were afterwards tested for the synthesis and sequencing of model digital polymers. Uniform digitally&#8208;encoded polymers were obtained as major species in all cases, even though some minor defects were sometimes detected. Furthermore, the polymers were decoded in pseudo&#8208;MS3 conditions, thus confirming the reliability and versatility of the spacers library.

         <title>Integrated Tandem Electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical Coupling of Biomass and Nitrate to Sustainable Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical strategy, the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic and waste nitrate were coupled into an amino acid, alanine. In detail, NO3&#8722; was electro&#8208;reduced to NH2OH, which could interact with PA to the form pyruvic oxime, and then the pyruvic oxime was electro&#8208;reduced to the desired alanine.







Abstract
Alanine is widely employed for synthesizing polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Electrocatalytic coupling of biomass molecules and waste nitrate is attractive for the nitrate removal and alanine production under ambient conditions. However, the reaction efficiency is relatively low due to the activation of the stable substrates, and the coupling of two reactive intermediates remains challenging. Herein, we realize the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electochemical synthesis of alanine from the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic acid (PA) and waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) catalyzed by PdCu nano&#8208;bead&#8208;wires (PdCu NBWs). The overall reaction pathway is demonstrated as a multiple&#8208;step catalytic cascade process via coupling the reactive intermediates NH2OH and PA on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, in this integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical catalytic cascade process, Cu facilitates the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to NH2OH intermediates, which chemically couple with PA to form the pyruvic oxime, and Pd promotes the electrochemical reduction of pyruvic oxime to the desirable alanine. This work provides a green strategy to convert waste NO3&#8722; to wealth and enriches the substrate scope of renewable biomass feedstocks to produce high&#8208;value amino acids.

         <title>A Bismuth&#8208;Based Zeolitic Organic Framework with Coordination&#8208;Linked Metal Cages for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;directing strategy is developed to build a bismuth&#8208;based zeolitic organic framework (Bi&#8208;ZMOFs) with coordination&#8208;linked metal cages for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH with 91&#8201;% efficiency. The coordination of Bi with pyrazole&#8208;N atom triggers an effective interatomic electron transfer and contributes to the activation of CO2 and stabilization of the active intermediates.







Abstract
Zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) have emerged as one of the most promsing catalysts for energy conversion, but they suffer from either weak bonding between metal&#8208;organic cubes (MOCs) that decrease their stability during catalysis processes or low activity due to inadequate active sites. In this work, through ligand&#8208;directing strategy, we successfully obtain an unprecedented bismuth&#8208;based ZMOF (Bi&#8208;ZMOF) featuring a ACO topological crystal structure with strong coordination bonding between the Bi&#8208;based cages. As a result, it enables efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) with Faradaic efficiency as high as 91&#8201;%. A combination of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals that the Bi&#8722;N coordination contributes to facilitating charge transfer from N to Bi atoms, which stabilize the intermediate to boost the reduction efficiency of CO2 to HCOOH. This finding highlights the importance of the coordination environment of metal active sites on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that this work will offer a new clue to rationally design zeolitic MOFs for catalytic reaction

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2S3 nanocrystals constitute a novel type of quantum dots exempt from toxic heavy metals whose fluorescence can be tuned from broad trap&#8208;state to narrow band&#8208;edge emission in the deep blue range by coating their surface with a ZnS shell. An additional alumina shell enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield close to 50&#8201;% while maintaining a short lifetime around 1&#8197;ns.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide band gap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3/ZnS/Al2O3. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect&#8208;mediated states leading to efficient deep&#8208;blue emission at 400&#8197;nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the PL quantum yield approaching 50&#8201;% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

A cyano hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework has been applied to a Li&#8208;CO2 battery for the first time. The HOF endows Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1800&#8197;h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96&#8197;V even at high current densities up to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel protic acyclic carbene&#8208;AuI enantiomers exhibited solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from crystals to helices driven by synergetic aurophilicity and H&#8208;bonds. Three polymorphs showed intense thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high quantum yield (&#934;FL). Extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains in helices amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with boosted luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) and CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds. Their aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95&#8201;% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au dimers with &#960;&#8208;stacking or one&#8208;dimensional extended Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains. Via drop&#8208;casting method, supramolecular P&#8208; or M&#8208;helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum|=0.030, &#934;FL=67&#8201;%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10&#8722;3. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading Pd NCs on the Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2, we were able to promote the proton deintercalation process on the catalyst surface as well as HMF adsorption, respectively. As a result, a comprehensive optimization in performance by simultaneously decreasing the onset potential of the reaction and enhancing the current density can be achieved.







Abstract
The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96&#8197;nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32&#8197;V and achieved a current density of 50&#8197;mA/cm2 at only 1.38&#8197;V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8722;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8722;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8722;O.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cryolite material (Cs2NaHoCl6) has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence. Further, its luminescence efficiency can be effectively improved and the emission was tailored through alloying Sb3+ ions (s&#8208;p energy levels) and Yb3+ ions (f&#8208;f energy levels). These findings highlight the immense potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s&#8208;p transitions) and Yb3+ (f&#8208;f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334&#8197;nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980&#8197;nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti&#8208;thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+ doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+ in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four ribbon&#8208;like bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules were synthesized by intermolecular or intramolecular radical&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. They show electronic structures resembling the typical pyrenacenes rather than quinoidal rylenes, with localized aromatic benzenoid rings along the central long axis.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of In&#8208;Situ Hybrid Interface Construction and pH Buffering Enabled Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode at High Current Density and Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation concept is developed by introducing taurine into electrolyte. In addition to buffering the pH of the electrolyte, the preferentially adsorbed taurine on the Zn surface reconstructs the electronic double layer (EDL) and subsequently builds an in situ hybrid interface to inhibit side reactions and regulate Zn deposition. This synergistic modulation strategy greatly enhances the performance of Zn anode and full batteries.







Abstract
In aqueous electrolytes, the uncontrollable interfacial evolution caused by a series of factors such as pH variation and unregulated Zn2+ diffusion would usually result in the rapid failure of metallic Zn anode. Considering the high correlation among various triggers that induce the anode deterioration, a synergistic modulation strategy based on electrolyte modification is developed. Benefitting from the unique pH buffer mechanism of the electrolyte additive and its capability to in situ construct a zincophilic solid interface, this synergistic effect can comprehensively manage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of Zn anode by inhibiting the pH variation and parasitic side reactions, accelerating de&#8208;solvation of hydrated Zn2+, and regulating the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ to realize uniform Zn deposition. Thus, the modified Zn anode can achieve an impressive lifespan at ultra&#8208;high current density and areal capacity, operating stably for 609 and 209&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Based on this exceptional performance, high loading Zn||NH4V4O10 batteries can achieve excellent cycle stability and rate performance. Compared with those previously reported single pH buffer strategies, the synergistic modulation concept is expected to provide a new approach for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

Utilized sulfonic acid&#8208;modified COFs (TCOF&#8208;S) photo&#8208;catalyst to generate free radicals to trigger the rapid in situ light solidification of acrylamide in the pore channels of COFs. Formed TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel has combined polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) with single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) and make them complement each other.







Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2&#8197;mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248&#8197;mAh/g at 1C), excellent rate capability (90&#8197;mAh/g at 10C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large&#8208;scaled flexible high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF-S-Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large-scaled flexible high-performance quasi-solid-state zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of converting NO into pyridine oximes utilizing in situ generated NH2OH for organophpsphorus poisoning is realized by electrocatalysis over Al coordinated on nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance to synthesize medicine and multidisciplinary science, providing new insights for constructing new efficient system for NH2OH production and utilization.







Abstract
Pyridine oximes produced from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8&#8201;% and a yield of 92.1&#8201;%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8722;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.

         <title>Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyze CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

Organic poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT) polymer dots were applied as the CO2 photoreduction catalyst in aqueous solution to yield a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% and promising stability. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoexcited PFBT was reduced by triethanolamine (TEOA) first, then bound with CO2 before CO production.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable fuels is desirable to realize a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we report that polymer dots (Pdots) of poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT), without adding any extra co&#8208;catalyst, can photocatalyze reduction of CO2 into CO in aqueous solution, rendering a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a detectable selectivity of up to 100&#8201;%. After 5 cycles of CO2 re&#8208;purging experiments, no distinct decline in CO amount and reaction rate was observed, indicating the promising photocatalytic stability of PFBT Pdots in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. A mechanistic study reveals that photoexcited PFBT Pdots are reduced by sacrificial donor first, then the reduced PFBT Pdots can bind CO2 and reduce it into CO via their intrinsic active sites. This work highlights the application of organic Pdots for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution, which therefore provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly nanoparticulate photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclization in Eunicellane Derived Diterpenoid Biosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three highly oxidized eunicellane&#8208;derived 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C, were discovered through genome mining. In vivo and in vitro investigations and quantum chemical computations systematically established that terpene cyclase (TC) and P450 enzymes work in tandem to create the backbone of aridacins, representing an unprecedented strategy in terpene skeletal construction.







Abstract
Terpene cyclization, one of the most complex chemical reactions in nature, is generally catalyzed by two classes of terpene cyclases (TCs). Cytochrome P450s that act as unexpected TC&#8208;like enzymes are known but are very rare. In this study, we genome&#8208;mined a cryptic bacterial terpenoid gene cluster, named ari, from the thermophilic actinomycete strain Amycolatopsis arida. By employing a heterologous production system, we isolated and characterized three highly oxidized eunicellane derived diterpenoids, aridacins A&#8722;C (1&#8211;3), that possess a 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold. In vivo and in vitro experiments systematically established a noncanonical two&#8208;step biosynthetic pathway for diterpene skeleton formation. First, a class I TC (AriE) cyclizes geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) into a 6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic cis&#8208;eunicellane skeleton. Next, a cytochrome P450 (AriF) catalyzes cyclization of the eunicellane skeleton into the 6/7/5&#8208;fused tricyclic scaffold through C2&#8722;C6 bond formation. Based on the results of quantum chemical computations, hydrogen abstraction followed by electron transfer coupled to barrierless carbocation ring closure is shown to be a viable mechanism for AriF&#8208;mediated cyclization. The biosynthetic logic of skeleton construction in the aridacins is unprecedented, expanding the catalytic capacity and diversity of P450s and setting the stage to investigate the inherent principles of carbocation generation by P450s in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.

         <title>A Photolabile Curcumin&#8208;Diazirine Analogue Enables Phototherapy with Physically and Molecularly Produced Light for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment
</title>

         <dc:description>
A photolabile curcumin analogue CRANAD&#8208;147 is reported. It could lead to changes in properties, structures (sequences) and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species in vitro and in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo with molecularly generated light (dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;) from chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. It has great potential as an alternative approach for AD drug discovery.







Abstract
The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs has recently witnessed substantial achievement. To further enhance the pool of drug candidates, it is crucial to explore non&#8208;traditional therapeutic avenues. In this study, we present the use of a photolabile curcumin&#8208;diazirine analogue, CRANAD&#8208;147, to induce changes in properties, structures (sequences), and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species both in cells and in vivo. This manipulation was achieved through irradiation with LED light or molecularly generated light, dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, emitted by the chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD&#8208;147/LED or CRANAD&#8208;147/ADLumin&#8208;4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.

Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD-147/LED or CRANAD-147/ADLumin-4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient hydrogenative PET degradation protocol was developed under mild conditions enabled by a novel transesterification/hydrogenation relay strategy and rationally designed catalysts. A broad range of post&#8208;consumer PET sources and other types of polyesters were easily degraded in excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the evolution of catalyst and the important role of methanol for promoting the reaction efficiency.







Abstract
The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar H2. The key to the success of this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Enhanced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Polymer Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disorder is usually considered to cause photoluminescence quenching by dissipating excited&#8208;state energy, here we challenge the conventional wisdom by showing that increased disorder from crystalline to polymer media actually enhances room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, when a mediating charge&#8208;transfer state is involved.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have important applications for biological imaging, oxygen sensing, data encryption, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the many advantages polymeric materials offer such as great control over gas permeability and processing flexibility, disorder is traditionally considered as an intrinsic negative impact on the efficiency for embedded RTP luminophores, as various allowed thermal motions could quench the emitting states. However, we propose that such disorder&#8208;enabled freedoms of microscopic motions can be beneficial for charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated RTP, which is facilitated by molecular conformational changes among different electronic transition states. Using the &#8220;classic&#8221; pyrene&#8208;aniline exciplex as an example, we demonstrate the mutual enhancement of red/near&#8208;infrared and green RTP emissions from the pyrene and aniline moieties, respectively, upon doping the aniline polymer with trace pyrene derivatives. In comparison, a pyrene&#8208;doped crystal formed with the same aniline structure exhibits only charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence with no red or green RTP observed, suggesting that order suppresses the RTP channels. The proposed polymerization strategy may be used as a unified method to generate multi&#8208;emissive polymeric RTP materials from a vast pool of known and unknown exciplexes and charge&#8208;transfer complexes.

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

The photogenerated radicals effectively inhibit metal atom aggregation and facilitate their cooperative anchoring with nitrogen species and lattice oxygen on the support, thereby enabling precise synthesis of Single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We streamline the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms by sequentially generating two heteroatom metal carbenes using a designer I(III)/S(VI) reagent. This strategy enables the selective addition of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or carbon atoms, incorporating up to three functional groups at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyls in a single step.







Abstract
Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8722;H bond (where X=O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8722;H bond. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;S double insertion, and C&#8722;S/Y&#8722;H double insertion (where Y=S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, economical, and direct approach to access &#945;,&#946;&#8208;deuterated styrene compounds via triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;mediated electrochemical deuteration of styrenes and derivatives through electrochemical deuterium atom transfer (eDAT) has been developed. This approach tolerated a wide range of styrenes and 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes, and the extension to late stage deuteration of complex molecules and their derivatives showed a potential prospect.







Abstract
Despite widespread use of the deuterium isotope effect, selective deuterium labeling of chemical molecules remains a major challenge. Herein, a facile and general electrochemically driven, organic mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes with deuterium oxide (D2O) as the economical deuterium source was reported. Importantly, this transformation could be suitable for various electron rich styrenes mediated by triphenylphosphine (TPP). The reaction proceeded under mild conditions without transition&#8208;metal catalysts, affording the desired products in good yields with excellent D&#8208;incorporation (D&#8208;inc, up to &gt;99&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations by means of isotope labeling experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests provided sufficient support for this transformation. Notably, this method proved to be a powerful tool for late&#8208;stage deuteration of biorelevant compounds.

         <title>Decorating Channel Walls in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Crown Ethers for Efficient and Selective Separation of Radioactive Strontium(II)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF adsorbent is fabricated for the removal of radioactive strontium(II) from nuclear wastewater. Benefiting from the synergy of the 1D channels for efficient transportation of Sr2+ ions and the decorating of the functional sites on the channel walls to aviod the blocking of the channels, the MOF adsorbent realizes highly efficient and ultrafast separation of strontium(II).







Abstract
Nuclear accidents and the improper disposal of nuclear wastes have led to serious environmental radioactive pollutions. The rational design of adsorbents for the highly efficient separation of strontium(II) is essential in treating nuclear waste and recovering radioactive strontium resources. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential materials for the separation of aqueous metal ions owing to their designable structure and tunable functionality. Herein, a novel 3D MOF material MOF&#8208;18Cr6, in which 1D channels are formed using 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether&#8208;containing ligands as channel walls, is fabricated for strontium(II) separation. In contrast to traditional MOFs designed by grafting functional groups in the framework pores, MOF&#8208;18Cr6 possesses regular 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether cavities on the channel walls, which not only can transport and intake strontium(II) via the channels, but also prevent blockage of the channels after the binding of strontium(II). Consequently, the functional sites are fully utilized to achieve a high strontium(II) removal rate of 99.73&#8201;% in simulated nuclear wastewater. This study fabricates a highly promising adsorbent for the separation of aqueous radioactive strontium(II), and more importantly, can provide a new strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF adsorbents for separating target substances from complex aqueous environments.

         <title>Direct Assembly of Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;phenolic network nanoparticles (MPN NPs) with different compositions are directly assembled, without templates or seeding agents, by controlling the coordination kinetics of metal&#8208;phenolic complexes. The strong binding affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules enables the incorporation of functional cargos (e.g., proteins and drugs) to form cargo&#8208;loaded MPN NPs for potential biomedical applications.







Abstract
Coordination assembly offers a versatile means to developing advanced materials for various applications. However, current strategies for assembling metal&#8208;organic networks into nanoparticles (NPs) often face challenges such as the use of toxic organic solvents, cytotoxicity because of synthetic organic ligands, and complex synthesis procedures. Herein, we directly assemble metal&#8208;organic networks into NPs using metal ions and polyphenols (i.e., metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs)) in aqueous solutions without templating or seeding agents. We demonstrate the role of buffers (e.g., phosphate buffer) in governing NP formation and the engineering of the NP physicochemical properties (e.g., tunable sizes from 50 to 270&#8197;nm) by altering the assembly conditions. A library of MPN NPs is prepared using natural polyphenols and various metal ions. Diverse functional cargos, including anticancer drugs and proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points, are readily loaded within the NPs for various applications (e.g., biocatalysis, therapeutic delivery) by direct mixing, without surface modification, owing to the strong affinity of polyphenols to various guest molecules. This study provides insights into the assembly mechanism of metal&#8208;organic complexes into NPs and offers a simple strategy to engineer nanosized materials with desired properties for diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. The unique binary stacking modes of the [Cu2Br(IN)2]n nanosheets offers a chance to understand the relationship between nanosheet stacking behaviors and the gas separation performance of the resulting membranes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN=isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt;290 with H2 permeance &gt;520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt;190 with H2 permeance &gt;590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.

         <title>Synthetic Membraneless Droplets for Synaptic&#8208;Like Clustering of Lipid Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new aqueous droplet as mimic of membraneless organelles (MLOs), which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets, apart from the widely known complex coacervates and neutral polymer&#8208;based aqueous two&#8208;phase systems. The SA droplet exhibits MLO&#8208;mimicking complex phase behaviors and can cluster charged lipid vesicles like MLOs at synapse, which has been hitherto unachievable for most current MLO&#8208;mimics.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, the membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) are found to interact intimately with membranous organelles (MOs). One major mode is the clustering of MOs by MLOs, such as the formation of clusters of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals mediated by the synapsin&#8208;rich MLOs. Aqueous droplets, including complex coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems, have been plausible MLO&#8208;mimics to emulate or elucidate biological processes. However, neither of them can cluster lipid vesicles (LVs) like MLOs. In this work, we develop a synthetic droplet assembled from a combination of two different interactions underlying the formation of these two droplets, namely, associative and segregative interactions, which we call segregative&#8208;associative (SA) droplets. The SA droplets cluster and disperse LVs recapitulating the key functional features of synapsin condensates, which can be attributed to the weak electrostatic interaction environment provided by SA droplets. This work suggests LLPS with combined segregative and associative interactions as a possible route for synaptic clustering of lipid vesicles and highlights SA droplets as plausible MLO&#8208;mimics and models for studying and mimicking related cellular dynamics.

The SA droplets cluster and disperse LVs recapitulating the key functional features of synapsin condensates, which can be attributed to the weak electrostatic interaction environment provided by SA droplets. This work suggests LLPS with combined segregative and associative interactions as a possible route for synaptic clustering of lipid vesicles and highlights SA droplets as plausible MLO-mimics and models for studying and mimicking related cellular dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Fluorine Groups in Passivating Defects for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In passivating perovskite defects it is shown that the F group can interact with the passivation groups of the additives, leading to different abilities to passivate defects rather than only introducing additional interactions between F and Pb2+ as previously thought. The efficiencies of perovskite solar cells and modules made with the fluorinated passivators reach 24.70&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.13&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2), respectively, with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Introducing fluorine (F) groups into a passivator plays an important role in enhancing the defect passivation effect for the perovskite film, which is usually attributed to the direct interaction of F and defect states. However, the interaction between electronegative F and electron&#8208;rich passivation groups in the same molecule, which may influence the passivation effect, is ignored. We herein report that such interactions can vary the electron cloud distribution around the passivation groups and thus changing their coordination with defect sites. By comparing two fluorinated molecules, heptafluorobutylamine (HFBM) and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), we find that the F/&#8722;NH2 interaction in HFBM is stronger than the F/&#8722;COOH one in HFBA, inducing weaker passivation ability of HFBM than HFBA. Accordingly, HFBA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) provide an efficiency of 24.70&#8201;% with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area perovskite module (14.0&#8197;cm2) based on HFBA reaches 21.13&#8201;%. Our work offers an insight into understanding an unaware role of the F group in impacting the passivation effect for the perovskite film.

         <title>Functional Polythioamides Derived from Thiocarbonyl Fluoride
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polythioamides have been successfully synthesized using diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. These polythioamides exhibit inherent selectivity in coordinating metal ions, resulting in the formation of PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles that can serve as recyclable homogeneous catalysts. This study highlights the potential of thiocarbonyl fluoride as a powerful hub for addressing the challenging synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polythioamide is a unique type of sulfur&#8208;containing polymer with advanced functionalities. Nonetheless, the elemental sulfur commonly used in their synthesis tends to react readily with unsaturated functional groups, thereby limiting the scope of eligible substrates. Inspired by the highly efficient sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) polymerization through discrete hubs, we present herein a pioneering and versatile approach to the synthesis of polythioamides from diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub. Well&#8208;defined structures, including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were realized. These newly devised polythioamides can efficiently and selectively bind to metal ions and were applied in precious&#8208;metal recovery. Further development resulted in PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles serving as recyclable homogeneous catalysts, thus demonstrating the vast potential of these unprecedented polythioamides. We anticipate that thiocarbonyl fluoride could emerge as a potent hub for facilitating the intricate synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.

Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202307086), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With the Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

         <title>Back Cover: On the Conformation of Dimeric Acceptors and Their Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18&#8201;% (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 45/2023)</title>

Two dimeric acceptors , DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S were synthesized by linking two Y6&#8208;derivative segments using different central linking bridges: selenophene and thiophene. Both adopt a favorable O&#8208;shape conformation as confirmed by simulations and 2D NMR spectroscopy. Paired with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer donor PM6, optimized solar cells employing DIBP3F&#8208;Se showcase remarkable performance with a power conversion efficiency of 18.09&#8201;%, as demonstrated by Donghong Yu, Thomas&#8197;D. Anthopoulos, Ergang Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302888).

Mn2+&#160; is a so&#8208;far still rather underestimated visible emitter that is more abundant than the currently dominantly used emitter Eu2+. This could be a possible alternative for future LED phosphors. The cover picture shows octahedrally coordinated Mn2+&#160;ions embedded in the borosulfate Zn[B2(SO4)4]. Borosulfates are weakly coordinating ligands, which is directly reflected in the photoluminescence properties of the Mn2+ ions: They show orange narrow emission, which is indicative for a weak octahedral ligand field, as explained by J&#246;rn Bruns, Markus Suta et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309212).

         <title>Preparative Scale Applications of C&#8722;H Activation in Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers examples where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale for the synthesis of drugs/drug candidates. Key features of the optimization process, challenges and potential of such methods in the pharmaceutical industry are discussed for various metals and transformations.







Abstract
C&#8722;H activation is an attractive methodology to increase molecular complexity without requiring substrate prefunctionalization. In contrast to well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling methods, C&#8722;H activation is less explored on large scales and its use in the production of pharmaceuticals faces substantial hurdles. However, the inherent advantages, such as shorter synthetic routes and simpler starting materials, motivate medicinal chemists and process chemists to overcome these challenges, and exploit C&#8722;H activation steps for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In this review, we will cover examples of drugs/drug candidates where C&#8722;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale (range between 355&#8197;mg and 130&#8197;kg). The optimization processes will be described, and each example will be examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, providing the reader with an in&#8208;depth understanding of the challenges and potential of C&#8722;H activation methodologies in the production of pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling (eXEC) Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) has emerged as a practical, green, sustainable, efficient electrochemical and controllable approach for constructing C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bonds through selective cross&#8208;coupling of different electrophiles. This Mini&#8208;review summarizes the recent protocols of electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry utilizes electrons as a potent, controllable, and traceless alternative to chemical oxidants or reductants, and typically offers a more sustainable option for achieving selective organic synthesis. Recently, the merger of electrochemistry with readily available electrophiles has been recognized as a viable and increasingly popular methodology for efficiently constructing challenging C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds in a sustainable manner for complex organic molecules. In this mini&#8208;review, we have systematically summarized the most recent advances in electroreductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (eXEC) reactions during the last decade. Our focus has been on readily available electrophiles, including aryl and alkyl organic (pseudo)halides, as well as small molecules such as CO2, SO2, and D2O.

         <title>P&#8208;type Polymers in Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics combine the functions of photovoltaic conversion and visual semitransparency. The p&#8208;type polymers used in semitransparent organic photovoltaics are systematically summarized from the perspectives of chemical structures, conformation structures, and aggregation structures. The design guidelines for novel p&#8208;type polymers in high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics are also proposed.







Abstract
P&#8208;type polymers are polymeric semiconducting materials that conduct holes and have extensive applications in optoelectronics such as organic photovoltaics. Taking the advantage of intrinsic discontinuous light absorption of organic semiconductors, semitransparent organic photovoltaics (STOPVs) present compelling opportunities in various potential applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics, automobiles, and wearable electronics. The characteristics of p&#8208;type polymers, including optical, electronic, and morphological properties, determine the performance of STOPVs, and the requirements for p&#8208;type polymers differ between opaque organic photovoltaics and STOPVs. Hence, in this Minireview, recent advances of p&#8208;type polymers used in STOPVs are systematically summarized, with emphasis on the effects of chemical structures, conformation structures, and aggregation structures of p&#8208;type polymers on the performance of STOPVs. Furthermore, new design concepts and guidelines are also proposed for p&#8208;type polymers to facilitate the future development of high&#8208;performance STOPVs.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is the most crucial issue hindering the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. This review concentrates on the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites from the chemical mechanism, detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level, and especially intrinsic causes/extrinsic causes to provide clear guidelines to accurately suppress the oxidation.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14&#8201;%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of an in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.

         <title>Fluorogenic and Cell&#8208;Permeable Rhodamine Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Live&#8208;Cell Protein Labeling in Bioimaging and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the equilibrium between a nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion state (protein&#8208;bound), fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamine dyes have been developed for high&#8208;contrast protein labeling in living cells. Such new generation of probes offer exceptional performance in multi&#8208;color/lifetime imaging, superresolution microscopy, single protein tracking, and chemigenetic biosensors.







Abstract
The advancement of fluorescence microscopy techniques has opened up new opportunities for visualizing proteins and unraveling their functions in living biological systems. Small&#8208;molecule organic dyes, which possess exceptional photophysical properties, small size, and high photostability, serve as powerful fluorescent reporters in protein imaging. However, achieving high&#8208;contrast live&#8208;cell labeling of target proteins with conventional organic dyes remains a considerable challenge in bioimaging and biosensing due to their inadequate cell permeability and high background signal. Over the past decade, a novel generation of fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable dyes has been developed, which have substantially improved live&#8208;cell protein labeling by fine&#8208;tuning the reversible equilibrium between a cell&#8208;permeable, nonfluorescent spirocyclic state (unbound) and a fluorescent zwitterion (protein&#8208;bound) of rhodamines. In this review, we present the mechanism and design strategies of these fluorogenic and cell&#8208;permeable rhodamines, as well as their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Induced Polar Tri&#8208;layered Perovskite for Record&#8208;Performance Polarized Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lone&#8208;pair electron in MHy+ (methylhydrazine) results in the generation of a dipole moment. The dipole moments aggregate to give polarization, which is detected with a steady open&#8208;circuit voltage. Polarized detectors using the (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine) single&#8208;crystal have an ultrahigh polarization ratio of up to 24.6 in self&#8208;powered mode, this ratio is a record for organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite single&#8208;crystals.







Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect, a promising optoelectronic phenomenon for generating polarized dependent steady&#8208;state photocurrent, has been widely applied in various photodetectors. However, incorporating stereochemically active lone pair to construct bulk photovoltage in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) is still elusive and challenging. Herein, bulk photovoltage (1.2&#8197;V) has been successfully achieved by introducing the stereo&#8208;chemically active lone pair perovskitizer to construct a polar tri&#8208;layered hybrid perovskite, namely, (IBA)2MHy2Pb3Br10 (1, IBA=iso&#8208;butylamine, MHy=methylhydrazine). Strikingly, owning to the promising bulk photovoltage, 1&#8208;based detectors exhibit an ultra&#8208;highly sensitive polarized photodetection (polarization ratio of up to 24.6) under self&#8208;powered mode. This ratio surpasses all the reported two&#8208;dimension OIHP single&#8208;crystal photodetectors. In addition, detectors exhibit outstanding responsivity (&#8776;200&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (&#8776;2.4&#215;1013 Jones). More excitingly, further investigation confirms that lone pair electrons in MHy+ result in the separation of positive and negative charges to produce directional dipoles, which further directional alignment to generate bulk photovoltage, thereby resulting in polarization&#8208;dependent photocurrent. Our findings provide a new demonstration for polar multilayer materials&#8217; construction and may open opportunities for a host of high&#8208;sensitive polarized photodetection.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis with Gaseous Molecular Ions: Harvesting [B12Br11N2]&#8722; from a Mass Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion [B12Br11N2]&#8722; was previously only observed in mass spectra. Reactions of gaseous fragment ions and high current ion soft&#8208;landing were combined to synthesize this molecular ion and enable its analysis by NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as to explore follow&#8208;up reactions in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the products of ion&#8208;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass&#8208;selection and soft&#8208;landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.

&lt;p&gt;The ion [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was previously only observed in mass spectra. Reactions of gaseous fragment ions and high current ion soft-landing were combined to synthesize this molecular ion and enable its analysis by NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as to explore follow-up reactions in the condensed phase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that the products of ion-molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass-selection and soft-landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A building block assembling method allows a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites to be constructed. The resulting species have unprecedent gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors potentially boosting future non&#8208;volatile memory applications.







Abstract
Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n=1&#8211;5; HA=hexylamine and MA=methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n=&#8734;, Tc=239&#8197;K) to n=2 (Tc=310&#8197;K, &#916;T=71&#8197;K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent &#8776;19.74&#8197;&#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177;60&#8197;V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non&#8208;volatile memory devices.

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of strong aliphatic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is disclosed via an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with simple alkanes. The inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds are efficiently cleaved through intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer, providing an alternative organocatalytic approach for alkane C&#8722;H functionalization under transition metal&#8208; and light free conditions.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives increasing attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains scarce, especially when dealing with challenging C&#8722;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8722;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from alkynes through chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is demonstrated. This method also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones.

Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.

         <title>Divergent and Selective Light Alkene Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, a reductive Heck coupling, and a Heck/Kumada coupling of light alkenes are reported herein. These strategies enable highly efficient hydro&#8208;arylation/&#8208;vinylation, (di)arylation, vinylation, and aryl&#8208;vinylation transformations thus accessing alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. This coupling strategy provides a modular and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock light alkenes.







Abstract
Light olefins are abundantly manufactured in the petroleum industry and thus represent ideal starting materials for modern chemical synthesis. Selective and divergent transformations of feedstock light olefins to value&#8208;added chemicals are highly sought&#8208;after but remain challenging. Herein we report an exceptionally regioselective carbonickelation of light alkenes followed by in situ trapping with three types of nucleophiles, namely a reductant, base, or Grignard reagent. This protocol enables efficient 1,2&#8208;hydrofunctionalization, dicarbofunctionalization, and branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling of light alkenes with aryl and alkenyl reagents to streamline access to diverse alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. Harnessing bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands with acenaphthyl backbones for nickel catalysts is crucial to attain high reactivity and selectivity.

     alt="Divergent and Selective Light Alkene Cross-Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regioselective Ni-catalyzed Heck coupling, a reductive Heck coupling, and a Heck/Kumada coupling of light alkenes are reported herein. These strategies enable highly efficient hydro-arylation/-vinylation, (di)arylation, vinylation, and aryl-vinylation transformations thus accessing alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. This coupling strategy provides a modular and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock light alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light olefins are abundantly manufactured in the petroleum industry and thus represent ideal starting materials for modern chemical synthesis. Selective and divergent transformations of feedstock light olefins to value-added chemicals are highly sought-after but remain challenging. Herein we report an exceptionally regioselective carbonickelation of light alkenes followed by in situ trapping with three types of nucleophiles, namely a reductant, base, or Grignard reagent. This protocol enables efficient 1,2-hydrofunctionalization, dicarbofunctionalization, and branched-selective Heck-type cross-coupling of light alkenes with aryl and alkenyl reagents to streamline access to diverse alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. Harnessing bulky &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene ligands with acenaphthyl backbones for nickel catalysts is crucial to attain high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy provides a rare, modular, and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock alkenes and is expected to find broad applications in medicinal chemistry and industrial processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Forcing Twisted 1,7&#8208;Dibromoperylene Diimides to Flatten in the Solid State: What a Difference an Atom Makes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of CH2 or NH spacers of low stereochemical hindrance on the imide function of heavily twisted 1,7&#8208;dibromoperylene diimides (PDIs), enables, in the solid state, the unexpected flattening of the polyaromatic cores. Powder diffraction and DFT calculations provided reliable structural and energetic details and an estimate of stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of flat PDI cores, counterbalancing the natural tendency toward twisting.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDI) are workhorses in the field of organic electronics, owing to their appealing n&#8208;semiconducting properties. Optimization of their performances is widely pursued by bay&#8208;atom substitution and diverse imide functionalization. Bulk solids and thin&#8208;films of these species crystallize in a variety of stacking configurations, depending on the geometry of the stable conformation of the polyaromatic core. We here demonstrate that 1,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;substituted perylene diimides, PDI(H2Br2), possessing a heavily twisted conformation in the gas phase, in solution and in the solids, can be easily flattened in the solid state into centrosymmetric molecules if the polyaromatic cores form &#960;&#8211;&#960; stabilized chains. This is achieved by using axial residues with low stereochemical hindrance, as guaranteed by a single CH2/NH spacer directly linked to the imide function. Structural powder diffraction and DFT calculations on four newly designed species of the PDI(H2Br2) class coherently show that, thanks to the flexibility of the N&#8722;X&#8722;Ar link (X=CH2/NH), flat cores are indeed obtained by overcoming the interconversion barrier between twisted atropoisomers, of only 26.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This strategy may then be useful to induce &#8220;anomalously flat&#8221; polyaromatic cores of different kinds (substituted acenes/rylenes) in the solid state, towards suitable crystal packing and orbital interactions for improved electronic performances.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Polyethylene with In&#8208;Chain Photolyzable and Hydrolyzable Groups Enabling Recycling and Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain keto groups (keto&#8208;PE) yields mixed keto&#8208;ester&#8208;PE, which combines photodegradability of the in&#8208;chain ketones with the in&#8208;chain esters as chemical access point for solvolysis, while the basic materials properties of HDPE are fully retained.







Abstract
Polyethylenes endowed with low densities of in&#8208;chain hydrolyzable and photocleavable groups can improve their circularity and potentially reduce their environmental persistency. We show with model polymers derived from acyclic diene metathesis polymerization that the simultaneous presence of both groups has no adverse effect on the polyethylene crystal structure and thermal properties. Post&#8208;polymerization Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of keto&#8208;polyethylenes from non&#8208;alternating catalytic ethylene&#8208;CO chain growth copolymerization yield high molecular weight in&#8208;chain keto&#8208;ester polyethylenes (Mn&#8776;50.000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Oxidation can proceed without chain scission and consequently the desirable materials properties of HDPE are retained. At the same time we demonstrate the suitability of the in&#8208;chain ester groups for chemical recycling by methanolysis, and show that photolytic degradation by extended exposure to simulated sunlight occurs via the keto groups.

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#8722;Se/Te&#8722;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive thermochromism observed in dichalcogenide molecular crystals with no clear structural origin or associated phase transitions is found to be linked to the subtle changes in torsional vibrational modes around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds.







Abstract
We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100&#8197;K and 295&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism&#8212;especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Activation of Transesterification by Chemical Amplification in Dynamic Thiol&#8208;Ene Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of chemical amplification has been explored for the on&#8208;demand release of hydroxy groups in dynamic covalent thiol&#8208;ene photopolymers by controlled activation of a photoacid. In a domino effect fashion, a single photon event leads to a cascade of reactions, which ultimately endow the polymers with the ability to flow as a result of thermo&#8208;activated transesterification.







Abstract
Chemical amplification is a well&#8208;established concept in photoresist technology, wherein one photochemical event leads to a cascade of follow&#8208;up reactions that facilitate a controlled change in the solubility of a polymer. Herein, we transfer this concept to dynamic polymer networks to liberate both catalyst and functional groups required for bond exchange reactions under UV irradiation. For this, we exploit a photochemically generated acid to catalyse a deprotection reaction of an acid&#8208;labile tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl group, which is employed to mask the hydroxy groups of a vinyl monomer. At the same time, the released acid serves as a catalyst for thermo&#8208;activated transesterifications between the deprotected hydroxy and ester moieties. Introduced in an orthogonally cured (450&#8197;nm) thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, this approach allows for a spatio&#8208;temporally controlled activation of bond exchange reactions, which is crucial in light of the creep resistance versus reflow ability trade&#8208;off of dynamic polymer networks.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>

Diverse structural designs has led to the development of chalcone&#8208;flavylium systems that exhibit efficient switching across a wide spectrum of visible light, including long&#8208;wavelength red light in aqueous environments avoiding the typical UV&#8208;induced switches.







Abstract
The chalcone&#8208;flavylium photochromic system switches in aqueous media. However, the chalcone&#8594;flavylium conversion requires detrimental ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light for the switching which deters their applications in the biological domain. To address this issue, we have synthesized strategically modified chalcone scaffolds that can be reversibly switched to the flavylium forms with visible light ranging from 456&#8197;nm (blue) to 640&#8197;nm (red).

         <title>Ligand Modifications Produce Two&#8208;Step Magnetic Switching in a Cobalt(dioxolene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution and solid&#8208;state measurements provide support for the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. Employing a dynamic ligand scaffold may be the key to stabilizing the rare low spin Co(II) intermediate state and traversing both valence tautomeric and spin crossover transitions.







Abstract
Mononuclear monodioxolene valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complexes typically exist in their low spin (l.s.) CoIII(cat2&#8722;) and high spin (h.s.) CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) forms (cat2&#8722;=catecholato, and sq&#8901;&#8722;=seminquinonato forms of 3,5&#8722;di&#8722;tBu&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolene), which reversibly interconvert via temperature&#8208;dependent intramolecular electron transfer. Typically, the remaining four coordination sites on cobalt are supported by a tetradentate ligand whose properties influence the temperature at which VT occurs. We report that replacing one chelating pyridyl arm of tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (tpa) with a weaker field ortho&#8208;anisole moiety facilitates access to a third magnetic state, and examine a series of related complexes. Variable temperature crystallographic, magnetic, calorimetric, and spectroscopic studies support that this third state is consistent with l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;). Thus, our ligand modifications not only provide access to the VT transition from l.s. CoIII(cat2&#8722;) to l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), but at higher temperatures, the complex undergoes spin crossover from l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) to h.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), representing the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. We hypothesize that ligand dynamicity may facilitate access to the rarely observed l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) intermediate state, suggesting a new design criterion in the development of stimulus&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;state molecular switches.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradical was isolated without any kinetic blocking at the central m&#8208;phenylene bridge. An EPR study and quantum chemical calculations suggest the triplet state to be the ground state.







Abstract
A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, 108&#8197;years after Schlenk's m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as a diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Specific Silicon&#8208;Containing Conjugating Reagent: &#946;&#8208;Silyl Alkynyl Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of silicon&#8208;containing alkynone reagents that target free thiols to produce the stable vinyl&#8208;sulfide linker under biocompatible conditions is reported. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is also applicable to the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and pharmaceuticals with full retention of silicon handles in most cases.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules has been recognized as a versatile and powerful strategy for probing our biological systems and discovering novel therapeutics. The addition of lipophilic silicon moiety opens up new avenues for multi&#8208;disciplinary research with broad applications in both the medicinal and material sciences. However, adhering to the strict biocompatibility requirements, and achieving the introduction of labile silicon handle and high chemo&#8208;selectivity have been formidable. In this paper, we report silicon&#8208;based conjugating reagents including &#946;&#8208;trialkylsilyl and silyl ether&#8208;tethered alkynones that selectively react with thiols under physiological conditions. The pH&#8208;neutral, metal&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free reaction yields stable products with broad substrate compatibility and full retention of silicon handles in most cases. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is applicable in the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and payloads, thereby expanding the toolbox of thiol conjugation.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroenzymatic catalysis of the multisubunit complex formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase was investigated (left panel). The O2&#8208;sensitive enzyme isolated from a thermophilic methanogen reduces CO2 with high faradaic efficiency upon deposition on a graphite rod electrode (middle panel). The low affinity for formate (right panel) favoured its accumulation, an interesting property for CO2&#8208;conversion technologies.







Abstract
Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While a few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109&#177;1&#8201;%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.

The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive enzyme isolated from a thermophilic methanogen reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with high faradaic efficiency upon deposition on a graphite rod electrode (middle panel). The low affinity for formate (right panel) favoured its accumulation, an interesting property for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-conversion technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into higher-value products. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While a few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reducing-and-fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109&#177;1&#8201;%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zincophilic Interfacial Manipulation against Dendrite Growth and Side Reactions for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a multifunctional interphase layer to achieve highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer enables the homogenized Zn2+ flux, rapid desolvation kinetics, enhanced Zn2+ transference number, and suppressed side reactions, thus contributing to the high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced cycling performance with dendrite&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Constructing multifunctional interphases to suppress the rampant Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions is crucial for Zn anodes. Herein, a phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a versatile interphase layer to stabilize Zn anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer can manipulate Zn2+ flux and promote rapid desolvation kinetics, ensuring the uniform Zn deposition with dendrite&#8208;free morphology. Moreover, the robust PA&#8208;ZnAl protective layer can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of byproducts, further contributing to the reversible Zn plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, the Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650&#8197;h tested at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining three supramolecular sensing elements in a single solution forms an adaptive network of equilibrating sensors. Fingerprint sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte interactions results in emergent photophysical responses, allowing for the discrimination of highly similar challenging analytes.







Abstract
Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins and protein mixtures without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network's ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.

         <title>Photocatalytic Terminal C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction Inside Water Soluble Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for light&#8208;activated Glaser coupling in water is reported that uses visible light to trigger host&#8208;guest photoredox chemistry. Cage&#8208;confined neutral radicals drive the C&#8722;C coupling step through substrate preorganization.







Abstract
Developing methods that activate C&#8722;H bonds directly with high selectivity for C&#8722;C bond formation in complex organic synthesis has been a major chemistry challenge. Recently it has been shown that photoactivation of weakly polarized C&#8722;H bonds can be carried out inside a cationic water&#8208;soluble nanocage with visible light&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest charge transfer (CT) chemistry. Using this novel photoredox activation paradigm, here we demonstrate C&#8722;C bond formation to photo&#8208;generate 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature in water from terminal aromatic alkynes for the first time. The formation of cavity&#8208;confined alkyne radical cation and the proton&#8208;removed neutral radical species highlight the unique C&#8722;C coupling step driven by supramolecular preorganization.

         <title>Combination of Resonance and Non&#8208;Resonance Chiral Raman Scattering in a Cobalt(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman optical activity is becoming a useful tool to study geometry and electronic structure of molecules. For a cobalt complex we report large signal enhancement, unique resonance spectral pattern, and an advanced analysis based on vibrational functions of the ground and excited electronic state. For the first time, a dual circular polarization signal coming from asymmetric molecular polarizabilities was verified on enantiomers.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra with high sensitivity reveal details on molecular structure, chirality, and excited electronic properties. Despite the difficulty of the measurements, the recorded data for the Co(III) complex with S,S&#8208;N,N&#8208;ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid are of exceptional quality and, coupled with the theory, spectacularly document the molecular behavior in resonance. This includes a huge enhancement of the chiral scattering, contribution of the antisymmetric polarizabilities to the signal, and the Herzberg&#8208;Teller effect significantly shaping the spectra. The chiral component is by about one order of magnitude bigger than for an analogous aluminum complex. The band assignment and intensity profile were confirmed by simulations based on density functional and vibronic theories. The resonance was attributed to the S0&#8594;S3 transition, with the strongest signal enhancement of Raman and ROA spectral bands below about 800&#8197;cm&#8722;1. For higher wavenumbers, other excited electronic states contribute to the scattering in a less resonant way. RROA spectroscopy thus appears as a unique tool to study the structure and electronic states of absorbing molecules in analytical chemistry, biology, and material science.

Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has the potential to serve as a sustainable route to a wide variety of hydrocarbons, fuels and plastics in the quest for net zero. Synergistic Pd/In2O3 (Palldium on Indium Oxide) catalysts show high CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, enhancing methanol yield. The identity of the optimal active site for this reaction is unclear, either as a Pd&#8722;In alloy, proximate metals, or distinct sites. In this work, we demonstrate that metal&#8208;efficient Pd/In2O3 species dispersed on Al2O3 can match the performance of pure Pd/In2O3 systems. Further, we follow the evolution of both Pd and In sites, and surface species, under operando reaction conditions using X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscpy (XAS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In doing so, we can determine both the nature of the active sites and the influence on the catalytic mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; spectroscopy under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation conditions reveals the importance of catalyst design in a metal-efficient Palladium/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. Concurrent X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Pd and In, combined with infrared techniques reveals the roles of the two metals, relating them to the catalytic mechanism with vital insights for future multimetallic catalyst development.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Vinylindole Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylation of 1&#8208;Alkynylindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. A wide variety of vinylindole atropisomers were synthesized in excellent regioselectivity, stereoselectivity (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of unsymmetrical internal alkynes remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Moreover, the enantioselective hydroarylation of alkynes using organoboron reagents has not been reported. Herein, we report for the first time that palladium compounds can catalyze the hydroarylation of 1&#8208;alkynylindoles with organoborons for the synthesis of chiral C&#8722;N atropisomers. A series of rarely reported vinylindole atropisomers was synthesized with excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. The ready availability of organoborons and alkynes and the simplicity, high stereoselectivity, and good functional group tolerance of this catalytic system make it highly attractive.

         <title>Highly Uniform DNA Monolayers Generated by Freezing&#8208;Directed Assembly on Gold Surfaces Enable Robust Electrochemical Sensing in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing a droplet containing DNA on gold surfaces gives rise to a uniform DNA monolayer with vertically standing up and laterally separated conformations. Compared to DNA surfaces obtained by traditional methods, the freezing&#8208;induced surface is remarkably stable over electrochemical interrogation and long&#8208;term storage. The uniform conformation increases the binding affinity of DNA by over 40&#8208;fold and enhances the antifouling performance in undiluted whole blood.







Abstract
Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.

         <title>Temporal Regulation of PET&#8208;RAFT Controlled Radical Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 45, November 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise temporal control under visible irradiation has been achieved through a photocatalytic RAFT chemical recycling methodology. Depolymerization could be easily initiated by switching &#8220;on&#8221; the light, whereas negligible monomer regeneration was observed in the dark. This outstanding characteristic was possible by fine regulation of the deactivation of the depropagating chain and by finally suppressing thermal initiation of the chains.







Abstract
A photocatalytic RAFT&#8208;controlled radical depolymerization method is introduced for precisely conferring temporal control under visible light irradiation. By regulating the deactivation of the depropagating chains and suppressing thermal initiation, an excellent temporal control was enabled, exemplified by several consecutive &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; cycles. Minimal, if any, depolymerization could be observed during the dark periods while the polymer chain&#8208;ends could be efficiently re&#8208;activated and continue to depropagate upon re&#8208;exposure to light. Notably, favoring deactivation resulted in the gradual unzipping of polymer chains and a stepwise decrease in molecular weight over time. This synthetic approach constitutes a simple methodology to modulate temporal control during the chemical recycling of RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers while offering invaluable mechanistic insights.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Laboratory of Advanced Functional Materials (Tokoro Lab), Division of Materials Science, Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba (Japan); the Multifunctional Luminescent Materials Group (Szymon Group, MLMG), Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, Krak&#243;w (Poland); and the Solid State Physical Chemistry Group (Ohkoshi Lab), Department of Chemistry, School of Science, The University of Tokyo (Japan).

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts: Human&#8208; and AI&#8208;Driven Platform for Augmented Designs, Analytics and Reality&#8208;Enabled Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the opportunities offered by metal&#8211;organic frameworks for the selective gas&#8208;phase CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. Emphasis is provided to illustrate their flexibility in design and synthesis to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes, the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity to determine the activity and selectivity are also discussed.







Abstract
Large scale production of green CH3OH obtained from CO2 and green H2 is a highly wanted process due to the role of CH3OH as H2/energy carrier and for producing chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, particularly for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH that frequently ranges from 250 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. The existing literature in this area is briefly organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles (NPs). Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have also been highlighted.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Fluoroaroylation for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
An alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis is reported.

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre&#8208;functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted ketones. A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.

         <title>Evoking Ferroptosis by Synergistic Enhancement of a Cyclopentadienyl Iridium&#8208;Betulin Immune Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy was used to develop an immune agonist Ir&#8208;Bet composed of an iridium complex fused with the natural product Betulin, which induced ferritinophagy&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. The MLSE strategy not only promotes effective ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also provides a new mechanism of action for metal&#8208;based anticancer complexes for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with the potential for antitumor immunity activation. In this study, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal&#8208;based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir&#8208;Bet) was developed by a metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy involving the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2Cl2 with the natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir&#8208;Cp*) species as Ir&#8208;Bet not only tremendously enhanced the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activated ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evoked an immune response by nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation of Ir&#8208;Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurred by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. An in vivo vaccination experiment demonstrated desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects of Ir&#8208;Bet by increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/regulatory T cells (Tregs).

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst, which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional selectivity (96.0&#8201;%) and an impressive turnover frequency (2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1) in the reduction of O2 to water. These outstanding catalytic properties are attributed to the collaborative efforts of copper and iron, as they work together to efficiently break the O&#8722;O bond via the CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII intermediate.







Abstract
We report herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8722;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1 and selectivity of 96.0&#8201;% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 of CuCu&#8722;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9&#8201;%, and inactive of FeFe&#8722;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8722;O bond cleavage via a CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinating and electronic character. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.

         <title>Subrutilane&#8212;A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining uncovered a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus that produces the first known hexacyclic sesterterpene with no double bonds as the main product, as well as eight pentacyclic products. Isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations revealed a cyclisation cascade via several well&#8208;stabilised secondary cations. The enzyme also converted several substrate analogues into sesterterpenoid compounds.







Abstract
Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure, including the absolute configuration, was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogues (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with blocked reactivity at the C6&#8722;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogues were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.

         <title>Stereospecific Aminative Cyclizations Triggered by Intermolecular Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific opening by the pendant nucleophile.

The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides in good to high levels of enantiomeric excess was achieved using a chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst. Experimental results together with DFT calculations support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process, whose efficiency is impacted by developing steric interactions in the syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate complexes.







Abstract
Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters using distinct organometallic reagents has been developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that unique chelation patterns are essential in determining selectivity. This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated with coupling reactions through radical mechanisms, which commonly yield the classical products reacting through stable radical species.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8722;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.

&lt;p&gt;1,3-Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late-stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8722;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3-bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3-bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase was constructed by anchoring an editable organic cofactor to the proximal position of the heme center of P450BM3 as a co&#8208;catalytic center. This provides an unprecedented approach for assembling artificial metalloenzymes and substantially increases the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, as described by Longyi Jin, Zhiqi Cong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311259).

         <title>Accessing Ta/Cu Architectures via Metal&#8208;Metal Salt Metatheses: Heterobimetallic C&#8722;H Bond Activation Affords &#956;&#8208;Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;free metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis protocol facilitates heteromultimetallic complex formation. Bridging hydride ligands, originating from both an arene C&#8722;H activation event and H&#8208;atom transfer from solvent, stabilize unusual Cu&#8722;Ta bimetallics. These complexes are suitable platforms for subsequent metathesis chemistry, affording a tetranuclear complex featuring a highly reduced TaCu3 cluster.







Abstract
We employ a metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis strategy to access low&#8208;valent tantalum&#8208;copper heterometallic architectures (Ta&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu and Ta&#8722;&#956;3&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu3) that emulate structural elements proposed for surface alloyed nanomaterials. Whereas cluster assembly with carbonylmetalates is well precedented, the use of the corresponding polyarene transition metal anions is underexplored, despite recognition of these highly reactive fragments as storable sources of atomic Mn&#8722;. Our application of this strategy provides structurally unique early&#8208;late bimetallic species. These complexes incorporate bridging hydride ligands during their syntheses, the origin of which is elucidated via detailed isotopic labelling studies. Modification of ancillary ligand sterics and electronics alters the mechanism of bimetallic assembly; a trinuclear complex resulting from dinuclear C&#8722;H activation is demonstrated as an intermediate en route to formation of the bimetallic. Further validating the promise of this rational, bottom&#8208;up approach, a unique tetranuclear species was synthesized, featuring a Ta centre bearing three Ta&#8722;Cu interactions.

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of GX fluorophores have been designed and synthesized as activatable NIR&#8208;II PA dyes, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by CO was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as an activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Importantly, the GX dyes have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of GX dyes will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In general, two&#8208;component catalysts containing Lewis pairs are inferior to one&#8208;component ones due to the lack of intramolecular synergy. A silicon&#8208;centered bimolecular catalyst has been developed that exhibits a rare higher activity than its unimolecular analogue, even at low loadings. A unique two&#8208;path initiation mode was proposed to explain its exceptional catalytic performance in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide.







Abstract
This work reported that a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane/ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3&#8197;times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, and even 15.3&#8197;times the activity at an extremely low loading of 0.002&#8197;mol&#8201;%. By using 19F NMR spectroscopy, control experiments, and theoretical calculation we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity of the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity because of the increase in entropy.

         <title>Pushing Up the Size Limit of Boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;Acenes: Modular Synthesis and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA, B&#8208;[4,3]PA and B&#8208;[7,2]PA derivatives. This study not only enriches the scope of the [n,m]PA family but also provides a straightforward strategy of boron incorporation into zigzag edges of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which also enables precise modification of their physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) have recently attracted considerable attention considering their fascinating physical properties and chemical stability. However, the precise sole addition of boron atoms along the zigzag edges of PAs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited synthetic approach. Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped PAs (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA (1&#8201;a&#8208;2), B&#8208;[4,3]PA (1&#8201;b&#8208;2) and B&#8208;[7,2]PA (1&#8201;c&#8208;3) derivatives, through efficient intramolecular electrophilic borylation. Their chemical structures are unequivocally confirmed with a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, 1&#8201;b&#8208;2 exhibits an almost planar geometry, whereas 1&#8201;a&#8208;2 displays a distinctive bowl&#8208;like distortion. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of this series of B&#8208;PAs are thoroughly investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DFT calculation. Compared with their parent all&#8208;carbon analogs, the obtained B&#8208;PAs exhibit high stability, wide energy gaps, and high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 84&#8201;%. This study reveals the exceptional ability of boron doping to finely tune the physicochemical properties of PAs, showcasing their potential applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of oxidosqualene cyclase from Tripterygium wilfordii (TwOSC) was determined. This enzyme promotes a multistep cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade reaction to generate diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid skeletons. QM/MM simulations were performed and key residues identified to reveal the CSR mechanism. Semirational design of TwOSC was then carried out to promote friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to form diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade rearrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed at C2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C3 to yield a friedelin cation, which is finally deprotonated. However, as crystal structure data of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions occur in friedelin biosynthesis, as does the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton formation. Furthermore, we semirationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Homoleptic Diphosphene Lead Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic diphosphene lead complex was synthesized through controllable degradation of P4 by a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized plumbylone which possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions. The diphosphene lead complex exhibits intriguing reactivity involving the delivery of Pb(0) to perform redox reaction with iminoquinone thus producing a cyclic plumbylene and undergoing a NHC&#8208;induced two&#8208;step phosphorus cation abstraction reaction.







Abstract
Due to their limited capacity for &#960;&#8208;backdonation, isolation of &#960;&#8208;complexes of main&#8208;group elements remains a great challenge. We report herein the synthesis of a homoleptic diphosphene lead complex (2) from the degradation of P4 with a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized Pb(0) complex. Structural and computational studies showed that 2 possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions between Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, which is reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal diphosphene complexes. Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex 2 can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (4) and perform 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene (IMe2Me2) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP3 complex (6).

         <title>Encapsulation of Palladium Carbide Subnanometric Species in Zeolite Boosts Highly Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subnanometric Pd carbide species are encapsulated in MFI zeolite via a carbonization&#8208;reduction method. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The generated carbon species modulate both the Pd species and zeolite support, facilitating alkene desorption and thus leading to superior alkene selectivity.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a crucial step in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the widely utilized palladium (Pd)&#8208;based catalysts often suffer from poor selectivity. In this work, we demonstrate a carbonization&#8208;reduction method to create palladium carbide subnanometric species within pure silicate MFI zeolite. The carbon species can modify the electronic and steric characteristics of Pd species by forming the predominant Pd&#8722;C4 structure and, meanwhile, facilitate the desorption of alkenes by forming the Si&#8722;O&#8722;C structure with zeolite framework, as validated by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations and theoretical calculations. The developed catalyst shows superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), with 99&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at a complete conversion of phenylacetylene. In contrast, the zeolite&#8208;encapsulated carbon&#8208;free Pd catalyst and the commercial Lindlar catalyst show only 15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;% selectivity to styrene, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. The zeolite&#8208;confined Pd&#8208;carbide subnanoclusters promise their superior properties in semihydrogenation of alkynes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote&#8208;controlled manipulation of biological processes is meaningful but challenging. Herein we report the development of near infrared light photocatalytic decaging chemistry (CAT&#8208;NIR) for on&#8208;demand fluorescence activation and drug release in living cells. We also achieved protein rescue and in vivo prodrug activation by taking advantages of the decaging chemistry and the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of the NIR light.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a captivating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740&#8197;nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Remote-controlled manipulation of biological processes is meaningful but challenging. Herein we report the development of near infrared light photocatalytic decaging chemistry (CAT-NIR) for on-demand fluorescence activation and drug release in living cells. We also achieved protein rescue and in vivo prodrug activation by taking advantages of the decaging chemistry and the tissue-penetrating ability of the NIR light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote-controlled stimuli is a captivating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT-NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740&#8197;nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT-NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR-triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer-aided screening, CAT-NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue-penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote-controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT-NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Protein Conformation Transistor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful acquisition of &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structural protein nanocrystals that undergo ultrafast cross&#8208;linking behavior in response to pH levels above 7.6 illustrate the concept of a protein conformation proton transistor. This pH&#8208;responsive cross&#8208;linking can be conveniently achieved under near physiological conditions, highlighting the great potential in biomedicine, biosensing, and microfluidic chemistry.







Abstract
Analogous to electronic transistors, transistor&#8208;like responsive materials undergo sharp structural transitions in response to a very narrow range of microenvironment signals. This kind of material is typically limited to synthetic polymer&#8208;derived nanoscale assembly or disassembly and has profound implications for modern high&#8208;tech applications. Herein, we evolve this system from synthetic polymers to biopolymers and extend the corresponding assembly scale from the nanoscale to meso/macro&#8208;scale. We develop unique protein nanocrystals with core&#8211;shell structures through a two&#8208;step nucleation process. The protein nanocrystals exhibit exceptional transistor&#8208;like pH&#8208;responsive mesoscale assembly through the formation of inter&#8208;particle &#946;&#8208;sheet linkers. This allows ultrasensitive cross&#8208;linking behavior, such as self&#8208;coacervation at a water/water interface, ultrafast gelation in seconds, and ultrasensitive swelling for detection of basic vapors at extremely low concentrations. This breakthrough has great promise for broader applications such as drug encapsulation and delivery, biosensing, cytomimetic materials, and microfluidic chemistry.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular approach has been developed to inhibit the undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of cyanine dyes. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, the resulting supra&#8208;cyanines exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in both solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, and exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 50&#8201;%) in both solution and in the solid state. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination molecular recognition strategy is proposed to precisely regulate the local coordination structure of single&#8208;atom sites. Specifically, utilizing five&#8208;membered heterocycle molecules as the ligands, the coordination interaction between the guest&#8208;host molecules induces molecular recognition and ensures further precise settlement of the heteroatoms into the local coordination structure of the metal atoms in the single&#8208;atom sites.







Abstract
Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.

         <dc:description>
Discontinuously conjugated photocatalysts with electron trap are effective for natural light&#8208;induced bacteria inactivation. A low&#8208;toxicity photocatalyst with an electron&#8208;trap was actively assembled using by ethylenediamine and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride via a bottom&#8208;up acidification strategy. The obtained material (EDA&#8208;PTDA) exhibited a superior performance for photocatalytic antibacterial under natural light.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9&#8201;% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45&#8197;min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.

         <title>Guaiacol as an Organic Superoxide Dismutase Mimics for Anti&#8208;ageing a Ru&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guaiacol as an organic superoxide dismutase mimics scavenged superoxide radicals via disproportionation by chelating lithium superoxide on its two functional groups. Additionally, guaiacol formed homogeneously thin polymeric cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability. Resultantly, guaiacol successfully anti&#8208;aged lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich layered oxides using oxygen redox as well as transition metal redox suffer from its structural instability due to lattice oxygen escaped from its structure during oxygen redox and the following electrolyte decomposition by the reactive oxygen species. Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.

Herein, we rescued a Li-rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel amino&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts were obtained through SNAr with o&#8208;fluoro&#8208;diaryliodonium salts. A sequential arylation/ring opening pathway with external nucleophiles allows for transition metal&#8208;free skeletal diversification of cyclic amines to provide a wide variety of complex diarylamines with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. The strategy proved efficient also in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8722;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation is a sustainable tool for introducing important vicinal diol&#8208;related structures in alkenes. The scuba divers in the cover picture perform the highly efficient diacetoxylation of alkenes using renewable electricity as the driving force, as reported by Dirk De&#8197;Vos and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311539). Excellent yields are obtained with a wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes in an atom&#8208;efficient and versatile protocol, with also application to lactone synthesis.

         <title>Expanding the Range of Bioorthogonal Tags for Multiplex Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy with spectral phasor analysis enables the multiplex detection of bioorthogonal Raman groups in cells. Unmixing of the overlapping alkyne and deuterium signals together with the detection of metallacarboranes is reported within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum.







Abstract
Multiplex optical detection in live cells is challenging due to overlapping signals and poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise associated with some chemical reporters. To address this, the application of spectral phasor analysis to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for unmixing three bioorthogonal Raman probes within cells is reported. Triplex detection of a metallacarborane using the B&#8722;H stretch at 2480&#8211;2650&#8197;cm&#8722;1, together with a bis&#8208;alkyne and deuterated fatty acid can be achieved within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum. When coupled to imaging in the high&#8208;wavenumber region of the cellular Raman spectrum, nine discrete regions of interest can be spectrally unmixed from the hyperspectral SRS dataset, demonstrating a new capability in the toolkit of multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells.

         <dc:description>
The location of Pd nanoparticles relative to a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs, resulting in distinctly different product selectivity in the direct CO esterification. Moreover, the electronic state of Pd nanoparticles in Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X can be optimized by modulating Pd microenvironment with alterable X groups on the MOF linker toward improved activity, as reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311265).

The uncatalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of primary amines is made possible by a dual tunable plasma&#8208;microdroplet reaction platform utilizing the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;generation of reactive oxygen species during electrospray. Dual tunability is achieved by controlling the reagent concentration and timescale of reaction, allowing selective formation of single and double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are validated online via mass spectrometry and readily collected yielding milligram quantities in a preparative approach, as reported by Abraham&#8197;K.

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation Catalysis by Hydrogen Spillover on Platinum&#8208;Functionalized Heterogeneous Boronic Acid&#8208;Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular hydrogen is a key process in catalysis. Here, we demonstrate how polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based heterogeneous compounds functionalized with Platinum particles activate H2 by synergism between a hydrogen spillover mechanism and electron&#8208;proton transfer by the POM. This interplay facilitates the selective catalytic reduction of olefins and nitroarenes with high functional group tolerance. A family of polyoxotungstates covalently functionalized with boronic acids is reported. In the solid&#8208;state, the compounds are held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions (&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding). The resulting heterogeneous nanoscale particles form stable colloidal dispersions in acetonitrile and can be surface&#8208;functionalized with platinum nanoparticles by in&#8208;situ photoreduction. The resulting materials show excellent catalytic activity in hydrogenation of olefins and nitrobenzene derivatives under mild conditions (1 bar H2 and room temperature).</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry PdnL2n  Nanocages through Coordination&#8208;Sphere Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are popular host architectures assembled from ligands and metal ions/nodes. Assembling structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry MOCs with anisotropic cavities can be limited by the formation of statistical isomer libraries. We set out to investigate the use of primary coordination&#8208;sphere engineering (CSE) to bias isomer selectivity within homo&#8208; and heteroleptic PdnL2n cages. Unexpected differences in selectivities between alternative donor groups led us to recognise the significant impact of the second coordination sphere on isomer stabilities. From this, molecular&#8208;level insight into the origins of selectivity between cis and trans diastereoisomers was gained, highlighting the importance of both host&#8208;guest and host&#8208;solvent interactions, in addition to ligand design. This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low&#8208;symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, shape&#8208;shifting MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enables Efficient Pure Red Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With increasing ecological and environmental concerns, tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are competitive candidates for future displays because of their environmental friendliness, excellent photoelectric properties, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. Nonetheless, their electroluminescence (EL) performance still lags behind that of lead (Pb)&#8208;based PeLEDs due to the fast crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and undesired oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, leading to poor film morphology and coverage, as well as high density defects. Here, we propose a ligand engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;quality phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA2SnI4) perovskite films by using L&#8208;glutathione reduced (GSH) as surface ligands toward efficient pure red PEA2SnI4&#8208;based PeLEDs. We show that the hydrogen&#8208;bond and coordinate interactions between GSH and PEA2SnI4 effectively reduce the crystallization rate of the perovskites and suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and formation of defects. The improved pure red perovskite films not only show excellent uniformity, density, and coverage but also exhibit enhanced optical properties and stability. Finally, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 9.32% in the field of PEA2SnI4&#8208;based devices. This work demonstrates that ligand engineering represents a feasible route to enhance the EL performance of Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Sulfate Crystals with Strong Optical Anisotropy through &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Tailoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfate crystals typically exhibit minimal optical anisotropy due to the near&#8208;zero polarizability anisotropy (&#948;) of [SO4]2&#8208; tetrahedra, arising from highly symmetrical electron clouds. Recent research sought to enhance &#948; via chemical modifications, such as fluorination. However, the resultant crystals often maintain subpar optical anisotropy, frequently with birefringence values below 0.1. In this study, we have uncovered that &#948; can be significantly strengthened by chemically tailoring the tetrahedral [SO4]2&#8208; with anisotropic &#960;&#8208;conjugated modules. This has been demonstrated by several newly proposed S&#8208;O&#8208;Org (Org: &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic species) moieties, which show a sharp increase in &#948; based on theoretical computations. To further validate this experimentally, we synthesized and characterized six new 3&#8208;pyridinesulfonate crystals with the formula A(3&#8208;C5H4NSO3)&#183;xH2O (A = Li, Ag, K, Rb, Cs, and NH4; x = 0 and 1). Notably, these materials exhibit strong optical anisotropy, with birefringence values ranging from 0.240 to 0.312 at 546 nm. These values are approximately 23 to 145.5 times greater than those of corresponding sulfates, and they outperform a vast number of sulfate&#8208;related optical materials, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the title compounds exhibit diverse microstructure peculiarities influenced by the size and binding natures of the counter cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallizing Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast Proton Transport in Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) display great potential to be assembled into proton conductive membranes for their uniform and controllable pore structure, yet constructing self&#8208;standing COF membrane with high crystallinity to fully exploit their ordered crystalline channels for efficient ionic conduction remains a great challenge. Here, a macromolecular&#8208;mediated crystallization strategy is designed to manipulate the crystallization of self&#8208;standing COF membrane, where the &#8208;SO3H groups in introduced sulfonated macromolecule chains function as the sites to interact with the precursors of COF and thus offer long&#8208;range ordered template for membrane crystallization. The optimized self&#8208;standing COF membrane composed of highly&#8208;ordered nanopores exhibits high proton conductivity (72.9 mS cm&#8208;1 at 100% relative humidity and 20 &#176;C) and excellent flow battery performance, outperforming Nafion 212 and reported membranes. Meanwhile, the long&#8208;term run of membrane is achieved through the anchoring effect of flexible macromolecule chains. Our work provides inspiration to design self&#8208;standing COF membranes with ordered channels for permselective application.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent and Photoredox&#8208;Active Molybdenum(0) Complexes Competitive with Isoelectronic Ruthenium(II) Polypyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero&#8208;valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited&#8208;state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range. The molybdenum(0) complexes are stronger photoreductants than ruthenium(II) polypyridines and can therefore perform more challenging chemical reductions. The triplet nature of their luminescent MLCT states allows sensitization of photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to convert low&#8208;energy input radiation into higher&#8208;energy output fluorescence. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning luminescent molybdenum(0) complexes and highlights their application potential. Molybdenum is roughly 140 times more abundant and far cheaper than ruthenium, hence this research is relevant in the greater context of finding more sustainable alternatives to using precious and rare transition metals in photophysics and photochemistry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero-valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited-state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range. The molybdenum(0) complexes are stronger photoreductants than ruthenium(II) polypyridines and can therefore perform more challenging chemical reductions. The triplet nature of their luminescent MLCT states allows sensitization of photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation, to convert low-energy input radiation into higher-energy output fluorescence. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning luminescent molybdenum(0) complexes and highlights their application potential. Molybdenum is roughly 140 times more abundant and far cheaper than ruthenium, hence this research is relevant in the greater context of finding more sustainable alternatives to using precious and rare transition metals in photophysics and photochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Favoring CO Intermediate Stabilization and Protonation by Crown Ether for CO2 Electromethanation in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large&#8208;scale deployment of CO2 electroreduction is hampered by deficient carbon utilization in neutral and alkaline electrolytes due to CO2 loss into (bi)carbonates, while switching to acidic media mitigate carbonation but suffers from low product selectivity because of hydrogen evolution. Here we report a crown ether decoration strategy on Cu catalyst to enhance carbon utilization and selectivity of CO2 methanation under acidic condition. Macrocyclic 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 is found to enrich potassium cations near Cu electrode surface, simultaneously enhancing the interfacial electric field to stabilize *CO intermediate and accelerating water dissociation to boost *CO protonation. Remarkably, the mixture of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and Cu nanoparticles affords a CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.2% and a single pass carbon efficiency of 43.0% toward CO2 electroreduction in electrolyte with pH = 2. This study provides a facile strategy to promote CH4 selectivity and carbon utilization by modifying Cu catalysts with supramolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensional and Optoelectronic Tuning of Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Cs3Bi2I9&#8211;nBrn Single Crystals for Enhanced Hard X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic Bi&#8208;based perovskites have shown great potential in X&#8208;ray detection for their large absorption to X&#8208;rays, diverse low&#8208;dimensional structures, and eco&#8208;friendliness without toxic metals. However, they suffer from poor carrier transport properties compared to Pb&#8208;based perovskites. Here, we propose a mixed&#8208;halogen strategy to tune the structural dimensions and optoelectronic properties of Cs3Bi2I9&#8211;nBrn (0&#8804;n&#8804;9). Ten centimeter&#8208;sized single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman technique. Upon doping bromine to zero&#8208;dimensional Cs3Bi2I9, the crystal transforms into a two&#8208;dimensional structure as the bromine content reaches Cs3Bi2I8Br. Correspondingly, the optoelectronic properties are adjusted. Among these crystals, Cs3Bi2I8Br exhibits negligible ion migration, moderate resistivity and the best carrier transport capability. The sensitivities in 100 keV hard X&#8208;ray detection are 1.33 &#215; 104 and 1.74 &#215; 104 &#956;C Gyair&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at room temperature and 75 &#176;C, respectively, which are the highest among all reported bismuth perovskites. Moreover, the lowest detection limit of 28.64 nGyair s&#8211;1 and ultralow dark current drift of 9.12 &#215; 10&#8211;9 nA cm&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 are obtained owing to the high ionic activation energy. Our work demonstrates that Br incorporation is an effective strategy to enhance the X&#8208;ray detection performance by tuning the dimensional and optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Responsive Flexible Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of flexible, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials remains challenging owing to the quenching of their unstable triplet excitons via molecular motion. Therefore, a polymer matrix with Tg higher than room temperature is required to prevent polymer segment movement. In this study, a RTP material was developed by incorporating a 4&#8208;biphenylboronic acid (BPBA) phosphor into a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix (Tg = &#8722;27.1 &#176;C), which exhibits a remarkable UV&#8208;light&#8208;dependent oxygen consumption phosphorescence with a lifetime of 1275.7 ms. The adjustable RTP performance is influenced by the crystallinity and polymorph (&#945;, &#946;, and &#947; phases) fraction of PVDF, therefore, the low Tg of the PVDF matrix enables the polymeric segmental motion upon microwave irradiation. Consequently, a reduction in the crystallinity and an increase in the a phase fraction in PVDF film induces RTP after 2.45 GHz microwave irradiation. These findings open up new avenues for constructing crystalline and phase&#8208;dependent RTP materials while demonstrating a promising approach toward microwave detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Solvent Effect on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered as an ideal electrolyte system for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their superior compatibility with the sodium metal anode (SMA). However, the selection principle of ether solvents and the impact on solid electrolyte interphase formation are still unclear. Herein, we systematically compare the chain ether&#8208;based electrolyte and understand the relationship between the solvation structure and the interphasial properties. The linear ether solvent molecules with different terminal group lengths demonstrate remarkably distinct solvation effects, thus leading to different electrochemical performance as well as deposition morphologies for SMBs. Computational calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the terminal group length significantly regulates the electrolyte solvation structure and consequently influences the interfacial reaction mechanism of electrolytes on SMA. Cryogenic electron microscopy clearly reveals the difference in solid electrolyte interphase in various ether&#8208;based electrolytes. As a result, the 1,2&#8208;diethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%, which also realizes the stable cycling of Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a mass loading of ~9 mg cm&#8208;2 over 500 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;Diborylation of Alkynes with a Neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylation of alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent has been demonstrated. The transformation leads to the spontaneous introduction of two chemically easily distinguishable boryl groups at the same carbon center. This method finds applications in the controllable stepwise downstream functionalization of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes, as well as the one&#8208;pot synthesis of acylboranes.







Abstract
The incorporation of two distinct boryl groups at the same carbon center in organic molecules has attracted growing research interest due to its potential for facilitating controlled, precise synthesis through stepwise dual carbon&#8208;boron bond transformations. Here we report a method to access unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylalkene (UDBA) stereoselectively via the reaction of readily available alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent (NHC)BH2&#8208;Bpin (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Attributing to the chemically easily distinguishable nature of the sp2 and sp3 boryl moieties, controllable stepwise derivatization of the resultant UDBAs is realized. This process leads to various multifunctionalized olefins and organoborons, such as acylboranes, which are difficult to prepare by other methods.

Nevertheless, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and the high expression of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals from tumor cells impede therapeutic efficacy. To address these issues and improve the management of malignant tumors, in this study we developed a gene&#8208;editable palladium&#8208;based bioorthogonal nanoplatform, consisting of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system&#8208;linked Pd nanoclusters, and a hyaluronic acid surface layer (HBPdC). This HBPdC nanoplatform exhibited satisfactory tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency and triggered Fenton&#8208;like reactions in the tumor microenvironment to generate reactive oxygen species for chemodynamic therapy and macrophage M1 polarization, which directly eliminated tumor cells, and stimulated the antitumor response of macrophages. HBPdC could reprogram tumor cells through gene editing to reduce the expression of CD47 and adipocyte plasma membrane&#8208;associated protein, thereby promoting their recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Moreover, HBPdC induced the activation of sequestered prodrugs via bioorthogonal catalysis, enabling chemotherapy and thereby enhancing tumor cell death. Importantly, the Pd nanoclusters of HBPdC were sufficiently cleared through basic metabolic pathways, confirming their biocompatibility and biosafety. Therefore, by promoting macrophage phagocytosis, the HBPdC system developed herein, represents a highly promising antitumor toolset for cancer therapy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of energy&#8208;saving technology for the efficient separation of olefin and paraffin is highly important for the chemical industry. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 capsule containing a hydrophobic cavity, which can be used to encapsulate and separate propylene/propane. The successful encapsulation of propylene and propane by Fe4L6 cage in a water solution was documented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The binding constants K for the Fe4L6 cage toward propylene and propane were determined to be (5.0 &#177; 0.1) &#215; 103 M&#8208;1 and (2.1 &#177; 0.7) &#215; 104 M&#8208;1 in D2O at 25 &#176;C, respectively. Experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the cage exhibited multiple weak interactions with propylene and propane. The polymer&#8208;grade propylene (&gt;99.5%) can be obtained from a mixture of propylene and propane by using the Fe4L6 cage as a separation material in a U&#8208;shaped glass tube. This work provides a new strategy for the separation of olefin/paraffin.</dc:description>

         <title>Significant Strain Dissipation via Stiff&#8208;Tough Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Highly Stable Alloying Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pulverization of alloying anodes significantly restricts their use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This study presents a dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that incorporates finely dispersed Al nanoparticles within the LiPON matrix. This distinctive dual&#8208;phase structure imparts high stiffness and toughness to the integrated SEI film. In comparison to single&#8208;phase LiPON film, the optimized Al/LiPON dual&#8208;phase SEI film demonstrates a remarkable increase in fracture toughness by 317.8%, while maintaining stiffness, achieved through the substantial dissipation of strain energy. Application of the dual&#8208;phase SEI film on an Al anode leads to a 450% enhancement in cycling stability for lithium storage in dual&#8208;ion batteries. A similar enhancement in cycling stability for silicon anodes, which face severe volume expansion issues, is also observed, demonstrating the broad applicability of the dual&#8208;phase SEI design. Specifically, homogeneous Li&#8208;Al alloying has been observed in conventional LIBs, even when paired with a high mass loading LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode (7 mg cm&#8211;2). The dual&#8208;phase SEI film design can also accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Li&#8208;ions through interface electronic structure regulation. This dual&#8208;phase design can integrate stiffness and toughness into a single SEI film, providing a pathway to enhance both the structural stability and rate capability of alloying anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of M8Pd6 Supramolecular Cages Based on Metal&#8208;Center Lability for Differential Chiral Induction, Resolution and Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of isostructural supramolecular cages in rhombic dodecahedron shape have been assembled with distinct metal&#8208;coordination lability (M8Pd6&#8208;MOC&#8208;16, M = Ru2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+). The chirality transfer between metal&#8208;centers generally imposes homochirality on individual cages to lead to solvent&#8208;dependent spontaneous resolution of &#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;M8Pd6 enantiomers; however, their distinguishable stereochemical dynamics manifests differential chiral phenomena governed by the cage stability following the order of Ru8Pd6 &gt; Ni8Pd6 &gt; Fe8Pd6 &gt; Zn8Pd6. The highly labile Zn&#8208;centers endow Zn8Pd6 cage with conformational flexibility and deformation, enabling intrigue chiral&#8208;&#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;Zn8Pd6 to meso&#8208;&#916;4&#923;4&#8208;Zn8Pd6 transition induced by anions. The cage stabilization effect differs from inert Ru2+ to metastable Fe2+/Ni2+ and labile Zn2+, resulting in different chiral&#8208;guest induction. Strikingly, solvent&#8208;mediated host&#8208;guest interactions have been revealed for &#916;8/&#923;8&#8208;(Ru/Ni/Fe)8Pd6 cages to discriminate the chiral recognition of the guests with opposite chirality. These results demonstrate a versatile protocol to control the stereochemistry of MOCs based on the dynamic metal&#8208;centers, providing a guidance to maneuver cage chirality at a supramolecular level by virtue of solvent, anion and guest to benefit practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Systems for NOx Valorization in Organonitrogen Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic systems for NOx reduction species provide a promising way for synthetic value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds, which not only brings novel insights for handling environmental problems caused by NOx, but also pave a new clue for the development of electrosynthesis, application of water splitting, fixing nitrogen circle and understanding the origins of life to build a sustainable society.







Abstract
Inorganic nitrogen oxide (NOx) species, such as NO, NO2, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; generated from the decomposition of organic matters, volcanic eruptions and lightning activated nitrogen, play important roles in the nitrogen cycle system and exploring the origin of life. Meanwhile, excessive emission of NOx gases and residues from industry and transportation causes troubling problems to the environment and human health. How to efficiently handle these wastes is a global problem. In response to the growing demand for sustainability, scientists are actively pursuing sustainable electrochemical technologies powered by renewable energy sources and efficient utilization of hydrogen energy to convert NOx species into high&#8208;value organonitrogen chemicals. In this minireview, recent advances of electrocatalytic systems for NOx species valorization in organonitrogen synthesis are classified and described, such as amino acids, amide, urea, oximes, nitrile etc., that have been widely applied in medicine, life science and agriculture. Additionally, the current challenges including multiple side reactions and complicated paths, viable solutions along with future directions ahead in this field are also proposed. The coupling electrocatalytic systems provide a green mode for fixing nitrogen cycle bacteria and bring enlightenment to human sustainable development.

         <title>Homolytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phosphine&#8722;Quinone&#8208;Based Radical Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;electron transfer processes between sterically demanding triarylphosphines and quinones of appropriate electron&#8208;accepting character were investigated. Depending on the steric demand of the phosphine, P&#8722;O coupled adducts or C&#8722;H bond activation products were obtained, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds stepwise via transient radical ion pairs







Abstract
Herein, we present the formation of transient radical ion pairs (RIPs) by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) in phosphine&#8722;quinone systems and explore their potential for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds. PMes3 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reacts with DDQ (2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) with formation of the P&#8722;O bonded zwitterionic adduct Mes3P&#8722;DDQ (1), while the reaction with the sterically more crowded PTip3 (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) afforded C&#8722;H bond activation product Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2(DDQ)]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (2). UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that the latter reaction proceeds via initial SET, forming RIP [PTip3]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722;, and subsequent homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation, which was supported by DFT calculations. The isolation of analogous products, Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (4, TCQ=tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) and Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (8, oQtBu=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone), from reactions of PTip3 with Lewis&#8208;acid activated quinones, TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3 and oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3, respectively, further supports the proposed radical mechanism. As such, this study presents key mechanistic insights into the homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation by the synergistic action of radical ion pairs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;assembly of Copolymer&#8208;Capped Nanoparticles into Colloidal Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of binary nanoparticles capped with a layer of complementary copolymer ligands into well&#8208;defined colloidal molecules. By varying the irradiation duration and the order of mixing and irradiating, the assembly process yields clustered ABx and linear (AB)y structures (x is the coordination number of NP&#8208;Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters in the linear structure) at high precision and tunability.







Abstract
Colloidal molecules (CMs) are precisely defined assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) that mimic the structure of real molecules, but externally programming the precise self&#8208;assembly of CMs is still challenging. In this work, we show that the photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of complementary copolymer&#8208;capped binary NPs can be precisely controlled to form clustered ABx or linear (AB)y CMs at high yield (x is the coordination number of NP&#8208;Bs, and y is the repeating unit number of AB clusters). Under UV light irradiation, photolabile p&#8208;methoxyphenacyl groups of copolymers on NP&#8208;A*s are converted to carboxyl groups (NP&#8208;A), which react with tertiary amines of copolymers on NP&#8208;B to trigger the directional NP bonding. The x value of ABx can be precisely controlled between 1 and 3 by varying the irradiation duration and hence the amount of carboxyl groups generated on NP&#8208;As. Moreover, when NP&#8208;A* and NP&#8208;B are irradiated after mixing, the assembly process generates AB clusters or linear (AB)y structures with alternating sequence of the binary NPs. This assembly approach offers a simple yet non&#8208;invasive way to externally regulate the formation of various CMs on demand without the need of redesigning the surface chemistry of NPs for use in drug delivery, diagnostics, optoelectronics, and plasmonic devices.

         <title>Photoinduced [3+2] Cycloaddition of Carbenes and Nitriles: A Versatile Approach to Oxazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing singlet carbenes, we developed a versatile method for [3+2] cycloaddition with diverse nitriles to yield substituted oxazoles. Our approach can be extended to bis&#8208;oxazoles, isotope&#8208;labeled oxazoles, drug diversification, as well as natural product and drug synthesis. Integration of photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry demonstrated applicability, scalability, and robustness for oxazole synthesis.







Abstract
We have developed a photoinduced protocol for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important oxazole molecules using diazo&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;containing reactants. The process involves the initial photolysis of the diazo compound to afford singlet carbenes, which are tapped by nitriles in a [3+2] cycloaddition fashion to give substituted oxazoles. With di&#8208;nitrile compounds, useful bis&#8208;oxazoles were obtained. The applicability of the transformation is showcased through the expedient synthesis of small&#8208;molecule drugs and biologically relevant molecules such as felbinac, pimprinine, texamine, ugnenenazole etc. The protocol is also useful for the generation of 2H and 13C isotope labelled oxazoles. Merging photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry was demonstrated for scaling up the reaction. The non&#8208;requirement of metal catalysis or photosensitizers to harness the light energy with blue light sufficing the execution of the reaction makes it a versatile and general protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse oxazoles

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development of Non&#8208;Invasive Imaging Probes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular imaging is a rapidly growing platform for studying molecular and cellular events in living organisms. This review highlights recent advances in the chemical design of molecular probes with various imaging modalities such as PET, MRI, and optical imaging for early, real&#8208;time assessment of immune responses and prediction of therapeutic outcome in cancer immunotherapy by detecting expression and functional states of specific targets.







Abstract
The last two decades have witnessed a major revolution in the field of tumor immunology including clinical progress using various immunotherapy strategies. These advances have highlighted the potential for approaches that harness the power of the immune system to fight against cancer. While cancer immunotherapies have shown significant clinical successes, patient responses vary widely due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of tumors and immune responses, calling for reliable biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy. Especially, stratifying responding individuals from non&#8208;responders during the early stages of treatment could help avoid long&#8208;term damage and tailor personalized treatments. In efforts to develop non&#8208;invasive means for accurately evaluating and predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, multiple affinity&#8208;based agents targeting immune cell markers and checkpoint molecules have been developed and advanced to clinical trials. In addition, researchers have recently turned their attention to substrate and activity&#8208;based imaging probes that can provide real&#8208;time, functional assessment of immune response to treatment. Here, we highlight some of those recently designed probes that image functional proteases as biomarkers of cancer immunotherapy with a focus on their chemical design and detection modalities and discuss challenges and opportunities for the development of imaging tools utilized in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Densely Packed CO2 Aids Charge, Spin, and Lattice Ordering Partially Fluctuated in a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic phase transition temperature increased from 65 to 100&#8197;K via CO2 adsorption in a two&#8208;dimensional layered magnet composed of a paddlewheel&#8208;type diruthenium unit and TCNQ derivatives because of the suppression of charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure upon CO2 accommodation.







Abstract
Partial charge fluctuations in the charge&#8208;ordered state of a material, often triggered by structural disorders and/or defects, can significantly alter its physical characteristics, such as magnetic long&#8208;range ordering. However, it is difficult to post&#8208;chemically fix such accidental partial fluctuations to reconstruct a uniform charge&#8208;ordered state. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;aided charge ordering demonstrated in a CO2&#8208;post&#8208;captured layered magnet, [{Ru2(o&#8208;ClPhCO2)4}2{TCNQ(OMe)2}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CO2 (1&#8835;CO2; o&#8208;ClPhCO2&#8722;=ortho&#8208;chlorobenzoate; TNCQ(OMe)2=2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane). Pristine porous layered magnet 1 had a partially charge&#8208;fluctuated ordered state, which provided ferrimagnetic ordering at TC=65&#8197;K. Upon loading CO2, 1 adsorbed one mole of CO2, forming 1&#8835;CO2, and raising TC to 100&#8197;K. This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post&#8208;accessible host&#8211;guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenative Deuteration of Halides over a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework MFM&#8208;300(Cr) acts as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) with high deuterium incorporation. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ EPR spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Deuterium labelling of organic compounds is an important process in chemistry. We report the first example of photocatalytic dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) over a metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;300(Cr), using CD3CN as the deuterium source at room temperature. MFM&#8208;300(Cr) catalyses high deuterium incorporation and shows excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway. This protocol removes the use of precious&#8208;metal catalysts from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art processes based upon direct hydrogen isotope exchange and shows high photocatalytic stability, thus enabling multiple catalytic cycles.

         <title>Ag+&#8208;Doped InSe Nanosheets for Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer toward Large&#8208;Current Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to a single liquid product of ethanol in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer is achieved by Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets. Ag+ doping can tailor active sites for maneuvering reaction intermediates toward ethanol production while enhancing the durability of active sites at high current densities.







Abstract
It is an appealing approach to CO2 utilization through CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to ethanol at high current density; however, the commonly used Cu&#8208;based catalysts cannot sustain large current during CO2ER despite their capability for ethanol production. Herein, we report that Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies can address this grand challenge in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the Ag+ doping, which can tailor the electronic structure of InSe while diversifying catalytically active sites, enables the formation of key reaction intermediates and their sequential evolution into ethanol. More importantly, such a material can well work for large&#8208;current conditions in MEA electrolyzers with In2+ species stabilized via electron transfer from Ag to Se. Remarkably, in an MEA electrolyzer by coupling cathodic CO2ER with anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimal catalyst exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 68.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 186.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on the cathode with a full&#8208;cell ethanol energy efficiency of 26.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V. This work opens an avenue for large&#8208;current production of ethanol from CO2 with high selectivity and energy efficiency by rationally designing electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Catalytic Activity of a Pincer Complex of Rhodium(I) by Supramolecular and Redox Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties of a (CNC)&#8208;pincer Rh(I) complex decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety have been shown to be modified in response to supramolecular (coronene) or redox (fluoride) additives. This leads to a significant modification of its catalytic activity toward the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids.







Abstract
We report the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]+, in which CNC&#8722;NDI refers to a pincer&#8208;CNC ligand decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety. Due to the presence of the planar CNC ligand and the naphthalenediimide moiety, the electronic nature of the complex can be modulated by means of supramolecular and redox stimuli, respectively. The metal complex shows a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interaction with coronene. This interaction has an impact on the electron&#8208;richness of the metal, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching band to a lower frequency.

     alt="Tuning the Catalytic Activity of a Pincer Complex of Rhodium(I) by Supramolecular and Redox Stimuli"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic properties of a (CNC)-pincer Rh(I) complex decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety have been shown to be modified in response to supramolecular (coronene) or redox (fluoride) additives. This leads to a significant modification of its catalytic activity toward the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in which CNC&#8722;NDI refers to a pincer-CNC ligand decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety. Due to the presence of the planar CNC ligand and the naphthalenediimide moiety, the electronic nature of the complex can be modulated by means of supramolecular and redox stimuli, respectively. The metal complex shows a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960;-stacking interaction with coronene. This interaction has an impact on the electron-richness of the metal, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching band to a lower frequency. The addition of tetrabutylammonium fluoride facilitates the sequential one- and two-electron reduction of the NDI moiety of the ligand, thus resulting in a situation in which the ligand can increase its electron-donor strength in two levels. The nature of the interaction with the fluoride anion was studied computationally. The catalytic activity of the [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex was tested in the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids, where it is observed that the activity of the catalyst can be modulated between four levels of activity, which correspond to i) the use of the unmodified catalyst, ii) catalyst+coronene, iii) catalyst+2&#8197;equivalents of fluoride, and iv) catalyst+5&#8197;equivalents of fluoride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Reactor Partitioning Enzyme and Prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8 for NADPH&#8208;Sensitive In Situ Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;prodrug therapies have shown unique advantages in efficiency, selectivity, and specificity of in vivo prodrug activation. However, precise spatiotemporal control of both the enzyme and its substrate at the target site, preservation of enzyme activity, and in situ substrate depletion due to low prodrug delivery efficiency continue to be great challenges. Here, we propose a novel core&#8208;shell reactor partitioning enzyme and prodrug by ZIF&#8208;8, which integrates an enzyme with its substrate and increases the drug loading capacity (DLC) using a prodrug as the building ligand to form a Zn&#8208;prodrug shell. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is immobilized in ZIF&#8208;8, and the antitumor drug dacarbazine (DTIC) is coordinated and deposited in its outer layer with a high DLC of 43.6 &#177; 0.8%. With this configuration, a much higher prodrug conversion efficiency of CYP450 (36.5 &#177; 1.5%) and lower IC50 value (26.3 &#177; 2.6 mg/mL) are measured for B16&#8208;F10 cells with a higher NADPH concentration than those of L02 cells and HUVECs. With the tumor targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, this core&#8208;shell enzyme reactor shows a high tumor suppression rate of 96.6 &#177; 1.9% and provides a simple and versatile strategy for enabling in vivo biocatalysis to be more efficient, selective, and safer.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Fabrication of Binary Organic Solar Cells with High Molecular Weight D18 Yields Record 19.65% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, inspired by the principles of a pressure cooker, we utilized a high&#8208;pressure method to address the processing challenges associated with high molecular weight polymers. Through this approach, we successfully dissolved high molecular weight D18 in chloroform at 100&#176;C within a pressure&#8208;tight vial. The increased steam pressure raised the boiling point and dissolving capacity of chloroform, enabling the creation of a hybrid film with superior properties, including more ordered molecular arrangement, increased crystallinity, extended exciton diffusion length, and improved phase morphology. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18:L8&#8208;BO prepared using this high&#8208;pressure method achieved an outstanding energy conversion efficiency of 19.65%, setting a new record for binary devices to date. Furthermore, this high&#8208;pressure method was successfully applied to fabricate OSCs based on other common systems, leading to significant enhancements in device performance. In summary, this research introduces a universal method for processing high molecular weight D18 materials, ultimately resulting in the highest performance reported for binary organic solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Aryl&#8208;substituted Terminal Alkynes Involving in situ&#8208;Generated &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/ C&#8208;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40%.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Upcycling of PET Waste to Calcium Terephthalate for Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biotechnological recycling offers a promising solution to address the environmental concerns associated with waste plastics, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), widely utilized in packaging materials and textiles. To advance the development of a bio&#8208;based circular plastic economy, innovative upcycling strategies capable of generating higher&#8208;value products are needed. In this study, we enhanced the enzymatic depolymerization of waste PET by incorporating highly concentrated calcium ions (up to 1 m) to the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by the best currently known enzyme LCCICCG. The presence of calcium ions not only improved the thermal stability and activity of the biocatalyst but also significantly reduced the consumption of base required to maintain optimal pH levels. Employing optimized conditions at 80&#176;C for 12 h, we successfully converted ~84% of the waste PET (200 g L&#8208;1) into solid hydrated calcium terephthalate (CaTP&#8226;3H2O) as the primary product instead of soluble terephthalate salt. CaTP&#8226;3H2O was easily purified and employed as a raw material for battery electrode production, exhibiting an initial reversible specific capacity of 164.2 mAh g&#8208;1. Through techno&#8208;economic analysis, we conclusively demonstrated that the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based synthesis of CaTP is a superior PET upcycling strategy than the secondary synthesis method employing recycled terephthalic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Frameworks Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diversified guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here the first study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, and I&#8208;, for developing hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons, enabling the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, and I&#8208;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behav&#8208;iors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ~ 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF = 7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas stream exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cationic boron&#8208;containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring&#8208;contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring&#8208;expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B2N3C pentafulvene derivative.







Abstract
N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8722;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.

         <title>Proton Intercalation/De&#8208;intercalation Chemistry in Phenazine&#8208;based Anode for Hydronium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

The fast H3O+ insertion/extraction reaction of the diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF hydronium&#8208;ion battery with superior performances.







Abstract
Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), attractive energy density (182.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (31.2&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>

         <dc:description>
Bayesian optimization has been successfully employed to accelerate discovery of the high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres for catalytic CH4 combustion. The target T50 could reach a minimum after only two iterations, and the workload can be greatly reduced from thousands to as less as 18&#8197;experiments.







Abstract
Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio (the Pt/Pd mole ratio ranges from 1/2.33&#8211;1/9.09, and Ce/Zr from 1/0.22&#8211;1/0.35), which directly results in a lower conversion temperature (T50 approaching to 330&#8201;&#176;C) than ones reported hitherto. Consequently, the best sample obtained could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18&#8197;experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems, for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloadditions of Indoles with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Indoline Fused Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes

         <dc:description>
A silver Lewis acid catalyzes dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutanes to afford indoline fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) bearing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers in high yields and with an opposite regioselectivity compared to the classical pathway.







Abstract
Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are becoming ever more important in drug design and development as bridged scaffolds that provide underexplored chemical space, but are difficult to access. Here a silver&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of indoline fused BCHs from N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutane precursors is described. The strain&#8208;release dearomative cycloaddition operates under mild conditions, tolerating a wide range of functional groups. It is capable of forming BCHs with up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers, achieving yields of up to 99&#8201;%. In addition, a scale&#8208;up experiment and the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts further highlighted the synthetic utility.

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoiniferter RAFT polymerization was used to tune the dispersity in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers (up to ca. 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as well as in multiblock copolymers. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogeneous radical source, visible&#8208;light regulation, and high end&#8208;group fidelity and holds great potential for the synthesis of pre&#8208;designed materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.







Abstract
The synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence, and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent highly living nature of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by the addition of acid. In addition to a switchable chain&#8208;transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in terms of dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that the highly living nature was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential for the synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst allows efficient total water splitting without scavengers by concurrently enriching electron density at the point&#8208;of&#8208;use for enhanced catalysis and delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF for oxygen evolution. Notably, our multifunctional interface boosts hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold when compared to emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers.







Abstract
The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8722;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines was developed, which allows to achieve a kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines representing a straightforward route to construct C&#8722;B axial chirality. Two kinds of C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines are then readily diversified into a range of chiral intermediates, as well as transformed into potential chiral ligand.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules, scale&#8208;up reaction, and applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2-benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2-benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2-aryl-1,2-benzazaborines and 3-substituted 2-aryl-1,2-benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late-stage modification of complex molecules, scale-up reaction, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Affinity &#8220;Synthavidin&#8221; Receptor for Squaraine Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocyclic host binds squaraine dyes with exceptional affinity and selectivity in water, forming stable complexes showing near&#8208;IR fluorescence. These properties suggest application as a &#8220;supramolecular glue&#8221;, complementing the widely used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin pairing.







Abstract
Strong&#8208;binding host&#8211;guest pairings in aqueous media have potential as &#8220;supramolecular glues&#8221; in biomedical techniques, complementing the widely&#8208;used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin combination. We have previously found that squaraine dyes are bound very strongly by tetralactam macrocycles possessing anthracenyl units as cavity walls. Here we show that replacing the anthracenes with pentacyclic 5,7,12,14&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraoxapentacene (TOP) units generates receptors which bind squaraines with increased affinities (around Ka=1010&#8197;m&#8722;1) and improved selectivities. Binding can be followed through changes to squaraine fluorescence and absorbance. The TOP units are easy to prepare and potentially variable, while the TOP&#8208;based receptor shows improved photostability, both in itself and in complex with squaraines. The results suggest that this system could prove valuable in the further development of practical &#8220;synthavidin&#8221; chemistry.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;Regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a sonosensitizer by using superlattices for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with sonication&#8208;triggered drug release. Introducing Fe(III) through coordinated interactions and changing the Fe(III) content can efficiently enhance and modulate the band gap and improve the outcomes of SDT. Benefiting from the use of Fe(III) as a contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;guided and synergistic therapy can be realized.







Abstract
Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable band gaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesized, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8722;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realize the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the band gap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitizers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customized treatments.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline polymers. Herein we report the room temperature and scalable synthesis of two isostructural COFs, modulated by the introduction of fluorine atoms, obtaining an extended framework with record number of F per pore. The substitution produces a dramatical increase of selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis, with a response comparable to other noble electrocatalysts.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062&#8197;V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757&#8197;s&#8722;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Novel Biocatalysts from Specialized Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are increasingly valuable as biocatalysts in synthetic chemistry. Many novel biocatalysts have emerged from the study of secondary metabolism, where rare and unusual reactions take place. In this review, we explore biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges, including cyclization, C&#8722;H functionalization, and cross&#8208;coupling, among others, offering unique opportunities for green chemistry.







Abstract
Enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable (bio)catalysts that complement existing synthetic methods. However, the range of biotransformations used in the laboratory is limited. Here we give an overview on the biosynthesis&#8208;inspired discovery of novel biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges. Prominent examples from this dynamic field highlight remarkable enzymes for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free amide formation and modification, control of pericyclic reactions, stereoselective hetero&#8208; and polycyclizations, atroposelective aryl couplings, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations, introduction of ring strain, and N&#8722;N bond formation. We also explore unusual functions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, radical SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes, flavoproteins, and enzymes recruited from primary metabolism, which offer opportunities for synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, directed evolution, and catalyst design.

         <title>Switchable Organocatalysis from N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Carbodiimide Adducts with Tunable Release Temperature
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts are used as thermally labile precursors for NHC organocatalysis with excellent temporal control. We introduce a new paradigm for controlling the reaction profile by using perturbations to the CDI &#8220;mask&#8221;, instead of the NHC. Three test reactions are compared to present practical considerations for designing and choosing appropriate masks.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different para&#8208;substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC&#8208;CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbene-carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) adducts are used as thermally labile precursors for NHC organocatalysis with excellent temporal control. We introduce a new paradigm for controlling the reaction profile by using perturbations to the CDI &#8220;mask&#8221;, instead of the NHC. Three test reactions are compared to present practical considerations for designing and choosing appropriate masks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC-carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC-catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC-CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox ligand enabled the construction of diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition&#8208;metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram&#8208;scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.

         <title>Synthesis of Neocaesalpin A, AA, and Nominal Neocaesalpin K
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoids neocaesalpin A, AA and nominal neocaesalpin K was achieved through use of a redox&#8208;flexible platform as key intermediate. We delineate an approach that enables novel late&#8208;stage oxidation of a furfuryl acetate under mild conditions to furnish the characteristic butenolide found in the neocaesalpins.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoid neocaesalpin A (1) is disclosed. At the heart of the synthesis lies an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that rapidly assembles the target framework from commercial materials. A carefully orchestrated sequence of oxidations secured the desired oxygenation pattern. Late&#8208;stage release of the characteristic butenolide occurred through a novel mercury(II)&#8208;mediated furan oxidation. Successful extension of the route allowed preparation of neocaesalpin AA (2) as well as nominal neocaesalpin K (3) and suggested structural revision of neocaesalpin K, leading to the hypothesis that the two are likely the same natural product with correct assignment as 2.

         <title>Controlling the Assembly of Cellulose&#8208;Based Oligosaccharides through Sequence Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides were designed to generate carbohydrate assemblies with tunable shapes and properties. Rod&#8208; or square&#8208;like crystalline materials as well as supramolecular hydrogels were obtained following systematic modifications of the glycan primary sequences. Synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based materials could offer new tools to material scientists and supramolecular chemists.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of biaryl monophosphines has been successfully accomplished with exceptional efficacy and remarkable functional group tolerance. Importantly, this transformation was achieved without the need for external photosensitizers, by synergistically combining visible light photoredox catalysis and P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation. Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation of the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO with the Faradaic efficiencies for C2+ products was established through combined reactivity and spectroscopic investigations. The CO binding energy is a relevant but incomplete descriptor for the selectivity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2RR. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (CuCO2) and the further reduction of CO (CuCO) is identified as another key descriptor.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies (
) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of 
 with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on 
 is observed on OD&#8722;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first parent metallocene dication is reported. Nickelocene was twice deelectronated, i.e. single&#8208;electron oxidized, by [NO]+ in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The [NiCp2]+ and [NiCp2]2+ cations were isolated as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salts and were fully characterized by NMR, CV and XRD analysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8901;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (Cp = C5H5; RF=C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave quasi reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8594;1) and +1.17&#8197;V (1&#8594;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8197;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6&#8197;ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8901;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Polynucleotide Brush Growth on DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel strategies allow for both spatial and temporal control of polynucleotide brush modification on DNA origami through activation and regeneration of initiation sites using restriction enzymes in combination with TdT&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic polymerization. Spatiotemporal control of brush growth provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to supracolloidal assembly.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides an approach to create precise, tunable, and biocompatible nanostructures for biomedical applications. However, the stability of these structures is severely compromised in biological milieu due to their fast degradation by nucleases. Recently, we showed how enzymatic polymerization could be harnessed to grow polynucleotide brushes of tunable length and location on the surface of DNA origami nanostructures, which greatly enhances their nuclease stability. Here, we report on strategies that allow for both spatial and temporal control over polymerization through activatable initiation, cleavage, and regeneration of polynucleotide brushes using restriction enzymes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes in a spatiotemporally controlled way provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60 and C70 Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAC&#8208;2 (Br substituted) instead of PAC&#8208;3 (CH3 substituted) exhibit fullerene encapsulation, and selective capture of C70 in various carbon soot. The induced chiroptical properties of C60 and C70 by R/S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and new mirror&#8208;symmetry CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes.







Abstract
Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8211;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.

         <title>Nucleation and Crystallization in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskites using Formamidinium&#8208;based Organic Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conjugated organic semiconductor spacers have drawn wide attention in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites and FA has been widely used as A&#8208;site cation in high&#8208;performance 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers have rarely been investigated in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. Here, we developed two FA&#8208;based spacers containing thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (TT) and 2,2'&#8208;bithiophene (BT) units, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, for 2D RP PSCs. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of TTFA&#8208;Pb and BTFA&#8208;Pb from sol&#8208;gel to film were investigated using in&#8208;situ optical microscopy and in&#8208;situ GIWAXS measurements. It is found that the TTFA spacer could reduce the energy barrier of nucleation and induces crystal vertical orientation of 2D perovskite by forming larger clusters in precursor solution, resulting in much improved film quality. Benefiting from the enlarged crystal grains, reduced exciton binding energy, and decreased electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficient, the photovoltaic device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 5) achieved a champion efficiency of 19.41%, which is a record for 2D RP PSCs with FA&#8208;based spacers. Our work provides deep understanding of the nucleation and crystallization process of 2D RP perovskite films and highlights the great potential of FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers in highly efficient 2D PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration Through Chemical Polymerization and Chemical Chelation Toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The migration of ions is known to be associated with various detrimental phenomena, including current density&#8208;voltage hysteresis, phase segregation, etc., which significantly limit the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, impeding their progress toward commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating a polymerizable organic small molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), into the perovskite film to form a crosslinked polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking. The carbonyl and amino groups in Apronal effectively interact with shallow defects, such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide vacancies, leading to the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity and reduced lattice strain. Furthermore, the introduction of P&#8208;Apronal improves energy level alignment, and facilitates charge carrier extraction and transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 25.09%. Importantly, P&#8208;Apronal can effectively suppress the migration of I&#8208; ions and improve the long&#8208;term stability of the devices. The present strategy sets forth a path to attain long&#8208;term stability and enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The migration of ions is known to be associated with various detrimental phenomena, including current density-voltage hysteresis, phase segregation, etc., which significantly limit the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, impeding their progress toward commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating a polymerizable organic small molecule monomer, N-carbamoyl-2-propan-2-ylpent-4-enamide (Apronal), into the perovskite film to form a crosslinked polymer (P-Apronal) through thermal crosslinking. The carbonyl and amino groups in Apronal effectively interact with shallow defects, such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide vacancies, leading to the formation of high-quality films with enhanced crystallinity and reduced lattice strain. Furthermore, the introduction of P-Apronal improves energy level alignment, and facilitates charge carrier extraction and transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 25.09%. Importantly, P-Apronal can effectively suppress the migration of I- ions and improve the long-term stability of the devices. The present strategy sets forth a path to attain long-term stability and enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;cost Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptor Enables Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Modules for Multi&#8208;scene Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, with highly tunable light&#8208;response ranges, offer significant potential for use in driving low&#8208;power consumption off&#8208;grid electronics in multi&#8208;scenarios. However, development of photoactive layer materials that can meet simultaneously the requirements of diverse irradiation conditions is a still challenging task. Herein, a low&#8208;cost fully non&#8208;fused acceptor (denoted GS60) featuring well&#8208;matched absorption spectra with solar, scattered light and artificial light radiation was designed and synthesized. Systematic characterizations revealed that GS60 possessed outstanding photoelectron properties and ideal morphology, which resulted in reduced voltage loss and suppressed charge recombination. By blending with non&#8208;fused ring polymer PTVT&#8208;T, the as&#8208;obtained GS60 based devices&#160;achieved good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1%, a high value for the cells based on non&#8208;fused ring bulk heterojunction. Besides, manufactured large&#8208;area OPV modules based on PTVT&#8208;T:GS60 yielded PCEs of 11.2%, 11.8%, 12.1%, 23.1%, and 20.3% under irradiation of AM 1.5G, natural light of cloudy weather, natural light in shadow, laser and indoor, respectively.&#160;PTVT&#8208;T:GS60 devices exhibited considerable potential in terms of improving photostability and reducing material cost. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, and extended potential of medium bandgap acceptors based OPV cells used in various application scenarios.</dc:description>

in the face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure, remains a mystery. Here we show that a delicate interplay between many&#8208;body effects, vibrational contributions and dispersion interactions obtained from relativistic density functional theory offers an answer to this long&#8208;standing controversy. It also sheds light on the Periodic Table of Crystal Structures.

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the &#160;difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites.&#160;By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The three&#8208;coordinate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligated aluminum cations [(NHC)&#183;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (NHC = IMeMe4, IiPrMe5, IiPr 6, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) were prepared via hydride abstraction of the alanes (NHC)&#183;AlHMes2 (NHC = IMeMe1, IiPrMe2, IiPr 3) using [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; in toluene as hydride acceptor.

According to a theoretical and experimental assessment of the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the [(IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2]+ cation is the acidity larger than that of B(C6F5)3 and of similar magnitude as reported for Al(C6F5)3.

         <dc:description>Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4.

         <title>Exploration of chemical diversity in intercellular quorum sensing signalling systems in prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community&#8208;wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended&#8208;connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of&#160;N&#8208;acyl homoserine lactones (HSL) and the aryl HSL&#160;p&#8208;coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;ol and autoinducer&#8208;2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six fully signal and promoter orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community&#8208;wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community-wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended-connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of&#160;N-acyl homoserine lactones (HSL) and the aryl HSL&#160;p-coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol and autoinducer-2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six fully signal and promoter orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community-wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand-receptor interactions.

         <title>Toughening Brittle Bio&#8208;P3HB with Synthetic P3HB of Engineered Stereomicrostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788 kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to ~30 MPa, fracture strain to ~800%, and toughness to 135 MJ m&#8208;3 (&gt;120&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90 wt.% dramatically enhances its ductility from ~5% to 95 &#8211; 450% and optical clarity from 19% to 85% visible light transmittance, while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1 GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35 MPa), and melting temperature (160 &#8211; 170 &#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Conversion of Boronic Esters into Enones using Methoxyallene:&#160;Application in the Total Synthesis of 10&#8208;Deoxymethynolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enones are widely utilized linchpin functional groups in chemical synthesis and molecular biology. We herein report the direct conversion of boronic esters into enones using commercially available methoxyallene as a three&#8208;carbon building block. Following boronate complex formation by reaction of the boronic ester with lithiated&#8208;methoxyallene, protonation triggers a stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration before oxidation generates the enone. The protocol shows broad substrate scope and complete enantiospecificity is observed with chiral migrating groups. In addition, various electrophiles could be used to induce 1,2&#8208;migration and give a much broader range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized enones. Finally, the methodology was applied to a 14&#8208;step synthesis of the enone&#8208;containing polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination of Tau Amyloids Promoted by the E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease&#8208;specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site&#8208;specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin&#8208;modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP&#8208;mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell&#8208;based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selective NMR experiments provide rapid access to important structural information, and are essential to tackle the analysis of large molecules and complex mixtures. Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments are particularly useful, as they can rapidly select signals that overlap with other signals. Here, we describe a novel type of single&#8208;scan ultraselective NMR experiments that is robust against the effects of translational molecular diffusion, and thus make it possible to improve significantly the sensitivity of the experiment. This will largely broaden the applicability of this powerful class of experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;C2 Single&#8208;Atoms Electrocatalyst Facilitate the efficient electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, yet challenging in activity, selectivity, and cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;, Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8208;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8208;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7 mA cm&#8208;2, and a turnover frequency reached as high as 2756 h&#8208;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;C2 structure not only endowed Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8208;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8226;&#8208;transferring mechanism for e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 and offers a protocol for the preparation of two&#8208;coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise sequence&#8208;defined polymers (SDPs) with uniform chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain structure including chain length, unit sequence and end functionalities, represent the pinnacle of sophistication in the realm of polymer science. For example, the absolute control over the unit sequence of SDPs allows for bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with hierarchical microstructures and functions. Accompanied with the development of synthetic techniques towards precision SDPs, the decoding of SDP sequences and construction of advanced functions irreplaceable with other synthetic materials is of central importance. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in SDP sequencing techniques including tandem mass spectrometry (MS), chemically assisted primary MS, as well as other non&#8208;destructive sequencing methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we delve into the promising prospects of SDP functions in the area of cutting&#8208;edge biological research. Topics of exploration include gene delivery systems, the development of hybrid materials combining SDPs and nucleic acids, protein recognition and regulation, as well as the interplay between chirality and biological functions. A brief outlook towards the future directions of SDPs is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Paradigm of Reaction Optimization in Flow with a Priori Computational Reaction Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, provide mechanistic insight, contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing Chemical Diversity of B2N2 Anthracene Derivatives by Introducing Continuous Multiple Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the chemical diversity of organic semiconductors is essential to develop efficient electronic devices. In particular, the replacement of carbon&#8211;carbon (CC) bonds with isoelectronic boron&#8211;nitrogen (BN) bonds allows precise modulation of the electronic properties of semiconductors without significant structural changes. While some researchers have reported the preparation of B2N2 anthracene derivatives with two BN bonds, no compounds with continuous multiple BN units have been prepared yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a B2N2 anthracene derivative with a BNBN unit formed by converting the BOBN unit at the zigzag edge. Compared to the all&#8208;carbon analog 2&#8208;phenylanthracene, BNBN anthracene exhibits significant variations in CC bond length and a larger highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. The experimentally determined bond lengths and electronic properties of BNBN anthracene are confirmed through theoretical calculations. The BOBN anthracene organic light&#8208;emitting diode, used as a blue host, exhibits a low driving voltage. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of larger acenes with multiple BN units and potential applications in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly&#8208;Knitted Hierarchical Porous Organometallic Polymer&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Site Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent times, heterogenization of homogeneous molecular catalysts onto various porous solid support structures has attracted significant research focus as a method for combining the advantages of both homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysis. The design of highly efficient, structurally robust and reusable heterogenized single&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reaction is a critical challenge that needs to be accomplished to implement a sustainable and practical CO2&#8208;looped renewable energy cycle. This study demonstrated a heterogenized catalyst [Ir&#8208;HCP&#8208;(B/TPM)] containing a molecular Ir&#8211;abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Ir&#8208;aNHC) catalyst self&#8208;supported by hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked polymer (HCP), in catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to inorganic formate (HCO2&#8722;) salt which is a prospective candidate for direct formate fuel cells (DFFC). By employing this unique and first approach of utilizing a directly&#8208;knitted HCP&#8208;based organometallic single&#8208;site catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCO2&#8722; in aqueous medium, extremely high activity of single&#8208;run turnover number (TON) up to 50816 was achieved which is the highest so far considering all the heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction in water. Additionally, the catalyst featured excellent reusability furnishing a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10 cycles with just 1.6% loss in activity per cycle. Overall, the new catalyst displayed attributes that are important for developing tangible catalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangle Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl Sites for Superior Photocatalytic Molecular Oxygen Activation and NO Oxidation of BiOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO2 emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl sites on a Cl&#8208;terminated, (001) facet&#8208;exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one&#8208;electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8226;O2&#8210;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO3&#8210; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis. By simultaneously tuning intermediates and products, the Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl&#8208;landen BiOCl achieved &gt; 90% NO conversion to favorable NO3&#8210; of high selectivity (&gt; 97%) in 10 min under visible light, with the undesired NO2 concentration below 20 ppb. Both the activity and the selectivity of Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl sites surpass those of BiOCl surface sites (38% NO conversion, 67% NO3&#8210; selectivity) or control O&#8208;Ag1&#8208;O sites on a benchmark photocatalyst P25 (67% NO conversion and 87% NO3&#8210; selectivity). This study develops new single&#8208;atom sites for the performance enhancement of semiconductor photocatalysts, and also provides a facile pathway to manipulate the reactive oxygen species production for efficient pollutant removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;native Intramolecular Radical Cyclization Catalyzed by a B12&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the unique reactivity of vitamin B12 and its derivatives, B12&#8208;dependent enzymes remain underutilized in biocatalysis. In this study, we repurpose the B12&#8208;dependent transcription factor CarH to enable non&#8208;native radical cyclization reactions. An engineered variant of this enzyme, CarH*, catalyzes the formation &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams via either redox&#8208;neutral or reductive ring closure with marked enhancement of reactivity and selectivity relative to the free B12 cofactor. CarH* also catalyzes an unusual spirocyclization via dearomatization of pendant arenes to produce bicyclic 1,3&#8208;diene products instead of 1,4&#8208;dienes provided by existing methods. These results and associated mechanistic studies highlight the importance of protein scaffolds for controlling the reactivity of B12 and expanding the synthetic utility of B12&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper by Reactive Ionic Liquid and Native Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) on copper (Cu) shows promise for higher&#8208;value products beyond CO. However, challenges such as the limited CO2 solubility, high overpotentials, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical realization. We propose a functionalized ionic liquid (IL) which generates ion&#8208;CO2 adducts and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) upon CO2 absorption to modulate CO2RR on Cu in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. As revealed by transient voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) complemented with image charge augmented quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanics (IC&#8208;QM/MM) computations, a unique microenvironment is constructed. In this microenvironment, the catalytic activity is primarily governed by the IL and HBD concentrations; former controlling the double layer thickness and the latter modulating the local proton availability. This translates to ample CO2 availability, reduced overpotential, and suppressed HER where C4 products are obtained. This study deepens the understanding of electrolyte effects in CO2RR and the role of IL ions towards electrocatalytic microenvironment design.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different&#160;&#949;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms; in part, due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as&#160;de novo&#160;cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause increase in the acetylation H3K18.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking Photo CO2&#160;Reduction by Altering Lewis Acidic Sites in Metalated&#8208;Porous Organic Polymer for Adjustable H2/CO Ratio in Syngas Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;we have specifically designed two metalated porous organic polymers&#160;(Zn&#8208;POP&#160;and&#160;Co&#8208;POP) for syngas (CO+H2) production from gaseous CO2. The variable H2/CO ratio of syngas with the highest efficiency was produced in water medium (without an organic hole scavenger and photosensitiser) by&#160;utilizing the basic principle of Lewis acid/base chemistry. Also,&#160;we observed the formation of entirely different major products during photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and water splitting with the help of the two catalysts, where CO (145.65 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) and H2&#160;(434.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) production were preferentially obtained over&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;&amp;&#160;Zn&#8208;POP,&#160;respectively. The&#160;higher electron density/better Lewis&#8217;s base nature of&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;was investigated further using XPS, XANES, and NH3&#8208;TPD studies, which considerably improve CO2&#160;activation capacity. Moreover, the structure&#8208;activity relationship was confirmed&#160;via in&#8208;situ&#160;DRIFTS and DFT studies, which demonstrated the formation of COOH* intermediate along with the thermodynamic feasibility of CO2&#160;reduction over&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;while water splitting occurred preferentially over&#160;Zn&#8208;POP.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8208; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8208; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8208; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in&#8208;situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8208;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS&#8208;HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8208;C), FeACs/NPS&#8208;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS&#8208;HC. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with FeACs/NPS&#8208;HC as cathodic catalyst exhibits all&#8208;round superiority to Pt/C and most Fe&#8208;based ADCs. This work provides an exemplary method for establishing atomic&#8208;cluster catalysts with engineered S&#8208;dominated coordination and hollowed carbon matrix, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication and optimization of advanced ADCs.</dc:description>

         <title>High Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8208;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S = 13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;benzamide Directed Formation of a Single Crystalline Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Crosslinked Organic Framework and Its Boron Trifluoride Uptake and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron trifluoride (BF3) is a highly corrosive gas widely used in industry. Confining BF3 in porous materials ensures safe and convenient handling and prevents its degradation. Hence, it is highly desired to develop porous materials with high adsorption capacity, high stability, and resistance to BF3 corrosion. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Lewis basic single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) for BF3 storage and its application in catalysis. Specifically, we introduced self&#8208;complementary ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties to direct the formation of highly organized hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks, which were subsequently photo&#8208;crosslinked to generate HCOFs. The HCOF&#8208;50 features Lewis basic thioether linkages and electron&#8208;rich pore surfaces for BF3 uptake. As a result, HCOF&#8208;50 shows a record&#8208;high 14.2 mmol/g BF3 uptake capacity. The BF3 uptake in HCOF&#8208;50 is reversible, leading to slow release of BF3. We leveraged this property to reduce the undesirable chain transfer and termination in the cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. Polymers with higher molecular weights and narrower polydispersity were generated compared to those synthesized using BF3&#8226;Et2O. The elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship, as provided by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, combined with the high BF3 uptake capacity and controlled sorption, highlights the molecular understanding of framework&#8208;guest interactions in addressing contemporary challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyanoacetates Enabled by Chiral Amide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamide and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amide are effective ligands for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl iodides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates, leading to the formation of &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;&#8208;alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Sites and Ligation in Amine&#8208;capped CdSe Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into devices for various applications is facilitated by designing and controlling their surface properties. One key strategy for tailoring surface properties is thus to choose tailored surface ligands. In that context, amines have been universally used, with the goal to improve NCs synthesis, processing and performances. However, understanding the nature of surface sites in amine&#8208;capped NCs remains challenging, due to the complex surface compositions as well as surface ligands dynamic. Here, we investigate both surface sites and amine ligation in CdSe NCs by combining advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational modelling. Notably, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced 113Cd and 77Se 1D NMR helps to identify both bulk and surface sites of NCs, while 113Cd 2D NMR spectroscopy enables to resolve amines terminated sites on both Se&#8208;rich and nonpolar surfaces. In addition to directly bonding to surface sites, amines are shown to also interact through hydrogen&#8208;bonding with absorbed water as revealed by 15N NMR, augmented with computations. The characterization methodology developed for this work provides unique molecular&#8208;level insight into the surface sites of a range of amine&#8208;capped CdSe NCs, and paves the way to identify structure&#8208;function relationships and rational approaches towards colloidal NCs with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals / &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Role of Hole Transport Pathway in Achieving Record High Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with mobile charges have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in photoelectric devices, chemical resistance sensors, and catalysis. However, fundamental understanding of the charge transport pathway within the framework and the key properties that determine the performance of conductive MOFs in photoelectric devices remain underexplored. Herein, we report the mechanisms of photoinduced charge transport and electron dynamics in the conductive 2D M&#8208;HHTP (M=Cu, Zn or Cu/Zn mixed; HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) MOFs and their correlation with photoconductivity using the combination of time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy, optical transient absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We identify the through&#8208;space hole transport mechanism through the interlayer sheet &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, where photoinduced hole state resides in HHTP ligand and electronic state is localized at the metal center. Moreover, the photoconductivity of the Cu&#8208;HHTP MOF is found to be 65.5 S&#8226;m&#8208;1, which represents the record high photoconductivity for porous MOF materials based on catecholate ligands.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with&#160;commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6]&#160;as catalyst.&#160;First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones.&#160;Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by&#160;an&#160;Evans&#8208;type&#160;oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was&#160;selected&#160;to remove the auxiliary&#160;to&#160;give&#160;enantioenriched&#160;b&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that&#160;the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene&#160;accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.</dc:description>

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8211;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx&#160;Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8208;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the&#160;rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8208;O coordination number&#8217;s role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx&#160;nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2&#160;using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in&#8208;situ EXAFS analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;accompanied by long durability (100 h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEMWE cell delivers a low voltage (1.72 V) at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2&#160;as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200 h (@1 A cm&#8208;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

Finally, the assembled PEMWE cell delivers a low voltage (1.72 V) at a current density of 1 A cm-2&#160;as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200 h (@1 A cm-2) without obvious decay.
