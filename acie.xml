         <title>A Fully Coplanar D&#8208;A Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge generation and separation have been regarded as the main constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein  , two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8208;CPs) with different linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs have been tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influences of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results unravel that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linking pattern, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern theoretically  helps to strengthen donor&#8208;acceptor interaction of PAE&#8208;CPs and generate the coplanar structure to facilitate the charge generation and separation, as well as red&#8208;shift light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8208;D with double&#8208;stranded linking pattern assumes a greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity than the single&#8208;stranded linking pattern analogue (PAE&#8208;S), facilitating the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cavity&#8208;Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Entraps Gases Selectively in Solution and the Amorphous Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn4L4 coordination cage enabled entrapment of gases in both solution and the amorphous solid state at atmospheric pressure. The lipophilic cavity of the cage was designed through a cavity&#8208;filling strategy, which could bind small hydrocarbon gases. A contrasting selectivity of gas capture was observed in solution and the solid state, showing the potential of the cage to be engineered as porous liquids or solid adsorbents for gas separation.







Abstract
Here we report the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of a truxene&#8208;faced Zn4L4 tetrahedron, which is capable of binding the smallest hydrocarbons in solution. By deliberately incorporating inward&#8208;facing ethyl groups on the truxene faces, the resulting partially&#8208;filled cage cavity was tailored to encapsulate methane, ethane, and ethene via van der Waals interactions at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile, and also in the amorphous solid state. Interestingly, gas capture showed divergent selectivities in solution and the amorphous solid state. The selective binding may prove useful in designing new processes for the purification of methane and ethane as feedstocks for chemical synthesis.

         <title>Magnetization Transfer to Enhance NOE Cross&#8208;Peaks among Labile Protons: Applications to Imino&#8211;Imino Sequential Walks in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Derived RNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to enhance the sensitivity of 2D NOESY correlations among labile protons is introduced and exemplified with experiments on RNA fragments derived from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome and with other samples. The approach leads to experiments that are ca. 10&#8208;fold faster and 3&#8208;fold more sensitive than conventional counterparts. The mechanism of this sensitivity boost is explained, and its strengths and limitations are analyzed.







Abstract
2D NOESY plays a central role in structural NMR spectroscopy. We have recently discussed methods that rely on solvent&#8208;driven exchanges to enhance NOE correlations between exchangeable and non&#8208;exchangeable protons in nucleic acids. Such methods, however, fail when trying to establish connectivities within pools of labile protons. This study introduces an alternative that also enhances NOEs between such labile sites, based on encoding a&#8197;priori selected peaks by selective saturations. The resulting selective magnetization transfer (SMT) experiment proves particularly useful for enhancing the imino&#8211;imino cross&#8208;peaks in RNAs, which is a first step in the NMR resolution of these structures. The origins of these enhancements are discussed, and their potential is demonstrated on RNA fragments derived from the genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, recorded with better sensitivity and an order of magnitude faster than conventional 2D counterparts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Esters by Cooperative Isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and effective catalytic enantioselective approach to &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters is demonstrated and applied to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic investigations support a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway with reversible isothiourea addition to an in&#8197;situ generated iminium ion leading to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters through enantioselective aminomethylation of an arylacetic acid ester in high yields and enantioselectivity via cooperative isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis is demonstrated. The scope and limitations of this process are explored (25 examples, up to 94&#8201;% yield and 96:4 er), with applications to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway being followed rather than an alternative dynamic kinetic resolution process. Control studies indicate that (i) a linear effect between catalyst and product er is observed; (ii) an acyl ammonium ion can be used as a precatalyst; (iii) reversible isothiourea addition to an in situ generated iminium ion leads to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.

         <title>Rules of Nucleophilic Additions to Zigzag Nanographene Diones**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unexpected selectivities of nucleophilic additions to zigzag nanographene diones, the authors explored and present the rules that govern these reactions. The Fukui function analysis shows a clear difference in reactivity of Kekul&#233; versus non&#8208;Kekul&#233; systems, where the former favor 1,2&#8208; and the latter 1,4&#8208;addition. The size of both the electrophile and the nucleophile may, however, alter the reaction outcome.







Abstract
Nucleophilic addition of carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to nanographene ketones represents a valuable late&#8208;stage method for the functionalization of zigzag nanographenes, but its use is rare in the chemical literature. Using two model systems, non&#8208;Kekul&#233; triangulene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione and Kekul&#233; anthanthrone, we identify unexpected regioselectivities and uncover the rules that govern these reactions. Considering the large number of nanographene ketones that have been reported since the pioneering work of Eric Clar, this method enables synthesis and exploration of hitherto unknown functionalized nanographenes.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Biomimetic Oxidation of Amines using a Hybrid Hydroquinone/Cobalt Catalyst as Electron Transfer Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines has been developed. The principle is based on biological oxidation in the respiratory chain in living organisms. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen occurs through coupled redox reactions, mediated by a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base as hybrid catalyst. This hybrid catalyst was found to significantly shield the iron catalyst from deactivation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first FeII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines. This oxidation reaction involves several electron transfer steps and is inspired by biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen is aided by two coupled catalytic redox systems, which lower the energy barrier and improve the selectivity of the oxidation reaction. An iron hydrogen transfer complex was utilized as the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst along with a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base complex as a hybrid electron transfer mediator. Various primary and secondary amines were oxidized in air to their corresponding aldimines or ketimines in good to excellent yield.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Performance PEO&#8208;based Ternary Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) allow improvement of the ionic conductivity of ternary PEO&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes. However, the lack of Li&#8208;ion coordination of these plasticizers and the addition of extra ions results in a low Li&#8208;ion conductivity. An oligo(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based IL was synthesized to overcome these limitation and enable additional transport modes, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates as non&#8208;flammable plasticizers for lowering the operation temperature of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but they present limitations in terms of lithium&#8208;ion transport, such as a much lower lithium transference number. Thus, a pyrrolidinium cation was prepared with an oligo(ethylene oxide) substituent with seven repeating units. We show, by a combination of experimental characterizations and simulations, that the cation's solvating properties allow faster lithium&#8208;ion transport than alkyl&#8208;substituted analogues when incorporated in SPEs. This proceeds not only by accelerating the conduction modes of PEO, but also by enabling new conduction modes linked to the solvation of lithium by a single IL cation. This, combined with favorable interfacial properties versus lithium metal, leads to significantly improved performance on lithium&#8208;metal polymer batteries.

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (  E  b  ) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small  E  b  of &#8208;0.11~0.15 eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak  E  b  in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.</dc:description>

Squeeze and react: a bio&#8208;inspired fluorescence color&#8208;switch probe uncovers that covalent Michael addition can generally occur inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color&#8208;switch probe mimicking the photo&#8208;conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620&#8197;nm) when it non&#8208;covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515&#8197;nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color&#8208;switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted Cation Adduction and Fragmentation of Small Metabolites</title>

Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is studied for cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites. This work establishes the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer, characterizes the loss of given groups during fragmentation, and enhances the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small&#8208;metabolite profiling as a tool of the future and calls for the comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)&#8208;MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders to establish the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in the analysis of large biomolecules, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.

Amino acids protected silver nanoclusters with Ag0 atoms [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208; valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208; isoleucine) have been synthesized for the first time. The Ag47 kernel consists of a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) and six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. They are superatoms with 1S21P61D10 configuration as revealed by DFT calculations. This work offers a facile method to obtain chiral nanoclusters by incorporating amino acids.







Abstract
Silver nanoclusters containing Ag0 atoms protected by amino acids were synthesized and characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208;valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208;isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC&#8801;CtBu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH4. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have T symmetry, and the Ag47 metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) surrounded with six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18&#8208;electron systems, suggesting they are superatomic clusters. The superatomic nature with a 1S21P61D10 configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare&#8208;Earth MOFs via ab&#8197;initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11514-11522, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks with DOBDC linkers. For the first time, spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker.







Abstract
Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Herein, an extensive set of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO2 without the presence of H2O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvating and Low&#8208;Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11442-11447, May 10, 2021. </description>

The introduction of cosolvents with non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) properties can intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ and regulate the solvation structures in electrolytes, which favors an upgraded anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potential in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). Herein, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively charged anion&#8211;cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent.

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra</title>

Soluble RhII&#8208;MOPs have been implemented in liquid&#8211;liquid extraction systems to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers. A steric hindrance&#8208;driven mechanism has been harnessed to selectively coordinate one regioisomer to the exohedral position of the dirhodium paddlewheel thus generating a solubility difference between the coordinated and the non&#8208;coordinated pyridine. This mechanism was elucidated through molecular dynamics and wet experiments.







Abstract
The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation&#8208;driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of RhII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh&#8208;MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non&#8208;bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid&#8211;liquid self&#8208;sorting systems. As a proof of concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially relevant compounds 2&#8208;chloropyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.

Chemical fueling enables complex self&#8208;replicating molecules to outcompete structurally simpler and faster replicators, revealing an important mechanism behind complexification that is required to transform chemistry into biology.







Abstract
Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible. Such complexification represents an important requirement for achieving open&#8208;ended evolution as it should allow improved and ultimately also new functions to emerge.

Previously, we showcased Z&#8208;selective Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides. In contrast, we describe herein the MBH&#8208;type rearrangement of aryl iodanes with the opposite stereoselectivity. Both protocols complement each other allowing for the synthesis of E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives on demand.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls represent an important class of derivatizable synthetic intermediates, however, the synthesis of such compounds still remains a challenge. Recently, we showcased a novel Z&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with aryl sulfoxides via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involving an Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) process. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible reaction pathway and provide an explanation for the opposite stereoselectivities.

         <title>Post&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly&#8208;Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11370-11377, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two supramolecular polymers (SPs) derived from the same porphyrin precursor has been achieved via cross&#8208;coupling. Metal&#8208;coordinated SPs were easily decorated at both edges with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl via Heck reaction, while self&#8208;assembled chiral SPs underwent enantioselective cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl to acquire homochiral functional units.







Abstract
Although post&#8208;functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post&#8208;functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;20&#8208;bromophenyl porphyrin (Br&#8208;TPyP) via cross&#8208;coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder&#8208;shaped, Cu&#8208;coordinated SPs preformed from Br&#8208;TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br&#8208;TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self&#8208;assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross&#8208;coupling reaction with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on&#8208;surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br&#8208;TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11318-11325, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart two&#8208;dimensional composite membranes containing flexible metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) and graphene oxide nanosheets are developed for pressure&#8208;responsive CO2 separations through a CO2&#8208;induced &#8220;gate opening&#8221; effect. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MONs, indicating a stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior with greatly enhanced CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
The regulation of permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (&#8776;100&#8197;nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.

         <title>pH Feedback Lifecycles Programmed by Enzymatic Logic Gates Using Common Foods as Fuels</title>

A tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate with delay orchestrates a temporal pH feedback system: the YES gate lifts the system to a promoted state in seconds, and the NAND gate embedded with either invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase chain drives it back to ground state with programmable lifetime. The system is very robust and able to use common foods as fuels.







Abstract
Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have made large progress. However, systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by enzymatic logic gates. They are realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15&#8197;min to more than 1&#8197;day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Operating with all&#8208;food grade chemicals and coupling to self&#8208;regulating hydrogel, our system is quite robust to work in a complicated medium with unknown components and in a biocompatible fashion.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>

The unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, nonlinear optical response, and incommensurate structural modulations in a new borosulfate LiRb4[B(SO4)4] brings new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.







Abstract
Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8722; super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.

         <title>Biosynthesis of 6&#8208;Hydroxymellein Requires a Collaborating Polyketide Synthase&#8208;like Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11423-11429, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new architecture for iterative Type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKS) from fungi has been investigated. TerA is a canonical non&#8208;reducing PKS which interacts with TerB, a fragment of a highly reducing PKS containing a functional ketoreductase. Interaction appears to be mediated between a non&#8208;functional dehydratase domain of TerB and the TerA product template domain. Working together, TerAB synthesises 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a precursor of terrein and other fungal metabolites.







Abstract
The polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;like protein TerB, consisting of inactive dehydratase, inactive C&#8208;methyltransferase, and functional ketoreductase domains collaborates with the iterative non reducing PKS TerA to produce 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a key pathway intermediate during the biosynthesis of various fungal natural products. The catalytically inactive dehydratase domain of TerB appears to mediate productive interactions with TerA, demonstrating a new mode of trans&#8208;interaction between iterative PKS components.

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs with Self&#8208;Toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and In&#8197;Situ Fragment Complexation</title>

A new paradigm of nanoprodrugs with a degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification design is introduced. Organic&#8208;modified hollow silica/Pd(OH)2 nanocomposites are constructed for pH&#8208;responsive biodegradation and subsequent in&#8197;situ complexation of the predesigned molecular fragments into cytotoxic complexes, thereby fulfilling effective cancer therapy by turning degradation by&#8208;products into therapeutics without using conventional chemodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrugs that allow in&#8197;situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using the nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)2 nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralizes protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd2+ and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in&#8197;situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.

         <title>Dense&#8208;Stacking Porous Conjugated Polymer as Reactive&#8208;Type Host for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11359-11369, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense&#8208;stacking hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) porous polymer is reported. The compact polymer/S cathode (ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) presents a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;% and high areal capacity (&gt;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The lithiation/delithiation of HATN polymer by Li2Sx facilitates the formation of intimately bound nanostructured Li2S/S on the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics.







Abstract
Commercialization of the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery is hampered by bottlenecks like low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, uncontrollable Li2Sx deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li2S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li2Sx and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1.

     alt="Dense&#8208;Stacking Porous Conjugated Polymer as Reactive&#8208;Type Host for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dense&#8208;stacking hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) porous polymer is reported. The compact polymer/S cathode (ca. 15&#8197;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) presents a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;% and high areal capacity (&amp;gt;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The lithiation/delithiation of HATN polymer by Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates the formation of intimately bound nanostructured Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S on the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercialization of the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery is hampered by bottlenecks like low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, uncontrollable Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The assembled pouch cell delivers a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 392&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Studies on the Lithiation, Borylation, and 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of O&#8208;Cycloalkyl 2,4,6&#8208;Triisopropylbenzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11436-11441, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;cycloalkyl benzoates were studied to understand their ability to undergo a lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction. Ring size was the key feature: too large and the system could not be lithiated; too small and the system could not undergo 1,2&#8208;migration. The cyclobutyl system occupies a &#8220;Goldilock's zone&#8221; where the lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction works well and shows broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3&#8208; &#8594; 6&#8208;membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation&#8208;borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Although all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent &#945;&#8208;elimination faster than deprotonation at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a &#8220;Goldilocks zone,&#8221; being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2&#8208;migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Diffraction Reveals a Hidden Novel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Electrocatalysis</title>

Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction can be used as a high&#8208;throughput technique for discovering new materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, especially when they are synthesized in a phase mixture.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF), denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO3&#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm&#8722;). With a composition of Zn3(mIm)5(OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of this new MOF and its conversion to an efficient electrocatalyst highlights the power of 3DED in developing new materials and their applications.

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Subcellular Protein Translocation Using a Photoactivatable Covalent Labeling System</title>

A photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) system based on covalent protein&#8208;labeling technologies was developed by rationally designing a new caged ligand. This photo&#8208;CID system enabled light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions such as the nucleus, mitochondrial outer membrane, and plasma membrane. Furthermore, quick protein translocation into a laser&#8208;illuminated subcellular microregion was achieved.







Abstract
The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) technique for tag&#8208;fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, light&#8208;induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein&#8208;labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL&#8208;tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant &#946;&#8208;lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL&#8208;tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo&#8208;CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser&#8208;illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo&#8208;CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.

         <title>Adapting and Remolding: Orchestrating Tumor Microenvironment Normalization with Photodynamic Therapy by Size Transformable Nanoframeworks</title>

We designed a core&#8208;satellite nanoframework (T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold tumor microenvironment (TME) via MMP2&#8208;triggered size transformation, TGF&#946; inhibition&#8208;mediated stroma remodeling and hemoglobin&#8208;enabled hypoxia relief. By coordinating TME normalization with photodynamic therapy (PDT), superior therapeutic outcomes could be gained in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.







Abstract
Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis and establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. We designed a core&#8208;satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;p&gt;We designed a core&#8208;satellite nanoframework (T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold tumor microenvironment (TME) via MMP2&#8208;triggered size transformation, TGF&#946; inhibition&#8208;mediated stroma remodeling and hemoglobin&#8208;enabled hypoxia relief. By coordinating TME normalization with photodynamic therapy (PDT), superior therapeutic outcomes could be gained in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Metallated Graphynes as a New Class of Photofunctional 2D Organometallic Nanosheets</title>

Bottom&#8208;up 2D metallated graphyne nanosheets exhibit their outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption properties and can be used as excellent saturable absorbers in the passively Q&#8208;switched Nd:YAG laser.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting much attention due to their excellent electronic and optical properties. Here, we report the first experimental preparation of two free&#8208;standing mercurated graphyne nanosheets via the interface&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method, which integrates both the advantages of metal center and graphyne. The continuous large&#8208;area nanosheets derived from the chemical growth show the layered molecular structural arrangement, controllable thickness and enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which result in their stable and outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption (SA) properties (at both 532 and 1064&#8197;nm). The passively Q&#8208;switched (PQS) performances of these two nanosheets as the saturable absorbers are comparable to or higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D nanomaterials (such as graphene, black phosphorus, MoS2, &#947;&#8208;graphyne, etc.). Our results illustrate that the two metallated graphynes could act not only as a new class of 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials, but also as inexpensive and easily available optoelectronic materials for device fabrication.

         <title>Less Unfavorable Salt Bridges on the Enzyme Surface Result in More Organic Cosolvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11448-11456, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By removing unfavorable surface salt bridges, the organic solvent and thermal resistance of enzymes can be significantly improved. This design strategy results in locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration.







Abstract
Biocatalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals is highly attractive but usually requires organic (co&#8208;)solvents (OSs). However, native enzymes often have low activity and resistance in OSs and at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a smart salt bridge design strategy for simultaneously improving OS resistance and thermostability of the model enzyme, Bacillus subtilits Lipase&#8197;A (BSLA). We combined comprehensive experimental studies of 3450 BSLA variants and molecular dynamics simulations of 36 systems. Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11494-11503, May 10, 2021. </description>

Glycoproteins on the surface of monocytes and macrophages were systematically quantified during the bacterial infection. The time&#8208;resolved analysis revealed transient changes and differential remodeling of these glycoproteins on both types of cells. Novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response were discovered, and site&#8208;specific glycosylation changes were identified.







Abstract
Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins during the immune response remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, and potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP, and site&#8208;specific changes of glycoproteins. This study provides unprecedented information to deepen our understanding of glycoproteins and cellular activities.

         <title>Liposomes as Carriers of Membrane&#8208;Associated Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11523-11530, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteoliposome carriers for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides enable the investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers, and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. This approach is versatile, applicable to many peripheral membrane proteins/peptides, and can be linked with functional assays.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.

Enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is demonstrated via CoII catalysis. Broad substrate scope is achieved, yielding chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. A CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes is posited whereby steric substrate ligand effects promote enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of di&#8208; and trisubstituted unsaturated acids with noble metals is well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. We demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids via cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes. DFT calculations reveal that enantioselectivity may originate from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.

A defect&#8208;repairing&#8208;induced dot&#8211;matrix distributed interface efficiently catalyzes electrolyte decomposition. This strategy enables an ultra&#8208;thin and robust solid&#8211;electrolyte interface achieving ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS2 nanoclusters (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS2/N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (&#8776;6.0&#8197;nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;92&#8201;%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO3CF3 and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS2/N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7&#8201;%, 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Especially, at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on a Porous Copper Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11487-11493, May 10, 2021. </description>

A porous Cu electrocatalyst showed long&#8208;term stability for over 240&#8197;h in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The mixed Cu0 and Cu+ oxidation state induced by the residual Cl and the porous sheet&#8208;like morphology were the key to the catalytic stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the emission of CO2 and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Herein, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst exhibits high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8&#8201;% at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240&#8197;h. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu0/Cu+ species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are critical to the high FE of C2+ in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine**
</title>

The Cryo&#8208;EM structure of human cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 in complex with quinidine reveals the molecular basis for pore blockade of Nav1.5 by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. An advanced and comprehensive structural understanding of the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs will facilitate drug discovery targeting Nav channels.







Abstract
Nav1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na+ (Nav) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Nav1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Nav1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive phenomena are widely observed in nature. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11318, Chongli Zhong, Dan Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report for pressure&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite membranes based on the gate&#8208;opening effect that CO2 molecules act as a &#8220;key&#8221; to open the MOF gates. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MOF, demonstrating a smart gas separation behavior.

A CpCo group was introduced in a cubic cage to generate a sphere&#8208;like force surface, thus dividing the cubic cage into two parts. Gas molecules have to pass the sphere&#8208;like force surface twice, which increases the interaction probability between gas and framework. Based on the high selectivity of the CpCo group, high&#8208;purity ethylene is obtained from an acetylene/ethylene/ethane ternary mixture, as reported by Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;11350.

Liposomes as carriers of proteins and peptides enable investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers and protein&#8211;lipid interactions in mass spectrometric analysis. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11523, Carla Schmidt et&#8197;al. show that proteoliposomes dissociate in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer, releasing associated proteins or peptides. This new approach shows that liposomes can be used to study proteins and peptides as well as their interactions with lipids.

         <title>The 2&#8208;Pyridyl Problem: Challenging Nucleophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Arylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11068-11091, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on methods developed as solutions for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridyl nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles. The topic encompasses traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes, modifications to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, as well as alternative nucleophilic reagents and recent developments in C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Azine&#8208;containing biaryls are ubiquitous scaffolds in many areas of chemistry, and efficient methods for their synthesis are continually desired. Pyridine rings are prominent amongst these motifs. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been widely used for their synthesis and functionalisation as they often provide a swift and tuneable route to related biaryl scaffolds. However, 2&#8208;pyridine organometallics are capricious coupling partners and 2&#8208;pyridyl boron reagents in particular are notorious for their instability and poor reactivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing biaryls is therefore limited, and methods for the formation of unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridines are scarce. This Review focuses on the methods developed for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridine nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles, and ranges from traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes to alternative nucleophilic reagents and novel main group approaches.

         <title>Strategies to Enable Reversible Magnesium Electrochemistry: From Electrolytes to Artificial Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11036-11047, May 10, 2021. </description>

This Minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
The first prototype of a rechargeable magnesium (Mg) battery demonstrated two decades ago sparked tremendous interest in the electrochemical community due to their potential low cost, high volumetric energy density. However, the development of rechargeable Mg batteries has been hampered by the incompatibility between the Mg&#8208;metal anode and conventional carbonate electrolytes. Research has focused on electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable against reduction at the expense of low oxidation potential at the cathode side. Alternatively, the use of an artificial solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via surface coating presents promising results to address the Mg/electrolyte incompatibility and significantly broaden the selection of electrolytes. This minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.

Bimetallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been applied as sacrificial templates or precursors in the preparation of derivatives that can be used in supercapacitors. Bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives can offer the advantages of improved electrochemical activity, convenient redox reactions, and high electrical conductivity, and are excellent candidates as advanced electrode materials.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs), showing excellent power density, long service life, and high reversibility, have received great attention because of the increasing demand for energy storage devices. To further improve their performance, it is essential to develop advanced electrode materials. One group of materials, porous crystalline solids referred to as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have proved to be excellent templates for synthesizing functional materials to be employed in the preparation of electrodes for SCs. In comparison to monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives offer a number of advantages, including tunable electrochemical activity, high charge capacity, and improved electrical conductivity. This review focuses on the use of MOF&#8208;derived bimetallic materials in SCs, the origin of the improved performance, and the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives in this research area are discussed.

         <title>Precision Conjugation: An Emerging Tool for Generating Protein&#8211;Polymer Conjugates</title>

Precision conjugation to resolve the nonspecificity and low&#8208;efficiency problems associated with traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques such as PEGylation is the focus of this Minireview. Site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth (SIG) and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion (IPF) are discussed as two representative grafting&#8208;from methods for the development of next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are increasingly being applied in biomedicine because of the unique combination of the biological activity of the proteins and the multifunctionality and flexibility of the polymers. However, traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques suffer from some unavoidable drawbacks, including nonspecificity and low efficiency. In this Minireview, we discuss a new approach based on &#8220;precision conjugation&#8221; for the construction of the next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates in a more controlled, more efficient, and tailorable fashion for a broad range of advanced applications. In illustrating the concept, we highlight two general methods: site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion, with a focus on the in&#8197;situ, efficient, and controllable formation of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates. At the end, the challenges associated with this emerging concept are further discussed.

         <title>Conjugated Copolymers That Shouldn't Be</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11115-11119, May 10, 2021. </description>

Unexpected excited&#8208;state conjugation was observed in a series of copolymers derived from ladder silsesquioxane, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, which exhibited 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted emission relative to double&#8208;decker derived analogues with equal or larger degrees of polymerization. Further studies hint at their potential application as semiconducting polymers.







Abstract
Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well&#8208;defined structures and physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we report unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O0.5)2][PhSiO1.5]8[(O0.5)2Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red&#8208;shifts relative to model compounds, implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O&#8208;)2 siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation, we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm emission red&#8208;shifts beyond those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs despite lacking a true cage. Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene, and thienothiophene with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% F4TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>An Efficient Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11190-11195, May 10, 2021. </description>

2D Ni metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) with controlled coordination mode were carefully created through a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis strategy for the first time and adopted as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. The optimized partially unsaturated Ni MOF NSs&#8208;6 exhibits near&#8208;zero overpotential as well as ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, exceeding most electrocatalysts up to date.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation is ultrasonication or solvothermal. Herein, a liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the efficient fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. The active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (RM/L). The Ni MOF NSs display highly RM/L dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where the Ni MOF NSs with the RM/L of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity and production rate of ca. 80&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. As evidenced by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.

         <title>Drop&#8208;Casting to Make Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells under High Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11242-11246, May 10, 2021. </description>

MAPbI3 crystal growth in the films made by drop&#8208;casting is regulated by changing the temperature. At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI3 films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI3 films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity.

&lt;p&gt;MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal growth in the films made by drop&#8208;casting is regulated by changing the temperature. At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&amp;gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &amp;gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer driven valence tautomerism and redox noninnocence of unexplored azobis(benzothiazole) on coordination to {Ru(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedianato) have been illustrated in the context of designing reversible electron reservoir system for the potential application in catalysis and material science.







Abstract
The impact of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {RuII(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedionato). It led to the authentication of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes incorporating variable oxidation states of abbt (abbt0/.&#8722;/2&#8722;). Mononuclear 1 was identified as [RuIII(abbt.&#8722;)], a MLCT excited state of [RuII(abbt)]. Dinuclear 2 was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed&#8208;valent meso&#8208;[Ru2.5(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;)Ru2.5] (2a) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso&#8208;[RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt2&#8722;)RuIII] (2b), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo&#8208;based ligand systems. A crystal structure of [2]ClO4 validated the formation of [RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;) RuIII]ClO4. Analysis of electronic structural forms of 1 and 2 in accessible redox states via spectroelectrochemistry and DFT revealed their electron reservoir feature.

         <title>Selective Crystallization of Rare&#8208;Earth Ions into Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Rare&#8208;Earth Separation</title>

A family of 6&#8208;connected trimer&#8208;based MOFs with 6&#8208;coordinated metals has been developed from rare&#8208;earth elements. A confluence of factors have been identified to lead to such unusual low&#8208;coordinate rare&#8208;earth MOFs that prove to be a powerful platform enabling dramatically enhanced efficiency for rare&#8208;earth separation.







Abstract
For rare&#8208;earth separation, selective crystallization into metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM&#8208;66) with low&#8208;coordination&#8208;number environment for rare&#8208;earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare&#8208;earth ions and shows exceptional ion&#8208;size selectivity during crystallization. CPM&#8208;66 family are based on M3O trimers (M=6&#8208;coordinated Sc, In, Er&#8208;Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea&#8208;type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.

An approach to selectively transform C&#947;&#8722;H bonds of alicyclic amines to C&#947;(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds is described. This method is enabled via the pre&#8208;complexation of the amine substrate with palladium followed by the addition of oxidant to yield bioactive motifs functionalized at the &#947;&#8208;position.







Abstract
This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C&#947;&#8722;H versus C&#945;&#8722;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8208;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Induced Surface Metallization for Ammonia Synthesis under Photoexcitation up to 1550&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11173-11179, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x was achieved through the bonding between surface terminal Ti&#8208;F groups and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2 with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting superior photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region.







Abstract
The first observation of surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x induced by fluoride ions is presented. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F&#8722; and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2&#8722;x with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8211;1550&#8197;nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H2 and N2 by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.

The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and adjacent Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The metalized TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8211;1550&#8197;nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Specific Pro&#8208;amplifier of Reactive Oxygen Species in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11158-11162, May 10, 2021. </description>

A fluorogenic N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrug activated by reactive oxygen species in vitro and in vivo was developed that is cancer cell specific and targets the endoplasmic reticulum.







Abstract
The folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells, leading to so&#8208;called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading, for example, to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this problem, we have developed ER&#8208;targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy, and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential, and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) murine model.

         <title>Triarylmethanes and their Medium&#8208;Ring Analogues by Unactivated Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement of Benzanilides</title>

A conformationally accelerated intramolecular arylation provides an operationally simple way to prepare triarylmethanes and their medium&#8208;ring analogues. In&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy and a Hammett plot revealed mechanistic details of the electronically unactivated SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement) of the anions of 2&#8208;benzyl benzanilides leads to triarylmethanes in an operationally simple manner. The reaction succeeds even without electronic activation of the ring that plays the role of electrophile in the SNAr reaction, being accelerated instead by the preferred conformation imposed by the tertiary amide tether. The amide substituent of the product may be removed or transformed into alternative functional groups. A ring&#8208;expanding variant (n&#8197;to n+4) of the reaction provided a route to doubly benzo&#8208;fused medium ring lactams of 10 or 11&#8197;members. Hammett analysis returned a &#961;&#8197;value consistent with the operation of a partially concerted reaction mechanism.

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11288-11293, May 10, 2021. </description>

Two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. Macrocycles WQP3 and WQP4 could strongly complex with an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG). Host&#8211;guest complexation served to not only efficiently decrease the PXG's hemolysis in rabbit red blood cells, but also substantially enhance its metabolic stability in presence of proteinase&#8197;K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.







Abstract
Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (Ka) of (4.20&#177;0.23)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46&#177;0.44)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8211;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.

         <title>Improving Bioavailability of Hydrophobic Prodrugs through Supramolecular Nanocarriers Based on Recombinant Proteins for Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11252-11256, May 10, 2021. </description>

A new generation of protein&#8208;based nanodrugs was developed driven by supramolecular assembly. The nanodrug exhibited significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma models, allowing long&#8208;acting osteosarcoma treatment. Side effects including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis were greatly mitigated with this medication.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanodrug assembly driven by supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulations is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein&#8208;based nanodrug carriers, which is very efficient for loading and delivering the hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. The half&#8208;life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability increased by 17&#8208;fold. This is significantly superior to other drug counterparts, empowering long&#8208;acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off&#8208;target side effects of the prodrug, including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis, were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy enables the customized design of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.

Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of PH3 and the reaction of PH3 with H2O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni2P.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH3 and Pn+ species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH3 was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH3 and Pn+ during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH3 and Pn+. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni2P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>

Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>Biogenesis&#8208;Guided Synthesis and Structural Revision of Sarocladione Enabled by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Endoperoxide Fragmentation</title>

By studying sarocladione biosynthesis, we accomplished its chemical synthesis from ergosterol in two or seven steps and revised the published structure of this compound, which is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid isolated from a natural source. This work was enabled by development of a general method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by dual C&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
Sarocladione is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid with a 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diketone framework to have been isolated from a natural source. Herein we report a biomimetic synthesis of sarocladione in only two or seven steps from inexpensive, commercially available ergosterol. The key feature of this synthesis was a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed various saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by cleavage of two C&#8722;C bonds. This synthesis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structure of sarocladione and provided experimental support for its revised biosynthetic origin. This work also vividly demonstrates that consideration of the biogenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating the structures of natural products.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Probe for Enzyme Active&#8208;Site Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11143-11147, May 10, 2021. </description>

A genetically encoded two&#8208;dimensional infrared probe, N3Y, was developed for monitoring femtosecond to picosecond water dynamics and conformational flexibility of enzyme active sites. The addition of a low concentration of desaturating reagent decreased active&#8208;site water motion confinement, which is correlated with a decrease in enzyme activity.







Abstract
While two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active&#8208;site dynamics is limited due to the lack of site&#8208;specific 2D&#8208;IR probes. We demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D&#8208;IR probe, m&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine (N3Y) in the active&#8208;site of DddK, an iron&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active&#8208;site iron to FeIII, and the addition of denaturation reagents, result in significant decrease in enzyme activity and active&#8208;site water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles, including as general acids and bases, and electron transfer agents in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D&#8208;IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active&#8208;site motions at the fs&#8211;ps time scale direct reaction pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.

         <title>A Simple Biomimetic Receptor Selectively Recognizing the GlcNAc2 Disaccharide in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11168-11172, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think simple. In the development of biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, an approach that focuses on simple acyclic architectures can be successfully exploited for disaccharide recognition, provided that the correct binding geometry can be achieved. Here we present a simple tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor that selectively recognizes in water GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, such as coronaviruses.







Abstract
GlcNAc2 is the core disaccharide fragment present in N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses of high health concern, such as coronaviruses. Because N&#8208;glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc2 by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein, we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycoside of GlcNAc2 in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160&#8197;&#956;M, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers&#8208;shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono&#8208; and disaccharides. Molecular modelling calculations supported by NOE data provided a three&#8208;dimensional description of the binding mode, shedding light on the origin of the affinities and selectivities exhibited by the receptor.

A novel Au67(SCH2Ph)35 nanocluster was synthesized and its structure unravelled, which is the first one resolved by SCXC for thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the size range from Au61 to Au91. Au67(SCH2Ph)35 can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film, which exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a SERS substrate for sensing malachite green, methylene blue and Sudan III.







Abstract
Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium&#8208;sized range by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix&#8208;structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate&#8208;universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11120-11126, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is a fundamental scientific question. We show that dissolution behavior of racemic and enantiopure amines can be altered by conversion into phosphoramidates. Stirring a solid scalemic mixture in water leads to enantioenrichment of the solution phase (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). Amplification of amino acids and their derivatives show that phosphorylation can serve as a potentially viable source of prebiotic homochirality.







Abstract
The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature's essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation&#8208;based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine&#8208;based phosphoramidates, ee's of up to 95&#8201;% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en&#8208;route to prebiotic homochirality.

Trimethylsilylium abstraction from a cobalt nitrilimide complex generates a transient cobalt diazomethanediide complex, which forms a terminal isocyanoamido ligand through a radical de&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Lithium trimethylsilyldiazomethanide and a cobalt (II) precursor with an N&#8208;anchored tris&#8208;NHC (TIMENmes) ligand provide access to the cobalt nitrilimide 1. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry (SC&#8208;XRD) and its electronic structure was examined in detail, including EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analyses. The desilylation of the C&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)nitrilimide reveals a transient complex with an elusive diazomethanediide ligand, which substitutes one of the mesitylene rings of the ancillary ligand through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. This transformation results in the cyclometalated cobalt(II) complex 2, featuring a rare isocyanoamido&#8208;&#954;&#8208;C ligand.

Desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B (dmXeB) is a complex marine natural product that exhibits unique properties as a modulator of calcium signaling with downstream effects on cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism. We report a scalable total synthesis of dmXe&#8201;B by a flexible synthetic strategy that allows for control of oxidation levels and stereochemistry at C9/9&#8242;.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of the oxaquinolizidine marine natural product desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B is based on the early application of Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement, macrolactamization, and a late&#8208;stage installation of the oxaquinolizidine units by lactam reduction. The synthesis serves as the source of material to investigate calcium signaling and its effect on mitochondrial metabolism in various cell types, including cancer cells.

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11300-11304, May 10, 2021. </description>

Incorporation of two fully unsaturated pentagons to the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) core gives access to two dicyclopentaannelated HBC regioisomers: mPHBC and pPHBC. Both compounds show decreased energy gaps compared with the parent HBC and exhibit singlet biradical ground state with prominent biradical character.







Abstract
Synthesis of two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers was carried out, using nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be generated and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC &#960;&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.

Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.72 and 0.96 for &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;PHBC &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;PHBC &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC &#960;&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.&lt;/p&gt;

The first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles is reported. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
The development of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions has gained much progress in recent years, however, no successful example with phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles has yet been reported until now. Herein, we report the first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.

         <title>A General Supramolecular Approach to Regulate Protein Functions by Cucurbit[7]uril and Unnatural Amino Acid Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11196-11200, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal supramolecular host&#8211;guest recognition strategy was developed for reversible regulation of protein function at the single residue level. A guest molecule that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril was genetically encoded into proteins. Reversible regulation of enzyme function and cell activity was achieved when this strategy was applied to two enzymes and a cytokine.







Abstract
Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. We report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.

         <title>Bioinspired Synergistic Photochromic Luminescence and Programmable Liquid Crystal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11247-11251, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergic allochroic and shape&#8208;morphing bio&#8208;functions like caterpillars and cephalopods, photochromic luminescent liquid crystal actuators were prepared. Complex movements and fluorescent colors can be synergically manipulated by light based on the phase transition of liquid crystals and photoresponse of the fluorescent chromophores after the actuators were programmed with hybrid mesogenic alignments.







Abstract
Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability that can be manipulated in situ with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio&#8208;mimic functions and light&#8208;induced auxetic metamaterial&#8208;like devices were shown to be feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami&#8208;programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities provide an elegant strategy to design multi&#8208;functional liquid crystal actuators.

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Behind the Roughness&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11133-11137, May 10, 2021. </description>

The mechanism behind the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide is revealed by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for the reaction on catalysts with different roughness factors (RF). Ways to enhance the reaction selectivity are predicated.







Abstract
High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.

The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional regioselective reactions.

Abstract
The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11267-11271, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific aptamer chimeras were designed and constructed for lysosomal degradation of targeted membrane&#8208;associated proteins (see picture). The method provides a powerful and potentially universal platform for the use of inexpensive and readily synthesized aptamer materials for the clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular medicine.







Abstract
The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we describe a platform for the targeted degradation of membrane&#8208;associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane&#8208;bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK&#8208;7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for the use of readily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and potential therapeutics.

         <title>Alkylidene Meldrum's Acids as Platforms for the Vinylogous Synthesis of Dihydropyranones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11110-11114, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disubstituted alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be novel C4&#8208;synthons capable of undergoing a vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with reactive ketones, providing an unprecedented route to chiral 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones under Br&#248;nsted base organocatalytic conditions.







Abstract
Upon Br&#248;nsted base organocatalysis, ketone&#8208;derived alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be competent vinylogous platforms able to undergo a formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;furandione, providing an unprecedented route to 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones as spiro[4.5]decane derivatives with up to 98&#8201;% ee thanks to the commercially available Takemoto catalyst. Preliminary investigation showed that this reaction could be extended to other activated ketones, establishing these alkylidene Meldrum's acids as a novel C4&#8208;synthon in the vinylogous series.

         <title>Chemical Reduction of a Nanosized [6]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene Macrocycle</title>

Macrocycle &#960;&#8208;conjugation: The two&#8208;fold reduction of [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP) with Li and K metals affords the doubly reduced macrocycle with a large 62&#960; conjugated system, enhanced aromaticity, and variable metal complexation patterns.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP, 1), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly&#8208;reduced state of 1. The macrocyclic 12&#8722; anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the formation of contact&#8208;ion complexes with one Li+ and two K+ ions in THF, and a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion in the solvent&#8208;separated ion product with K+ ions in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The detailed structural analysis of 12&#8722; showed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the biaryl linkages between naphthylene panels were enhanced upon two&#8208;fold reduction, which was rationally explained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Giant Heterometallic Polyoxotungstate Supercluster with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11153-11157, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical assembly of a giant heterometallic polyoxotungstate supercluster with a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa is reported. Geometrically unrestricted cerium(III) and geometrically restricted dimethyl tin cation linkers are used to gain access to a giant molecular species featuring three different polyoxometalate building units. The compound demonstrates in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. We demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, that is, organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH3)2)2O]4{[CeW5O18] [TeW4O16][CeSn(CH3)2]4[TeW8O31]4}2}46&#8722; (1&#8201;a) features dimensions of ca. 2.2&#215;2.3&#215;3.4&#8197;nm3 and a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa. Structural analysis shows the hierarchical aggregation from several independent subunits. Initial biomedical tests show that 1 features an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells based on an apoptosis pathway. In&#8197;vivo experiments in mice reveal the antiproliferative activity of 1 and open new paths for further development of this new compound class.

Both right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers were successfully synthesized through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne benzannulations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing optically&#8208;active 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane units as a spiro&#8208;type chiral linkage in the main chain that relies on the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents introduced to the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[a,h]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization. This strategy is applicable to the defect&#8208;free precise synthesis of other varieties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and coplanar ladder polymers that have not been achieved before.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Reagent&#8208;Free Formal Aza&#8208;Wacker Cyclizations Enabled by Continuous&#8208;Flow Electrochemistry</title>

A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical aza&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type cyclization reaction that is free of catalyst, oxidant, supporting electrolyte, and additives is presented. The method is scalable and compatible with di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable methods to access saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is of great importance because of the prevalence of these structures in natural products and bioactive compounds. Pd&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization is a powerful method and provides access to N&#8208;heterocycles bearing an alkene moiety available for further synthetic manipulations from readily available materials. Herein we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free formal aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization reaction for the synthesis of functionalized saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Key to the success is to conduct the reactions in a continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical reactor without adding supporting electrolyte or additives. The reactions are characterized by broad tolerance of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Coated Organic Crystals with Solvent&#8208;Resistant Capacity and Optical Waveguiding Function</title>

Organic crystals with polymer composite coatings which involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (PDDA/PSS)9 polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and a succeeding PVA layer are reported. The PVA&#8208;(PDDA/PSS)9&#8208;coated single crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in a variety of organic solvents without being damaged and as optical waveguides are as efficient as the uncoated crystals.







Abstract
Recently, luminescent organic crystals have been widely studied as new optoelectronic materials. However, corrosion and dissolution of organic crystals by solvents have always been a great challenge for the application of organic crystals in various fields. In this work, we propose a general method of fabricating a solvent&#8208;resistant coating to prevent organic crystals from being corroded or dissolved by organic solvents. The coatings involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) onto crystals, followed by immersing the coated crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions for 2&#8197;minutes. The coated crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in common organic solvents without being damaged and even insoluble in dichloromethane for 5&#8197;days. Moreover, the thin and transparent coatings have little effect on the optical properties of crystals which still have excellent optical waveguide performance with the coatings.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Bound Isolated Dimers in the Gas Phase: Observation of the Shortest Intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Distance via Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Head&#8208;on Collision: Isolated gas phase triphenylmethane based dimers containing dispersion energy donors form a head&#8208;to&#8208;head structure with an extremely short C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C distance with a collinear arrangement of atoms. This surprising result from molecular beam experiments indicates that it is London dispersion but not crystal packing, responsible for this peculiar structural arrangement.







Abstract
The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (T&#8201;tBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8722;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8722;D&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;D&#8722;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Sized Siloxene Nanosheets as Bifunctional Photocatalyst for a Li&#8208;O2 Battery with Superior Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency and Extra&#8208;Long Durability</title>

Ultra&#8208;large sized and few layered siloxene nanosheets have been used as a bifunctional photocatalyst in a Li&#8208;O2 battery. Due to its superior photoelectric characters, the assembled photo&#8208;assisted battery has exhibited a breakthrough round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O2 batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra&#8208;large sized and few layered siloxene nanosheets have been used as a bifunctional photocatalyst in a Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. Due to its superior photoelectric characters, the assembled photo&#8208;assisted battery has exhibited a breakthrough round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11098-11103, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

We report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae.







Abstract
Protein coronae formed with nanoparticles confer several useful properties. However, the non&#8208;specific nature of protein corona formation makes it difficult to deliver specific proteins for therapeutic applications. Herein, we report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae. We show the design and delivery of the ribonucleoprotein corona for the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Successful gene editing in human cell lines (Hela and HEK293) demonstrates the efficient delivery, high stability, low cytotoxicity, and well&#8208;controlled activity of the Cas9&#8208;guide RNA ribonucleoprotein. The binding&#8208;mediated protein corona strategy opens up new opportunities for therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Dynamic Protease Activation on a Multimeric Synthetic Protein Scaffold via Adaptable DNA&#8208;Based Recruitment Domains</title>

A hexameric protein recruitment platform allows controlled assembly and activation of caspase&#8208;9 enzymes using short DNA sequences as modular recruitment domains. Simple molecular tuning of the DNA recruitment domains enables reversible switching or kinetic inhibition of the proximity&#8208;induced enzyme activation.







Abstract
Hexameric hemoprotein (HTHP) is employed as a scaffold protein for the supramolecular assembly and activation of the apoptotic signalling enzyme caspase&#8208;9, using short DNA elements as modular recruitment domains. Caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activation on the HTHP platform due to enhanced proximity is followed by combinatorial inhibition at high scaffold concentrations. The DNA recruitment domains allow for reversible switching of the caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activity state using short modulatory DNA strands. Tuning of the recruitment domain affinity allows for generating kinetically trapped active enzyme complexes, as well as for dynamic repositioning of caspases over scaffold populations and inhibition using monovalent sink platforms. The conceptual combination of a highly structured multivalent protein platform with modular DNA recruitment domains provides emergent biomimicry properties with advanced levels of control over protein assembly.

The joint application of experimental and computational approaches discloses unprecedented mechanistic intricacies associated to Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions when using nucleophilic coupling partners. The use of trifluoromethylthiolation reveals an exceptional reductive elimination event from high&#8208;valent Cp*CoIV that can be promoted by either chemical oxidants or electrochemical methods.







Abstract
The potential access to CoIV species for promoting transformations that are particularly challenging at CoIII still remains underexploited in the context of Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herein, we disclose a combined experimental and computational strategy for uncovering the participation of Cp*CoIV species in a Cp*Co&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond&#8208;reductive elimination. These studies support the intermediacy of high&#8208;valent Cp*Co species in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, under oxidative conditions, when involving nucleophilic coupling partners.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Cyclohepta[b]indoles by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type Reactions</title>

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoredox [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction was developed for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles, which is initiated by a novel process of single&#8208;electron transfer from the enaminone moiety.







Abstract
A novel method for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles in high yields was developed. The method involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, photocatalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/ retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction of enaminones. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the reaction is a photoredox process initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation of an enaminone moiety, which undergoes subsequent cyclobutane formation and rapidly fragmentation in a radical&#8208;cation state to form cyclohepta[b]indoles.

The electrophotocatalytic C&#8722;H heterofunctionalization of arenes with high chemoselectivity under both batch and flow conditions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrophotocatalytic heterofunctionalization of arenes is described. Using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyanoquinone (DDQ) under a mild electrochemical potential with visible&#8208;light irradiation, arenes undergo oxidant&#8208;free hydroxylation, alkoxylation, and amination with high chemoselectivity. In addition to batch reactions, an electrophotocatalytic recirculating flow process is demonstrated, enabling the conversion of benzene to phenol on a gram scale.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarker in vivo and in situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward HCC&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in vivo and in situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. In vivo signals of probe correlating well with tumor apoptosis make it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. Excellent property of probe enables the first imaging of CE activity in situ with high resolution three&#8208;dimensional view. This study may promote advancements in optical imaging approach for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in situ and its evaluation of treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Stacked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dendrimers for Highly Efficient White Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8208;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9 lm W  &#8208;1  , representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100 %) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722;: Solving the Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifaceted bond: High level Valence Bond calculations show that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is stabilized neither by a dative bond nor by a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond, but rather by a unique combination of three distinct components that are accurately quantified.







Abstract
Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8722;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.

A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)], AgSbF6, and NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (A), a coinage metal salt AgSbF6, and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) yield 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers. The seven&#8208;membered backbone of the dinitrile was experimentally found as the borderline for the self&#8208;assembly system furnishing products of different kinds. At x&lt;7, various rather simple polymers are exclusively formed possessing either 0D or 1D Ag/A structural motifs connected by dinitrile spacers, while at x&#8805;7, the self&#8208;assembly switches to unprecedented extraordinary 3D&#8197;networks of nano&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest assemblies (SbF6)@[(A)9Ag11]11+ (x=7) or (A)@[(A)12Ag12]12+ (x=8&#8211;10) linked by dinitriles. The polycationic nodes represent the first superspheres based on A and silver and are host&#8211;guest able. All products are characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The assemblies [(A)12Ag12]12+ were visualized by transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>Recombinant Spider Silk Gels Derived from Aqueous&#8211;Organic Solvents as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from the fact that spider silk hydrogels can serve as drug depots for water&#8208;soluble drugs, recombinant spider silk proteins can also assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich structures in aqueous&#8211;organic binary systems. The organic&#8208;phase content of these non&#8208;toxic, biocompatible gels allows the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs for various applications.







Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. Herein, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8211;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplarily shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve, for example, as drug depots, and they could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.

         <title>Massive Pressure Amplification by Stimulated Contraction of Mesoporous Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative Gas Adsorption is a unique counterintuitive phenomenon of responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks hitherto only observed below atmospheric pressure. Carbon dioxide stimulates contraction at high absolute pressure inducing massive pressure amplification exceeding 500&#8197;kPa.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate mesoporous frameworks interacting with carbon dioxide leading to stimulated structural contractions and massive out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pressure amplification well beyond ambient pressure. Carbon dioxide, a non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable working medium, is promising for the development of pressure&#8208;amplifying frameworks for pneumatic technologies and safety systems. The strong interaction of the fluid with the framework even contracts DUT&#8208;46, a framework hitherto considered as non&#8208;flexible. Synchrotron&#8208;based in&#8197;situ PXRD/adsorption experiments reveal the characteristic contraction pressure for DUT&#8208;49 pressure amplification in the range of 350&#8211;680&#8197;kPa. The stimulated framework contraction expels 1.1 to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO2 leading to autonomous pressure amplification in a pneumatic demonstrator system up to 428&#8197;kPa. According to system level estimations even higher theoretical pressure amplification may be achieved between 535 and 1011&#8197;kPa.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Emission from Off&#8208;Gases of Steel Industry by Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of a novel process is presented for the reduction of CO2 emissions occurring in the steel industry. The potential of using off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace for the dry reforming of the CH4 to valuable syngas is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% was achieved at conditions relevant for the steel industry.







Abstract
In a novel process, CO2 and CH4 from the off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those greenhouse gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% could be achieved at 1350&#8201;&#176;C, 5.5&#8197;bar, and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary&#8208;step reaction mechanism.

         <title>Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of neutral coinage&#8208;metal boryl complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The compounds are isoelectronic with alkene complexes, which are crucial intermediates in catalysis. Both the strength of binding and the propensity for deviation toward &#951;1 coordination are more favourable for Au over Ag and Cu.







Abstract
A series of linear late transition metal (M=Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]&#8722; moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;2 and &#951;1 coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]&#8722; ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.

Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Using the Mechanical Bond to Tune the Performance of a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rotaxanes containing a carbazole&#8208;containing TADF luminophore in which the mechanical bond improves key photophysical properties, including the photoluminescence quantum yield and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest this is due to weak interactions between the axle and macrocycle, enforced by the mechanical bond.







Abstract
We report the characterization of rotaxanes based on a carbazole&#8208;benzophenone thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminophore. We find that the mechanical bond leads to an improvement in key photophysical properties of the emitter, notably an increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and a decrease in the energy difference between singlet and triplet states, as well as fine tuning of the emission wavelength, a feat that is difficult to achieve when using covalently bound substituents. Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest that this tuning of properties occurs due to weak interactions between the axle and the macrocycle that are enforced by the mechanical bond. This work highlights the benefits of using the mechanical bond to refine existing luminophores, providing a new avenue for emitter optimization that can ultimately increase the performance of these molecules.

         <title>New Aldehyde&#8208;Functional Methacrylic Water&#8208;Soluble Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer (AGEO5MA) was prepared by oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT aqueous polymerization yielded PAGEO5MA homopolymer, which was oxidized using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios to yield hydrophilic statistical copolymers with cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups. Three PGEO5MA&#8208;based diblock copolymers were converted into aldehyde&#8208;functional copolymers, which were derivatized with amino acids.







Abstract
Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional vinyl monomers. We report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic cis&#8208;diol&#8208;based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water&#8208;soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal cis&#8208;diol units on PGEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C affords a water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups was prepared using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer were reacted in turn with three amino acids to demonstrate synthetic utility.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning&#160;of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of multi&#8208;chiral helicates with self&#8208;amplifying enantioselectivity. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded Zn  II  2  L  3  complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and Zn(II). Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted multi&#8208;chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global multi&#8208;chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates their chiral discriminations are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling catenation in Ge(I) chemistry through hemi&#8208;lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach for constructing chains of group 14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8208;metal bonds that exploits hemi&#8208;labile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) 'protecting groups' and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH&#173;&#173;2)2C6H&#173;3) &#8208; featuring hemi&#8208;labile NiPr2&#160;donors &#8208; yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4&#160;(2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4&#160;chain.&#160;2&#160;is the first example of a linear homo&#8208;catenated Ge(I) compound featuring unsupported E&#8210;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4&#160;and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2&#160;&#160;(4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2&#160;(5), respectively.&#160;The use of smaller&#160;N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8210;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2&#160;dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated Ge(I) centres.</dc:description>

         <title>Low dimensional inorganic tin perovskite solar cells by a template growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x  with mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. Kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2  and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x. The film shows out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability and oxidation resistance. Solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8208;x  perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air. Low&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure provides a route for the development of high efficiency and stable tin halide perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress due to the recent advances of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 14%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still severely restricted by the lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption spectrum, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. Herein, a multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, namely PFY&#8208;3Se, based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer was designed and developed. Compared to its thiophene analog PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se possesses a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption (~30 nm), increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular aggregation and packing. When matched with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs field reported so far and much better than those of thiophene analogs (PCE=13.0%). More importantly, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties which is very helpful for realizing reproducible device performance. This is the first reported and also is very rare for the PSMAs so far which provides a potential candidate for efficient all&#8208;PSCs toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self&#8208;assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.







Abstract
Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.

         <title>(2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium: A Hexane&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Br/Na&#8208;Exchanges and Directed Metalations in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generation of sodium metal free, hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor in a continuous flow set&#8208;up was reported. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium proved to be a very useful sodium organometallic reagent and was used for in&#8208;line sodiations as well as Br/Na&#8208;exchange reactions. The arylsodiums were trapped with various electrophiles. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was reported.







Abstract
We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (1) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (2) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of 1 is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (1) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500 cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8 V at 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10oC. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A modular in vitro platform for the production of terpenes and polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO  2  as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharma&#173;ceuticals, fragrances and food&#8208;additives. Here we developed a modular  in vitro  platform for the continuous conversion of CO  2  into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO  2  into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational control of chemical reactivity for surface&#8208;confined Ru&#8208;porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing waves measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature programmed desorption the binding strength. Density functional theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyze a vast variety of reactions rendering the regulation of their activity a key method to control biological function. In this work, we report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis. Firstly, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin inhibiting its catalytic activity. With both ultrasound generating inertial cavitation (20 kHz) and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound (5 MHz), the specific interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved restoring the activity of thrombin to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Secondly, we expanded this approach to split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. Notably, the latter process is reversible and can be induced multiple times without apparent fatigue. We envision that this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach to regulate the activity of aptamer&#8208;guarded enzymes by ultrasound will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli and open further avenues in sonogenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  2  I  18  (solv)] (  1  ) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI  3  ]  2  or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  9+  network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}  3+  units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)  18  ({Ca(H  2  O)  2  }O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  2  ) and [{(PhTe)  18  ({Y(NO  3  )&#173;(H  2  O)}O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  3  ). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H  2  O}  2  }  2+  and {Y(NO  3  )(H  2  O)}  2+  building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Thebainone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deconstructive strategy involving the cleavage of relatively inert C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to build more complex scaffolds enabled the total synthesis of morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A in 13 (and 14) steps from commercially available starting materials (see scheme). The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboacylation reaction was applied successfully to the construction of various polycyclic skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A, capitalizing on an enantioselective C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaction. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8220;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8221; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allowed efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, we completed the synthesis of the morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A by two complementary routes.

         <title>Freezing&#8208;Assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon freezing, unmodified diblock DNAs containing an A5 block react with acrylic monomers in a freezing radical polymerization condition. This allows covalent conjugation to hydrogel nanoparticles and monoliths with an efficiency comparable to acrydite&#8208;modified DNA.







Abstract
Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75&#8201;% conjugation efficiency in 8&#8197;h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50&#8197;pM and 10&#8197;nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.

         <title>Polymorphism in Squaraine Dye Aggregates by Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway Differentiation: Panchromatic Tubular Dye Nanorods versus J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a newly synthesized bis(squaraine) dye was investigated revealing a supramolecular polymorphism dependent on the cooling rate. Fast cooling leads to helical nanorods, while slow cooling leads to more organized nanosheets.







Abstract
A bis(squaraine) dye equipped with alkyl and oligoethyleneglycol chains was synthesized by connecting two dicyanomethylene substituted squaraine dyes with a phenylene spacer unit. The aggregation behavior of this bis(squaraine) was investigated in non&#8208;polar toluene/tetrachloroethane (98:2) solvent mixture, which revealed competing cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathways into two supramolecular polymorphs with entirely different packing structures and UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties. The self&#8208;assembly pathway can be controlled by the cooling rate from a heated solution of the monomers. For both polymorphs, quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions between monomers and the respective aggregates can be established to derive thermodynamic parameters and insights into the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. AFM measurements revealed a nanosheet structure with a height of 2&#8197;nm for the thermodynamically more stable polymorph and a tubular nanorod structure with a helical pitch of 13&#8197;nm and a diameter of 5&#8197;nm for the kinetically favored polymorph. Together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements, packing models were derived: the thermodynamic polymorph consists of brick&#8208;work type nanosheets that exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands as typical for J&#8208;aggregates, while the nanorod polymorph consists of eight supramolecular polymer strands of the bis(squaraine) intertwined to form a chimney&#8208;type tubular structure. The absorption of this aggregate covers a large spectral range from 550 to 875&#8197;nm, which cannot be rationalized by the conventional exciton theory. By applying the Essential States Model and considering intermolecular charge transfer, the aggregate spectrum was adequately reproduced, revealing that the broad absorption spectrum is due to pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor overlap within the bis(squaraine) nanorods. The latter is also responsible for the pronounced bathochromic shift observed for the nanosheet structure as a result of the slip&#8208;stacked arranged squaraine chromophores.

         <title>Adducts of the Parent Boraphosphaketene H2BPCO and their Decarbonylative Insertion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8722;PCO) are prepared, and their dimerization, decarbonylation and use as synthons for phosphinidenes is explored, leading to a number of different B/P&#8208;containing heterocycles and transition&#8208;metal complexes thereof.







Abstract
The first examples of Lewis base adducts of the parent boraphosphaketene (H2B&#8208;PCO) and their cyclodimers are prepared. One of these adducts is shown to undergo mild decarbonylation and phosphinidene insertion into a B&#8722;C bond of a borole, forming very rare examples of 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines, B/P isosteres of benzene. The strong donor properties of these 1,2&#8208;phosphaborinines are confirmed by the synthesis of their &#960;&#8197;complexes with the Group&#8197;6 metals.

         <title>Impact of electrostatic interaction on bulk morphology in efficient donor&#8208;acceptor photovoltaic blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely&#8208;tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8211;Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8211;Enzyme Catalysis in Enantioselective Multistep One&#8208;Pot Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining organo&#8208;, bio&#8208;, and metal&#8208;catalyst for up to six synthetic steps allowed the one&#8208;pot production line towards (enantiopure) key building blocks for natural product synthesis as well as polymer science in gram&#8208;scale. The basis was set by an in&#8208;depth investigation of the initial steps of the sequence and investigating the central role of the organocatalyst {Org: 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)} as well as benzoic acid.







Abstract
Establishing one&#8208;pot, multi&#8208;step protocols combining different types of catalysts is one important goal for increasing efficiency in modern organic synthesis. In particular, the high potential of biocatalysts still needs to be harvested. Based on an in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of a new organocatalytic protocol employing two catalysts {1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO); benzoic acid (BzOH)}, a sequence was established providing starting materials for enzymatic refinement (ene reductase; alcohol dehydrogenase): A gram&#8208;scale access to a variety of enantiopure key building blocks for natural product syntheses was enabled utilizing up to six catalytic steps within the same reaction vessel.

         <title>Trifluorinated Tetralins via I(I)/I(III)&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion: Programming Conformation by [CH2CH2] &#8594; [CF2CHF] Isosterism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expand the current portfolio of saturated, fluorinated carbocycles for drug discovery, a main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based synthesis of novel, trifluorinated tetralins is disclosed. Isosteric replacement of [CH2&#8722;CH2] by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin, since the CH&#8722;F bond occupies a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation (&#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F*). This provides pre&#8208;organised module for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Saturated, fluorinated carbocycles are emerging as important modules for contemporary drug discovery. To expand the current portfolio, the synthesis of novel trifluorinated tetralins has been achieved. Fluorinated methyleneindanes serve as convenient precursors and undergo efficient difluorinative ring expansion with in situ generated p&#8208;TolIF2 (&gt;20 examples, up to &gt;95&#8201;%). A range of diverse substituents are tolerated under standard catalysis conditions and this is interrogated by Hammett analysis. X&#8208;ray analysis indicates a preference for the CH&#8722;F bond to occupy a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation, consistent with stabilising &#963;C&#8722;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8722;F* interactions. The replacement of the symmetric [CH2&#8722;CH2] motif by [CF2&#8722;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin scaffold leading to a predictable half&#8208;chair. The conformational behavior of this novel structural balance has been investigated by computational analysis and is consistent with stereoelectronic theory.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive 9&#8208;Carbene&#8208;9&#8208;Borafluorene Monoanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanions are isolated. In addition to complete characterization via X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, the nucleophilic character of the boryl anions is supported by DFT calculations and probed experimentally via reactions with metal halides and diketones.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of carbene&#8208;supported 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorenes with excess KC8, Na, or Li&#8208;naphthalenide affords six N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208; or cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borafluorene anions (3&#8211;8)&#8208;the first isolated and structurally authenticated examples of the elusive 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion. The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds 5 and 8 react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8208;E (E=Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (9&#8211;12). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from 5 or 8 to yield new B&#8208;O containing spirocycles (13&#8211;14) that cannot be easily obtained using &#8220;normal&#8221; valent borafluorene compounds. Collectively, these results support the notion that carbene&#8208;stabilized monoanionic borafluorenes may serve as a new platform for the one&#8208;step construction of higher&#8208;value boracyclic materials.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8722;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;based supramolecular catalyst has been designed to selectively recognize pyridine&#8208;like derivatives via secondary Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions. Owing to the distance between the substrate binding site and the active site as well as the geometrically constraints, meta&#8208;selective borylation reactions were accomplished displaying catalytic behaviors typically encountered in enzymes.







Abstract
The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208;economy C&#8722;H bond functionalization. The most powerful catalysts are found via trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications within them can lead to very different reactivities. To circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in these important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions that binds to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it can be found in some enzymes. The distance and spatial geometry between the active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented meta&#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh nanoparticle catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon were developed for asymmetric insertions of carbenoids derived from diazoesters into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. The nitrogen dopants are essential to promote the reactions. The catalyst could be reused several times and was applicable for a continuous&#8208;flow reaction system that produced the desired chiral amine for over 90&#8197;h through reactivation of the catalyst.







Abstract
Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90&#8197;h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.

         <title>Unified Synthesis of Polycyclic Alkaloids by Complementary Carbonyl Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient construction of polycyclic scaffolds of bioactive alkaloids by a novel annulation strategy enabled the synthesis of several natural products, including the dimeric berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B (see scheme). This versatile approach also served as the basis for a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;peganumine&#8197;A featuring an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization cascade.







Abstract
A complementary dual carbonyl activation strategy for the synthesis of polycyclic alkaloids has been developed. Successful applications include the synthesis of tetracyclic alkaloids harmalanine and harmalacinine, pentacyclic indoloquinolizidine alkaloid nortetoyobyrine, and octacyclic &#946;&#8208;carboline alkaloid peganumine&#8197;A. The latter synthesis features a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free assembly and an asymmetric disulfonimide&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. Furthermore, formal syntheses of hirsutine, deplancheine, 10&#8208;desbromoarborescidine&#8197;A, and oxindole alkaloids rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline have been achieved. Finally, a concise synthesis of berberine alkaloid ilicifoline&#8197;B was completed.

         <title>Fatty Acids and their Derivatives as Renewable Platform Molecules for the Chemical Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes the use of oils and fats as a renewable raw material by covering novel examples, such as selective oxidation or cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds in fatty acids, isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and the use of these renewables for polymer chemistry. Further topics include biocatalysis, the optimization of microorganisms by metabolic engineering, and the generation of new oil qualities in existing crop plants.







Abstract
Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10&#8197;years from 31 to 51 million tonnes annually. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarboxylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases and phospholipases, other enzymes have found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements have also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corroles substituted with only two or three carboxylic acid groups were obtained from readily available starting materials through a novel pathway (see scheme). These macrocycles and the corresponding metal chelates fulfill all the criteria of druglikeness and have potential for both bioimaging and therapy.







Abstract
Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogues) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very straightforward synthetic method that relies on surprisingly facile trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association with plasma proteins and their performance for catalase&#8208;like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering Studies of Block Copolymer Nano&#8208;Objects: Formation of Ordered Phases in Concentrated Solution During Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can produce lyotropic phases of block copolymer nano&#8208;objects. Time&#8208;resolved SAXS studies confirm that reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate in n&#8208;dodecane initially produces spheres exhibiting long&#8208;range order that subsequently evolve to form hexagonally packed worms. Serial dilution leads to disordered worms.







Abstract
We report that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be used to prepare lyotropic phases comprising diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects in non&#8208;polar media. RAFT dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) at 90&#8201;&#176;C using a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped hydrogenated polybutadiene (PhBD) steric stabilizer block in n&#8208;dodecane produces either spheres or worms that exhibit long&#8208;range order at 40&#8201;% w/w solids. NMR studies enable calculation of instantaneous copolymer compositions for each phase during the BzMA polymerization. As the PBzMA chains grow longer when targeting PhBD80&#8211;PBzMA40, time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals intermediate body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonally close&#8208;packed (HCP) sphere phases prior to formation of a final hexagonal cylinder phase (HEX). The HEX phase is lost on serial dilution and the aligned cylinders eventually form disordered flexible worms. The HEX phase undergoes an order&#8211;disorder transition on heating to 150&#8201;&#176;C and a pure HCP phase forms on cooling to 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Genetic Engineering in Combination with Semi&#8208;Synthesis Leads to a New Route for Gram&#8208;Scale Production of the Immunosuppressive Natural Product Brasilicardin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a heterologous producer strain that enables the sustainable production of the stereochemically complex natural products brasilicardin&#8197;C and&#8197;E at excellent rates is presented. The semi&#8208;synthetic approach allows an efficient gram&#8208;scale conversion of brasilicardin&#8197;E into the potent immunosuppressant brasilicardin&#8197;A for which the first preclinical data are reported.







Abstract
Brasilicardin&#8197;A (1) consists of an unusual anti/syn/anti&#8208;perhydrophenanthrene skeleton with a carbohydrate side chain and an amino acid moiety. It exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity, yet its mode of action differs from standard drugs that are currently in use. Further pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of this promising, biologically active natural product is hampered by restricted access to the ready material, as its synthesis requires both a low&#8208;yielding fermentation process using a pathogenic organism and an elaborate, multi&#8208;step total synthesis. Our semi&#8208;synthetic approach included a) the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin&#8197;A gene cluster in different non&#8208;pathogenic bacterial strains producing brasilicardin&#8197;A aglycone (5) in excellent yield and b) the chemical transformation of the aglycone 5 into the trifluoroacetic acid salt of brasilicardin&#8197;A (1&#8201;a) via a short and straightforward five&#8208;steps synthetic route. Additionally, we report the first preclinical data for brasilicardin&#8197;A.

         <title>Neither too Classic nor too Exotic: One&#8208;Electron Na&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722; Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;centre one&#8208;electron bond (2c&#8211;1e): Chemical bonding analysis using electron localization function (ELF), at correlated level, shows that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B 2c&#8211;1e bond.







Abstract
It is here reported that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B one&#8208;electron bond, a well&#8208;established type of electron&#8208;deficient bonding in the literature. The topological analysis of the electron localization function, at the correlated level, reveals that Na&#8722;, when approaching the bonding distance, fairly distributes its valence electron pair between two lobes. One of these electrons is used to bond with BH3, which participates through its boron empty p&#8208;orbital. Furthermore, the bonding situation of LiBH3&#8722;, KBH3&#8722;, MgBH3, and CaBH3 global minima structures are similar to that of NaBH3&#8722;, extending the family of these new one&#8208;electron bond systems with biradicaloid character.

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystal nucleus and the growth of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.







Abstract
The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.

We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many paired electrochemical reactions use perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, but this matching is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. Oxidation reactions were paired with H2 generation, showing the generality of the anodic process. This effort was followed by pairing multiple cathodic reactions with a pair of established oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Paired electrochemical reactions allow the optimization of both atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. In principle, any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode, showing the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. This is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis to complete the picture and illustrate how oxidation and reduction reactions can be combined.

         <title>Isolation of Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic B2P2 Rings by Diphosphorus Addition to a Boron&#8722;Boron Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room temperature P&#8722;P bond addition to an NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne yielded a four&#8208;membered B2P2 heterocycle, which can be further oxidised to a radical cation and a dication depending on the oxidation reagent and its counterion.







Abstract
The NHC&#8208;stabilised diboryne (B2(SIDep)2; SIDep=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) undergoes a high&#8208;yielding P&#8722;P bond activation with tetraethyldiphosphine at room temperature to form a B2P2 heterocycle via a diphosphoryldiborene by 1,2&#8208;diphosphination. The heterocycle can be oxidised to a radical cation and a dication, respectively, depending on the oxidant used and its counterion. Starting from the planar, neutral 1,3&#8208;bis(alkylidene)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diborata&#8208;2,4&#8208;diphosphoniocyclobutane, each oxidation step leads to decreased B&#8722;B distances and loss of planarity by cationisation. X&#8208;ray analyses in conjunction with DFT and CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations reveal closed&#8208;shell singlet, butterfly&#8208;shaped structures for the NHC&#8208;stabilised dicationic B2P2 rings, with their diradicaloid, planar&#8208;ring isomers lying close in energy.

         <title>Ultrafast and Stable Proton Conduction in Polybenzimidazole Covalent Organic Frameworks via Confinement and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensing benzimidazole units via topology&#8208;directed polymerization allows the construction of stable covalent organic frameworks with ordered one&#8208;dimensional channels. The walls trigger multiple hierarchical interactions so that the proton networks are locked in the pores via spatial confinement and activated via deprotonation. Ultrafast and stable anhydrous proton conduction is achieved over a wide range of temperatures.







Abstract
Polybenzimidazoles are engineering plastics with superb thermal stability and this specificity has sparked a wide&#8208;ranging research to explore proton&#8208;conducting materials. Nevertheless, such materials encounter challenging issues owing to phosphoric acid proton carrier leakage and slow proton transport. We report a strategy for designing porous polybenzimidazole frameworks to address these key fundamental issues. The built&#8208;in channels are designed to be one&#8208;dimensionally extended, unidirectionally aligned, and fully occupied by neat phosphoric acid, while the benzimidazole walls trigger multipoint, multichain, and multitype interactions to spatially confine a phosphoric acid network in pores and facilitate proton conduction via deprotonation. The materials exhibit ultrafast and stable proton conduction for low proton carrier content and activation energy&#8212;a set of features highly desired for proton transport. Our results offer a design strategy for the fabrication of porous polybenzimidazoles for use in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Redox&#8208;responsive gene delivery from perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions through cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.</dc:description>

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of carboxylic acids to disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for the base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that engages a trisulfide dioxide by homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared via a newly described approach. Each of 1 &#176; , 2 &#176; &#160;and 3 &#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8208;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve&#160; &#947; &#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8211;H disulfuration of amides via radical relay. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 vs S3 of the trisulfide dioxides are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;Amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and of its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate (Glu) is a crucial fundamental excitatory neurotransmitter released through vesicular exocytosis in the central nervous system. Hence, quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire prone to selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (  ca.  125 nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. Combination of these two series of measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected. By affording quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu inside living neurons and of its sub&#8208;quantal release fractions this work is opening new possibilities for investigating in situ and in time the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of photolatent bases for locally controlling dynamic exchange reactions in thermo&#8208;activated vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure as characteristic for classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (  T  v  ) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serios lack in methods which enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above  T  v  . Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8208;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network&#8217;s  T  v  , only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterifications in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8208;3&#160;nm) &#8211; ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#160;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#160;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal &#8211; is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspension and powder under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8208;organic compounds at room&#8208;temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of A Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] ( 2 ) [Tbt = 2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S = 0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibit two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 ( 1 ).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy  par excellence  to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established  13  C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF  5  Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF  5  group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF  5  Cl often relied on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatuses. Herein we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF  5  Cl in  n  &#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF  5  Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K  3  PO  4  or copper catalyst respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various  &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds  of high value for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Magnesium&#8208;air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of&#160;dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190 mAh&#183;g  &#8208;1  based on the total Mg anode (99.3% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282 Wh&#183;kg  &#8208;1  based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li  3  PO  4  and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li||Li cell, more than 300 cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Prototypical Li&#8208;O  2  and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic, covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleic acid sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Degrader for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1/2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:   Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2  VHL  E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two  &#8208;digit nanomolar DC  50  s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;triggered ROS amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0.







Abstract
Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Herein, we present a new strategy for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of cancer cells/tissues based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone (&#946;&#8208;Lap, an anticancer agent) triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues. With the strategy, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe PSiR3 developed in this work with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0. What's more, the strategy allowed the fluorescence discrimination of tumor tissues from inflammatory ones based on whether a marked fluorescence enhancement could be induced when treated with PSiR3 and &#946;&#8208;Lap/PSiR3 combination, respectively.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonded ternary cocrystals were synthesized by employing three different approaches. The possible reasons for the formation of these cocrystals have been proposed based on a detailed crystal packing analysis and computational results.







Abstract
Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to be of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.

         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first terminal imido complex of an iron&#8211;sulfur cluster has been synthesized and fully characterized. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis suggest an [Fe4S4]2+=[NAr]2&#8722; formulation with a localized high&#8208;spin Fe3+ valence at the imido&#8208;bound site, and reactivity studies demonstrate competence for C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3 to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center, which is manifested in its long Fe&#8722;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#8197;&#197;. Cluster 2 abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Ferroelectric and Spin Crossover Behavior in a Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular ferroelectrics induced by molecular rotors, multifunctional compound exhibiting both ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior was constructed. The flip&#8211;flop motion of polarization unit results in the expression of ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior.







Abstract
Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)2](BPh4)2&#8901;3ac (1&#8901;3&#8201;ac; FPh&#8208;terpy=4&#8242;&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8211;flop motion of the ligand's polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8211;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8211;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric materials.

         <title>Supramolecular cylinders target bulge structures in the 5'&#160;UTR of the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and inhibit viral replication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine RNA analysis with Molecular Dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5' UTR of &#160;the&#160;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in the stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Reorganization of Self&#8208;Assembled DNA&#8208;Based Polymers using Orthogonally Addressable Building Blocks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that can re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments.







Abstract
Nature uses non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve structural dynamic reconfiguration of biopolymers. Taking advantage of the programmability of DNA/DNA interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured by external inputs. The different tiles share the same sticky ends responsible for self&#8208;assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator&#8208;binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands. We show that by sequentially adding specific inputs it is possible to re&#8208;organize the formed structures to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers, random and block structures. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA&#8208;based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable micron&#8208;scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical and thermal activation enable the solvent&#8208;free oligomerization of inactivated amino acids in the presence of TiO2 to form peptides. Our observations validate the usefulness of mechanochemistry to simulate and study prebiotic chemistry in an impact scenario where dry land and mineral surfaces are critical for the concentration and formation of organic building blocks.







Abstract
The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. Prebiotically plausible pathways to peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear as most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Now, a combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine.

     alt="Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical and thermal activation enable the solvent&#8208;free oligomerization of inactivated amino acids in the presence of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form peptides. Our observations validate the usefulness of mechanochemistry to simulate and study prebiotic chemistry in an impact scenario where dry land and mineral surfaces are critical for the concentration and formation of organic building blocks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. Prebiotically plausible pathways to peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear as most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Now, a combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic oligomer micelle was formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers. The well&#8208;defined nanostructure remains intact even under dilution and at high temperature. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes; the resultant host&#8211;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers.







Abstract
An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both high stability and high uptake ability, was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers, composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ca. 2&#8197;nm, remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (ca. 3&#8197;&#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (&#916;H=&#8722;110&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as a Robust Oxygen Evolution Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MOFs on nickel foam (NF) were assembled. NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior OER performance (overpotential of 195&#8197;mV at 10 and 241&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions. The ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV (lower than NiFe double hydroxides: 0.81&#8197;eV).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195&#8197;mV and 241&#8197;mV at 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV, which is lower than that (0.81&#8197;eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.

         <title>The Redox Journey of Iconic Ferrocene: Ferrocenium Dications and Ferrocenate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent discoveries of both dicationic and monoanionic ferrocene derivatives throw light on the effect of the substituents on the C5 ring as well as the choice of redox agents and solvent system in the preparation of previously believed to be difficult synthetic targets. These oxidized and reduced forms of ferrocene are of interest to spectroscopists, magnetochemists, and theoreticians.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide nanomotors induce multiple acidosis in tumor cells by destroying tumor metabolic symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H  2  S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5 V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9%, showing long cycling stability over 800 cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8208;20 &#176;C for 150 cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.</dc:description>

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;based Chiral Porous Polyimides for Enantioselective Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral porous polyimides (FTPI) were synthesized using monomers of chiral 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene. The absolute configurations were identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The obtained R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.







Abstract
Enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (R, R&#8208;1 and S, S&#8208;1) are split by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral porous polyimides (FTPI) were synthesized using monomers of chiral 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene. The absolute configurations were identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The obtained &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;FTPI and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.

         <title>Advanced Low&#8208;Flammable Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes are developed for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With fluoroethylene carbonate as a proper electrolyte additive, the trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte achieves greatly extended cycle life over the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte, due to the formation of enhanced surface protection layers, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.







Abstract
Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMPa) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMPa and tuning the composition of the solvation sheaths via electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMPa&#8208;based electrolytes in Gr&#8741;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.4&#8197;V, the batteries containing the TMPa&#8208;based LHCE with a proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4&#8201;%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2&#8201;%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMPa, TMPa&#8208;based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.

         <title>Redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An redox&#8208;neutral  S  &#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO  &#8226;  and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)  2  ]  2+  or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)]  2+  , which readily release RSNO in 88&#8208;94% yield. The  S  &#8208;nitrosation reaction proceeds through a mixed&#8208;valence [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic  &#956;  &#8208;O site and nitrosates the RS  &#8722;  at the  &#956;  &#8208;NO site. The [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  complex is also competent for  O  &#8208;nitrosation of MeOH, which is isoelectronic to thiol. In this case, a rare [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(OMe)]  2+  intermediate has been isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the  S  &#8208;nitrosation proceeds through the intermediary of analogous [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(SR)]  2+  species. The redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral  S&#8208;  nitrosation process reported here represents the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating  S  &#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, adding further implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO  &#8226;  /RSNO.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proved to be a key reason in decreasing the reactivity of PSs against Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300 Wh kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

The system can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation process that prevails using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The current strategy worked for various alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8208;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanosomes have diverse morphologies in nature, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct observation of metal oxide nanoparticles being transformed into metal single atoms with oxygen&#8208;coordinated structure and high&#8208;loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis condition is a highly&#8208;efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordinations are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single atom catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10 wt%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750  o  C for 2 h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</dc:description>

         <title>High Pressure In Situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Reveals Turnstile Linker Rotation Upon Room&#8208;Temperature Stepped Uptake of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined crystallographic and computational investigation reveals a turnstile mechanism for the gated uptake of C1&#8211;C4 alkanes in a seemingly nonporous MOF. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals no significant structural change upon uptake of methane, while subnetwork displacement is induced by ethane uptake. Counterintuitively, only linker rotation without the creation of new space is observed for the sorption of propane and butane.







Abstract
The rare availability of suitable single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) structural data allows for the direct interpretation of the response of a framework to gas sorption and may lead to the development of improved functional porous materials. We report an in situ SCXRD structural investigation of a flexible MOF subjected to methane, ethane, propane, and butane gas pressures. Supporting theoretical investigations indicate weak host&#8211;guest interactions for the crystallographically modelled gaseous guests and, in addition, reveal that a turnstile mechanism facilitates the transport of alkanes through the seemingly nonporous system. Inflections present in the adsorption isotherms are furthermore rationalized as due to gate&#8208;opening, but without the expected creation of new accessible space.

         <title>Deliberate Construction of Polyoxoniobates Exploiting the Carbonate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate reacts with the labile decaniobate&#8208;POM, yielding new polyoxoniobates featuring carbonate ligands. The carbonate ligands reinforce oligomerization of clusters in solution that is observed in the solid&#8208;state and scaffolds and stabilizes larger cluster aggregates. Lanthanides directly replace Nb in PONb clusters, rather than associate electrostatically as previously observed. The lanthanide substitution is enabled by carbonate ligation.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=VV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, WVI) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb10O28]6&#8722; reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb10O25(CO3)6]12&#8722;, featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb24&#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is counterion, temperature, and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of Hot Carriers in Plasmonic Catalysis of C&#8722;N Bond Forming Reaction of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold nanoparticle catalyzes the oxidative coupling of benzylamine to form imine in presence of visible light. Photoexcitation of Au NP generates an electron&#8211;hole pair that activates adsorbates (reactants) at Au NP surface to form a strong oxidant&#8211;reductant pair (benzylamine radical cation and superoxide radical), which is conducive for the reaction at a low temperature, with high product yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous utilization of both the hot carriers (electrons and holes) in the photocatalytic transformation of benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine and the scope of reaction has also been successfully demonstrated with catalytic oxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzylamine. The wavelength&#8208;dependent excitation of AuNP allows us to tune the potential energy of charge carriers relative to the redox potential of the reactants which leads to energetically favorable product formation on the nanoparticle surface. We capture the formation of reaction intermediates and products by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, complemented by NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS. Based on the experimental substantiations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8211;Shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of asymmetrical plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) are created, displaying tailorable optical properties. Using amphiphilic polymer brushes, core&#8208;to&#8208;core or shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell dimers with controllable spatial precision and position of EM field enhancement are fabricated. DNA linkers are utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%), enabling them to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors.







Abstract
Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of (ca. 100/75/50/25&#8201;%) are presented. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior; tunability depends on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. The shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell or core&#8208;to&#8208;core JAuNNDs(50&#8201;%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50&#8201;%) by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND12(50&#8201;%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) with dual peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities induces ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this way Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT can be used against malignant tumors.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues near tumors, and the damage to cancer cells caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing the damage to healthy tissues simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperatures is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported: ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economical utilization of catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Versatile Direct Cyclization Constructs Spiro&#8208;acridan Derivatives for Highly Efficient TADF emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile direct cyclization is demonstrated to proceed by substituted diarylamines with various ketones under simple solvent&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. It shows huge potential in preparing spiro&#8208;acridan derivatives and TADF emitters.







Abstract
Spiro&#8208;acridan (SpA) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize SpAs is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct SpAs. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an example, D2T&#8208;TR with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1&#8201;%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.

         <title>Macroscopic Ultralight Aerogel Monoliths of Imine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step method produces COF aerogel monoliths, based on sol&#8211;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The aerogels have extremely low densities, high porosity, and mechanically behave as elastic or plastic materials under different strain. They show excellent absorption capacity with high removal efficiency.







Abstract
The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (ca. 0.02&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), high porosity (total porosity values of ca. 99&#8201;%), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt;25&#8211;35&#8201;%) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (e.g. toluene uptake: 32&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1), with high removal efficiency (ca. 99&#8201;%). The same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Switching Regioselectivity via Simple Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly effective Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative alkylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane with branched selectivity was achieved by using a cooperative strategy that integrated the unique trifunctional character of hydrazones with Pd/NHC catalysis.







Abstract
Conventional approaches for Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;couplings of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with nucleophiles predominantly deliver the &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkene scaffolds (linear selectivity). Herein, we report a cooperative strategy that can completely switch the reaction selectivity to give the alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkene skeletons (branched selectivity). The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enables analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including modified pharmaceutical and biological molecules, can be efficiently functionalized with high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluorinated alkene motifs under mild conditions.

The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enables analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including modified pharmaceutical and biological molecules, can be efficiently functionalized with high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluorinated alkene motifs under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Electrolysis of Anti&#8208;Perovskite Li2OHCl for Prelithiation of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was demonstrated could be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V via two oxidizing routes, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ that obtain electrons to deposit or intercalate in anode, with which as cathode Li&#8208;reservoir for pre&#8208;lithiation, the capacities of NMC811&#8741;Si@C full cells were increased proportionally with the varying dosage of pre&#8208;lithiation.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was previously studied as a solid&#8208;state Li+ conductor. Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3&#8197;V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of Li2OHCl starts at 4.0&#8197;V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3&#8197;V for the electrolysis of Li2OHCl. The electrolysis of Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 810&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer was prepared that is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy.







Abstract
In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid polymer containing siloxyl functional groups was synthesized and applied to encapsulate phase change materials (PCMs). Owing to the mild conditions of the hypercrosslinking reaction, which only requires the addition of a catalytic amount of aqueous alkaline solution, both organic and inorganic PCMs are tolerated. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate encapsulation rate of the PCMs and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid hydrophobic polymer in a phase change composite endows the latter with a unique self&#8208;cleaning property. This novel PCM encapsulation protocol is suitable for nanoparticles including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 600&#8201;% was achieved along with 93.7&#8201;% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1 without leakage.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Tracking and Dynamically Quantifying of Reversible Changes of Extracellular Ca2+ in Multiple Brain Regions of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array was created to real&#8208;time tracking and reversibly quantifying of extracellular concentration of Ca2+ together with neuron activity across many regions in freely moving mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke, and ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke.







Abstract
Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. We developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time quantify extracellular Ca2+ concentrations together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60&#8197;days, in which the signal degradation was &lt; ca. 8&#8201;%. The microarray with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution (ca. 10&#8197;&#956;m, ca. 1.3&#8197;s) was implanted into 7 brain regions of free&#8208;moving mice to monitor reversible changes of extracellular Ca2+ upon ischemia&#8208;reperfusion processes. The changing sequence and rate of Ca2+ in 7 brain regions were different during the stroke. ROS scavenger could protect Ca2+ influx and neuronal activity after stroke, suggesting the significant influence of ROS on Ca2+ overload and neuron death. We demonstrated this microarray is a versatile tool for investigating brain dynamic during pathological processes and drug treatment.

         <title>Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent silks with full&#8208;color emissions were fabricated through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation with five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). White light&#8208;emitting silk was prepared and demonstrated potential applications in flexible displays. Moreover, red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silk materials were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.

     alt="Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent silks with full&#8208;color emissions were fabricated through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation with five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). White light&#8208;emitting silk was prepared and demonstrated potential applications in flexible displays. Moreover, red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silk materials were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zinc Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of phosphonium&#8208;based supporting salts and a subtle difference in their ligand chemistry remarkably improves the reversibility of aqueous Zn electrolytes. By promoting interphase formation, P444(2O1)&#8208;TFSI supports a Zn coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even at 1.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle, and a stable Zn&#8741;Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cell cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density, and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain an ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or over 280&#8197;h at 2.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry

         <title>Structural and mechanistic insights into C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus  however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulphur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulphurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8208;sulphur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified  A. fumigatus  strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer in organic microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8216;hybrid&#8217; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (~100 nm). In this letter, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2 &#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8216;mesoscopic distances&#8217;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.</dc:description>

We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8216;mesoscopic distances&#8217;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering in High Performance Ambipolar Emissive Mesopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesopolymers, with structural defects free, high solubility and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation of conjugated polymers, open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. For example, organic light emitting transistors (OLETs) that integrate the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) together, and are promising devices for next generation display technology and organic electrically pumped laser. However, in most cases, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Therefore, the development of polymeric materials with high carrier mobility and light emitting ability becomes a key challenge. Herein, three low molecular weighted mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8208;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained by direct arylation polymerization of monomers. Resultant mesopolymers display strong solid state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility, making them competitive candidates for light&#8208;emission devices. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature, affording products with molecular weights of 3.8 kDa, 6.7 kDa, and 9.9 kDa for device characterization. All mesopolymers exhibit undetectable homo&#8208;coupling defects with gradiently&#8208;tunable energy levels and better electrical performance over the corresponding high molecular weight polymer. It is found that meso&#8208;TBTF with molecular weight of 6.7 kDa has the best electrical performance with an average mobility of 5.65 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for electrons and 1.50 &#215; 10&#8208;2 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for holes, which are among the highest ambibipolar luminescent polymers. In summary, all mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50% in solution and 10% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Anthracycline Utorubicin for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel anticancer compounds and their precision delivery systems are actively developed to create potent and well&#8208;tolerated anticancer therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel anthracycline, Utorubicin (UTO), and its preclinical development as an anticancer payload for nanocarriers. Free UTO was significantly more toxic to cultured tumor cell lines than the clinically used anthracycline, doxorubicin. Nanoformulated UTO, encapsulated in polymeric nanovesicles (polymersomes, PS), reduced the viability of cultured malignant cells and this effect was potentiated by functionalization with a tumor&#8208;penetrating peptide (TPP). Systemic peptide&#8208;guided PS showed preferential accumulation in triple&#8208;negative breast tumor xenografts implanted in mice. At the same systemic UTO dose, the highest UTO accumulation in tumor tissue was seen for the TPP&#8208;targeted PS, followed by nontargeted PS, and free doxorubicin. Our study suggests potential applications for UTO in the treatment of malignant diseases and encourages further preclinical and clinical studies on UTO as a nanocarrier payload for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;valence compounds as polarizing agents for Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization in solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper we investigate a novel set of polarizing agents &#8208; mixed&#8208;valence compounds &#8208; by theoretical and experimental methods and demonstrate their performance in high&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) NMR experiments in the solid state. Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules, in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, such polarizing agents can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP experiments in solid&#8208;state, with favorable conditions for dynamic nuclear polarization formation at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Hybrid Bi&#8208;microcompartments with Exocytosis&#8208;Inspired Behavior toward Fast Temperature&#8208;Modulated Transportation of living Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the unique characteristics of living cells, the creation of life&#8208;inspired functional ensembles is a rapidly expanding research topic, enabling transformative applications in various disciplines. Herein, we report a facile method for the fabrication of phospholipid and block copolymer hybrid bi&#8208;microcompartments via spontaneous asymmetric assembly at the water/tributyrin interface, whereby the temperature&#8208;mediated dewetting of the inner microcompartments allowed for exocytosis to occur in the constructed system. The exocytosis location and commencement time could be mediated by the buoyancy of the inner microcompartment and temperature, respectively. Furthermore, the constructed bi&#8208;microcompartments showed excellent biocompatibility and a universal loading capacity toward cargoes of widely ranging sizes; thus, the proliferation and temperature&#8208;programmed transportation of living organisms was achieved. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of complex mesoscale dynamic ensembles with life&#8208;inspired behaviors and provide a novel platform for on&#8208;demand transportation of various living organisms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics has achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon by the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen. Besides, multi&#8208;biomarker&#8208;based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8216;&#8216;bystander&#8217;&#8217; cells. Herein, we report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates the precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers the synergistic killing of effector aptamer&#8208;tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic&#8208;gated recognition integrated in aptamer&#8208;functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling,  in situ  capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported the rational design of single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on earth&#8208;abundant Sn&#8208;doped hematite nanorods (SF NRs) for high&#8208;rate, efficient CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion and unveiled the details of dielectric field&#8208;assisted hole&#8208;tunneling dynamics at the SMIS heterojunctions. The results showed that the RuO  x  &#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe  2  O  3  photoanode (SMIS&#8208;3), which was prepared by a combined methodology of atomic deposition of 3.0 nm thick Al  2  O  3  overlayer with chemical grafting of atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  hole&#8208;collectors, gives an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 52.0% under 370 nm light irradiation in 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, &gt;5&#8208;fold larger than that of the bare SF NRs photoanode. The characterization results clearly indicated that the dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al  2  O  3  /SF NRs interface. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber facilitates the fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  species, accelerating the O  2  &#8208;evolving reaction kinetics in the photoreaction compartment of PV&#8208;coupled artificial photosynthetic cells. Accordingly, a maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3 mmol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  &#8226;h  &#8208;1  was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO  2  &#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode, and an impressive overall quantum efficiency of 5.7% was recorded under 450 nm light irradiation.</dc:description>

The results showed that the RuO  x  &#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe  2  O  3  photoanode (SMIS&#8208;3), which was prepared by a combined methodology of atomic deposition of 3.0 nm thick Al  2  O  3  overlayer with chemical grafting of atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  hole&#8208;collectors, gives an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 52.0% under 370 nm light irradiation in 0.1 M neutral phosphate buffer solution at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl, &amp;gt;5&#8208;fold larger than that of the bare SF NRs photoanode. The characterization results clearly indicated that the dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al  2  O  3  /SF NRs interface. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber facilitates the fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to atomically&#8208;dispersed RuO  x  species, accelerating the O  2  &#8208;evolving reaction kinetics in the photoreaction compartment of PV&#8208;coupled artificial photosynthetic cells. Accordingly, a maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3 mmol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  &#8226;h  &#8208;1  was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO  2  &#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode, and an impressive overall quantum efficiency of 5.7% was recorded under 450 nm light irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to enrich energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the conventional reaction system for CO  2  photoreduction with pure H  2  O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. Recent surge of integrating photocatalytic CO  2  valorization with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to  achieve the sustainable economic and social development goals. This paper reviews the current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems of integrating CO  2  valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this photoredox&#8208;based win&#8208;win coupling strategy, as well as the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms are demonstrated. The ongoing challenges and prospects for further exploration of such versatile and efficient photoredox coupling reaction systems integrating CO  2  valorization with organic synthesis are critically discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymers for efficient Fluorocarbon&#8208;based Adsorption Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based cooling is an energy efficient renewable&#8208;energy technology that can be driven using low&#8208;grade industrial waste heat and/or solar heat. Here, we report the first exploration of fluorocarbon adsorption using porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) for this cooling application. High fluorocarbon R134a equilibrium capacities and unique overall linear&#8208;shaped isotherms are revealed for the materials, namely COP&#8208;2 and COP&#8208;3. The key role of mesoporous defects on this unusual adsorption behavior was demonstrated by molecular simulations based&#8208;on atomistic defective models built for both porous COPs. Analysis of simulated R134a adsorption isotherms for varying defect&#8208;containing atomistic models of the COPs shows a direct correlation between higher fluorocarbon adsorption capacities and increasing pore volumes induced by defects. Combined with their high porosities, excellent reversibility, fast kinetics, and large operating window, these defective porous COPs are proven to be promising for adsorption&#8208;based cooling applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of meso&#8208;chiral interconversion in butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor tunable by solvent properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over dynamic motion at the molecular level and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are important issues for making nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;actuators or nano&#8208;sensors. Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and still challenging area of research. In this report, demonstration of reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (  FDF  ) is given. Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;and meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180 &#176; &#160;revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (i.e. transition states).&#160;  FDF  &#160;in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso&#160;  cis  &#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral&#160;  trans  &#8208;conformation is more abundant. Additionally, moderate correlations between the&#160;  trans  &#8208;  FDF  /  cis  &#8208;  FDF  &#160;ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found. The results presented here have implementations in several fields of organic chemistry, such as design of artificial molecular machines, asymmetric/stereoselective reactions and solvent properties scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV&#8208;vis and  in situ  EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Crystallization of Highly Porous Cubic Covalent Organic Cage Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modular frameworks featuring well&#8208;defined pore structures in microscale domains establish tailor&#8208;made porous materials. For open molecular solids however, maintaining long&#8208;range order after desolvation is inherently challenging, since packing is usually governed by only a few supramolecular interactions. Here we report on two series of nanocubes obtained by co&#8208;condensation of two different hexahydroxy tribenzotriquinacenes (TBTQs) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acids (BDBAs) with varying linear alkyl chains in 2,5&#8208;position.&#160;  n  Butyl groups at the apical position of the TBTQ vertices yielded soluble model compounds, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. In contrast, methyl&#8208;substituted cages spontaneously crystallized as isostructural and highly porous solids with BET surface areas and pore volumes of up to 3426&#160;m  2  &#160;g  &#8722;1  &#160;and 1.82 cm  3  &#160;g  &#8722;1  . Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and sorption measurements revealed an intricate cubic arrangement of alternating micro&#8208; and mesopores in the range of 0.97&#8211;2.2&#160;nm that are fine&#8208;tuned by the alkyl substituents at the BDBA linker.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of an enantiopure sub&#8208;monolayer of helicenes radical cations on Au(111) surface via non&#8208;covalent interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality and magnetism of molecules are two properties that in the last years raised notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine these functionalities, and their nanostructuration is the first step toward&#160; developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel assembling strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate permitting the persistence of both the paramagnetic character and chirality of these molecules at the nanoscale. In&#8208;house characterizations demonstrated the retention of the chemical and paramagnetic properties after the deposition process. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A&#160; Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8208;Teller Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental and stringent concepts in chemistry. In transition elements chemistry, the 3  d  4  , 3  d  9  , and 3  d  7  configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated to a reduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na  9  Bi  5  Os  3  O  24  , the octahedron around Os  6+  (5  d  2  ) is heavily compressed, and the splitting of the  t  2g  set of 5  d  orbitals induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic ground state results. Both these issues are extremely rare. The splitting into a lower  d  xy  (hosting two  d  electrons with opposite spin) and two higher  d  xz  and  d  yz  orbitals is so large that the Hund&#180;s coupling for  t  2g  electrons is overcome. These effects are not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided Design of G Protein&#8208;coupled Receptor Polypharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diseases are polygenic and can only be treated efficiently with drugs that modulate multiple targets. However, rational design of compounds with multi&#8208;target profiles is rarely pursued because it is considered too difficult, in particular if the drug must enter the CNS. Here, a structure&#8208;based strategy to identify dual&#8208;target ligands of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors is presented. We use this approach to design compounds that both antagonize the A2A adenosine receptor and activate the D2 dopamine receptor, which have excellent potential as antiparkinson drugs. Atomic resolution models of the receptors guided generation of a chemical library with compounds designed to occupy orthosteric and secondary binding pockets in both targets. Structure&#8208;based virtual screens identified ten compounds, of which three had affinity for both targets. One of these scaffolds was optimized to nanomolar dual&#8208;target activity and showed the predicted pharmacodynamic effect in a rat model of Parkinsonism.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts can effectively facilitate carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. Specifically, 20% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8208;1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) during the 6 hours&#8208;test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism over Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: The Cu0 site activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; while the Cu+ site strengthens the *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8208;C coupling. This paper provides an efficient strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.</dc:description>
