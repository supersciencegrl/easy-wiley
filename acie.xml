         <title>Mechanism of the Photodegradation of A&#8208;D&#8208;A Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we elucidate the photodegradation pathway of A&#8208;D&#8208;A type nonfullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. Using IT&#8208;4F as a benchmark example, we isolated the photoproducts and proved them isomers of IT&#8208;4F formed via a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift. Importantly, this photoisomerization is accelerated under inert conditions which is explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction path (quenchable by oxygen). Adding controlled amounts of the photoproduct P1 to PM6:IT&#8208;4F bulk heterojunction cells leads to a progressive decrease of photocurrent and fill factor attributed to its poor absorption and charge transport properties. This cyclization is a general photodegradation pathway for a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini. The rate of the reaction varies widely with the nature of the donor and acceptor moiety, and we show an intriguing dramatic stabilization upon replacing the thiophene in the donor core with methylfuran.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Perfluoroalkylative Carbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes: Access to &#946;&#8208;Perfluoroalkyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component carbonylation represents an efficient strategy for the preparation of various functionalized carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a  general palladium&#8208;catalyzed  perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes using inexpensive and readily available carbon monoxide as the C1 source and perfluoroalkyl halides as the coupling partner. A wide range of phenols and alcohols were transformed into the corresponding  &#946;  &#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters in high yields with broad functional group tolerance and good chemoselectivity. Additionally, alkyl halides can be utilized as alkoxy source as well to give the desired esters. Moreover, several pharmaceutical and bio&#8208;active molecules were also suitable substrates for this one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component carbonylation process to give the targeted products in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bayesian Optimization of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Compositions for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active, selective and stable catalysts are imperative for sustainable energy conversion, and engineering materials with such properties are highly desired. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) offer a vast compositional space for tuning such properties. Too vast, however, to traverse without the proper tools. Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag&#8208;Pd, Ir&#8208;Pt, and Pd&#8208;Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phase Inversion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Fabrication of Helical Microfibers towards Versatile Artificial Abdominal Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microfluidic spinning technology (MST), incorporating microfluidics with chemical reactions, has fastened considerable interests in constructing anisotropic advanced microfibers, especially helical microfibers. However, subsistent efforts suffer from the limited material choices, restricting their applications. Here, a new phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) method is proposed for producing helical microfibers. This method undergoes a physicochemical phase inversion process, which is capable of efficiently manufacturing strong (tensile stress of more than 25 MPa), stretchable, flexible and biocompatible helical microfibers. The helical microfibers can be used to fabricate bi&#8208;oriented stretchable artificial abdominal skin, preventing incisional hernia formation and promoting the wound healing without conglutination. This research not only offers a universal approach to design helical microfibers, but also provides a new insight into artificial skins.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Single&#8208;cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found that abnormal lipid metabolism occurs in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor or a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive Antimony(I) Cation and its Coordination Complexes with Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fugitive antimony(I) cation  1  has been stabilized by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene  L,  exhibiting the first case of nucleophilic behaviour towards coinage metals. Compound  1  has been strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl  3  ,  L  and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane sulfonate taken in 1:2:3 ratio, wherein  L  plays the dual role of a reductant and supporting ligand. Generation of  1  involves corresponding two&#8208;electron oxidation of  L  forming the P&#8208;P bonded diphosphonium dication  2  . Both products have been separated in pure form with moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the Sb(I) site in  1  bind to the metal centres forming complexes with Au(I) (  3  ), Ag (I) (  4&#8208;5  ) and Cu(I) (  6&#8208;7  ). Compound  1  reduced Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by coordination with Cu(I) yielding  8  . The benefits of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained  peri  &#8208;geometry for stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of  1  have been rationalized through computational studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for better understanding the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8208;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allows the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Garsubellin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features use of a dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin&#8197;A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.

         <title>Segmented Polyurethanes and Thermoplastic Elastomers from Elemental Sulfur with Enhanced Thermomechanical Properties and Flame Retardancy</title>

From petroleum refining to thermoplastic elastomers and flame retardants: We report on a new synthetic method to prepare segmented polyurethanes and thermoplastic elastomers from elemental sulfur which have improved thermomechanical properties and flame retardancy.







Abstract
The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high&#8208;performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S8 with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods, a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging. These sulfur&#8208;based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8211;24&#8197;MPa) and ductility (348&#8201;% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578&#8201;% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active and robust single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was developed for CO oxidation by tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ through thermal&#8208;shock synthesis (see picture). Ultrafast shockwaves in an inert atmosphere generated Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration, resulting in greatly enhanced low&#8208;temperature activity that was retained under oxidizing conditions.







Abstract
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst formed by atom trapping (AT, 800&#8201;&#176;C in air) shows excellent thermal stability but is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures owing to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt2+ in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt1O4 coordination environment. Reductive activation to form Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity; however, the NPs are easily oxidized, leading to drastic activity loss. Herein we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ by thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt;1200&#8201;&#176;C) in an inert atmosphere induced surface reconstruction of CeO2 to generate Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration. Owing to this unique coordination, Pt1&#948;+ in a partially reduced state dynamically evolves during CO oxidation, resulting in exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt1/CeO2_TS catalyst was retained under oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight into Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of the stacking patterns of molecular two&#8208;dimensional layers in a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals by a chemical modification is demonstrated. The effect of the chemical modification is discussed in terms of both the enthalpic and entropic contributions based on experimental and computational results.







Abstract
Control over the stacking patterns in 2D molecular assemblies is demonstrated using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal (2:1) composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) (PyCA). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in PyCA exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect: the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.

         <title>Practical Chemoselective Acylation: Organocatalytic Chemodivergent Esterification and Amidation of Amino Alcohols with N&#8208;Carbonylimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective esterification or aniline amidation of polyfunctional molecules is possible by a catalytic chemodivergent protocol involving only simple reagents: N&#8208;acylimidazoles and either DBU or pyridinium ion (see scheme). These reactions may be performed in the simultaneous presence of phenols, indoles, amides, some aliphatic amines, and other groups. A mechanism&#8208;based model for predicting the acylation chemoselectivity is provided.







Abstract
Chemoselective transformations are a cornerstone of efficient organic synthesis; however, achieving this goal for even simple transformations, such as acylation reactions, is often a challenge. We report that N&#8208;carbonylimidazoles enable catalytic chemodivergent aniline or alcohol acylation in the presence of pyridinium ions or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU), respectively. Both acylation reactions display high and broad chemoselectivity for the target group. Unprecedented levels of chemoselectivity were observed in the DBU&#8208;catalyzed esterification: A single esterification product was obtained from a molecule containing primary aniline, alcohol, phenol, secondary amide, and N&#8722;H indole groups. These acylation reactions are highly practical as they involve only readily available, inexpensive, and relatively safe reagents; can be performed on a multigram scale; and can be used on carboxylic acids directly by in situ formation of the acylimidazole electrophile.

&lt;p&gt;Highly chemoselective esterification or aniline amidation of polyfunctional molecules is possible by a catalytic chemodivergent protocol involving only simple reagents: &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylimidazoles and either DBU or pyridinium ion (see scheme). These reactions may be performed in the simultaneous presence of phenols, indoles, amides, some aliphatic amines, and other groups. A mechanism-based model for predicting the acylation chemoselectivity is provided.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dienes: An Alternative to Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction is one of the most powerful methods for allylic oxidation of alkenes. However, the inherent radical mechanism and use of peroxides as both oxidants and oxygen nucleophiles render dearth of universal catalytic systems for highly enantioselective variants and limited scope. Herein, an alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Detailed mechanistic studies provide evidences for the radical&#8208;based reaction pathway.

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;substituted CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) have been rationally designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation and subsequent gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. The desired hollow structure and multielement composition with abundant Ni3+ active sites endow P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs with high electrocatalytic activity and robust stability towards electrochemical hydrogen production via water splitting and urea electrolysis.







Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8722;0.135&#8197;V, 1.512&#8197;V, and 1.306&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544&#8197;V in water splitting and 1.402&#8197;V in urea electrolysis to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent durability for 100&#8197;h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production and provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.

         <title>Electronic Modulation Caused by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and spontaneous strategy is presented for synthesizing Ru&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;anchored metal&#8211;organic frameworks nanohybrids on Ni foam. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent HER performance at all pH values owing to the optimized adsorption free energies of intermediates by the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.







Abstract
Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics. As a result, the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.

         <title>Ordered Conformation&#8208;Regulated Vesicular Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polypeptide vesicles can regulate their membrane permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations. Particularly, a transformation from extended &#946;&#8208;strands to compact &#945;&#8208;helices in response to reactive oxygen species reduces the vesicular wall thickness and remodels the membrane structure, thereby enhancing the membrane permeability for efficient nanoreaction, glucose&#8208;triggered insulin secretion and effective therapy of diabetes mellitus.







Abstract
In nature, the folding and conformation of proteins can control the cell or organelle membrane permeability and regulate the life activities. Here we report the first example of synthetic polypeptide vesicles that regulate their permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations, in a manner similar to biological systems. The polymersomes undergo a &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to wall thinning without loss of vesicular integrity. The change of membrane structure increases the vesicular permeability and enables specific transport of payloads with different molecular weights. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the polymersomes encapsulating enzymes could serve as nanoreactors and carries for glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin secretion in vivo inspired by human glucokinase, resulting in safe and effective treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in mouse models. This study will help understand the biology of biomembranes and facilitate the engineering of nanoplatforms for biomimicry, biosensing, and controlled delivery applications.

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: A Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unnatural amino acid, Asn(OH), mimics P1&#8208;Asn in the substrates of asparaginyl ligases, enabling efficient cyclization of P1&#8208;Asn(OH) peptides. The hydroxamic acid functionality in Asn(OH) is a metal&#8208;ion chelator for metalloenzyme inhibition, and Asn(OH) can be converted into native Asp by periodate oxidation (see scheme).







Abstract
Peptidyl asparaginyl ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely N&#947;&#8208;hydroxyasparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. By Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase&#8197;2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. The most potent cyclic peptide (Ki=2.8&#177;0.5&#8197;nM) was built on the hyperstable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. By this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization owing to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.

         <title>A Tale of Two Isomers: Enhanced Antiaromaticity/Diradical Character versus Deleterious Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzofuran&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes and Dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of benzofuran to either s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene results in two dramatically different outcomes depending upon heterocycle orientation. Whereas the &#8220;anti&#8221; isomers are unstable and hydrolyze readily to ring&#8208;opened products, the &#8220;syn&#8221; isomers are quite stable and afford molecules that either possess a high degree of antiaromaticity or exhibit pronounced diradical character.







Abstract
We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to s&#8208;indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3&#8208;functionalized benzofuran yields syn&#8208;IDBF and syn&#8208;IIDBF. syn&#8208;IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for syn&#8208;IIDBF. In the case of the anti&#8208;isomers, synthesized via 2&#8208;substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring&#8208;opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene&#8208;fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the syn&#8208;fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For syn&#8208;IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomati&#8208;zation of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable chiral rhodium(I) complexes bearing a helical aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain were synthesized by one&#8208;pot reactions of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH (see scheme). The persistent helical chirality of the complexes enabled their separation into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. The complexes served as bench&#8208;stable catalysts for living polymerization of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Unique bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by reactions of (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50&#8201;% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase at room temperature. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complexes functioned as initiators for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.

         <title>Mechanical Force for the Transformation of Aziridine into Imine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that  cis  &#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by  1  H NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Long Persistent Luminescence Through in&#8208;situ Generation of Cuprous(I) Ion Pairs in Ionic Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent development of most organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) systems employed binary or tertiary doping. However, the design strategies towards OLPL materials with longer afterglow duration are still quite limited. Here, we propose a novel OLPL system through melt&#8208;casting method with 0.1 mol% of Cu(I) complexes 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl BINAP&#8208;CuX (X=Cl, Br and I) doped into the triphenylphosphine (TPP) host. The charge separation was initiated prior to excitation through host coordination with Cu(I) complexes, resulting in semi&#8208;free halogen ions and in&#8208;situ generated Cu(I) cations, which forms TPP + BINAP&#8208;CuX ionic pairs and subsequently ionic solids. The OLPL lifetime can be readily modulated with different halogen atoms and the afterglow can last up to more than 3 hours perceivable to human eyes. This is a rare example of OLPL with coordinate complexes that could potentially expand the definition of OLPL systems and design strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805; 0.025 M. An additional  trans  &#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the  cis  &#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the  trans  &#8208;cyclobutane fused  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale analysis of historical paintings by means of O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy: The identification of the organic particles in L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux) by Van Gogh</title>

O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy applied to the analysis of the organic composition of samples from historical paintings is presented for the first time.







Abstract
Optical&#8208;photothermal infrared (O&#8208;PTIR) spectroscopy is a recently developed technique that provides spectra comparable to traditional transmission FTIR spectroscopy with nanometric spatial resolution. Hence, O&#8208;PTIR is a promising candidate for the analysis of historical paintings, as well as other cultural heritage objects, but its potential has not yet been evaluated. This work presents the first application of O&#8208;PTIR to the analysis of cultural heritage, and in particular to an extremely small fragment from Van Gogh's painting L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux). The striking results obtained, including the detection of geranium lake pigments as well as the complete analysis of the stratigraphy, failed with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, highlight the potential of this method. The integration of O&#8208;PTIR to the study of cultural heritage opens to the possibility of decreasing the amount of sample extracted, therefore contributing to the preservation of the integrity of artworks while providing a complete characterization of the materials.

         <title>Inhibition of S.&#8197;aureus Infection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by Trehalose&#8208; and Glucose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increased resistance against antibiotics, the fight against bacteria is becoming increasingly difficult. Here, we used a sugar that is unique to the bacteria metabolism, trehalose, and prepared trehalose&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to inhibit the infection of healthy cells by S.&#8197;aureus and could serve as a non&#8208;toxic alternative to prevent adhesion of certain bacteria.







Abstract
Microbial adhesion to host cells represents the initial step in the infection process. Several methods have been explored to inhibit microbial adhesion including the use of glycopolymers based on mannose, galactose, sialic acid and glucose. These sugar receptors are, however, abundant in the body, and are not unique to bacteria. Trehalose, in contrast, is a unique disaccharide that is widely expressed by microbes. This carbohydrate has not yet been explored as an anti&#8208;adhesive agent. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with trehalose&#8208;based polymers were prepared and compared to glucose&#8208;functionalized AuNPs and examined for their ability to prevent binding to endothelial cells. Acting as anti&#8208;adhesive agents, trehalose&#8208;functionalized NPs decreased the binding of S.&#8197;aureus to HUVECs, while outperforming the control NPs. Microscopy revealed that trehalose&#8208;coated NPs bound strongly to S.&#8197;aureus compared to the controls. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on trehalose could be a non&#8208;toxic alternative to inhibit S.&#8197;aureus infection.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Excited Multicolor Afterglow in Carbon Dots&#8208;Based Room&#8208;Temperature Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method is developed to activate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;excited multicolor afterglow of carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs) through radiative energy transfer from NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion materials (UMs). The resulting UM/CDAMs demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow from blue to orange under NIR CW laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A universal method is developed to activate near-infrared-excited multicolor afterglow of carbon dots-based RTA materials (CDAMs) through radiative energy transfer from NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb,Tm upconversion materials (UMs). The resulting UM/CDAMs demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow from blue to orange under NIR CW laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm.

         <dc:description>The severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and lithium (Li) metal anode become huge challenge to restrict ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8208;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to stably cycle for 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), which greatly enhances its electrochemical stability and suppresses the side reactions. We clearly identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, which endow homogeneous and efficient ions flux and uniform lithium depositions. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8208;20~60 &#186;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of chuangxinmycin featuring a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur is an essential element for all life by forming various sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Compared to the well&#8208;studied biological functions, the knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;  cd  ]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by  in vitro  biochemical characterization of the key enzymes, and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. Particularly, we reveal that the JAMM/MPN  +  protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Darzens&#8208;Type Epoxidation of Diazoesters: Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral trisubstituted epoxides were synthesized by boron&#8211;Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The developed reaction provides an efficient synthetic route to various chiral compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone, and epoxy diester.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8211;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.

         <title>Preparation of Bulk&#8208;Phase Nitride Perovskite LaReN3 and Topotactic Reduction to LaNiO2&#8208;Type LaReN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitride perovskites are extremely rare and challenging to synthesise, but an azide&#8208;mediated high&#8208;pressure route has been used to prepare LaReN3 which can be topotactically reduced to layered LaReN2.







Abstract
While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN3 perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due to synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. We report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN3 through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN3 has a low&#8208;symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN3 above 500&#8201;&#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN2 via a probable LaReN2.5 intermediate, which is the first reported example of nitride defect perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN3 and LaReN2 are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented are expected to lead to new classes of ABN3 and defect ABN3&#8722;x nitride perovskite materials.

         <title>Stable Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by an anion receptor was proposed for the construction of a stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The introduction of an anion receptor decreases the reduction stability of FSI&#8722; and increases the amount of FSI&#8722; in the form of AGG&#8208;II. The decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of the anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries are severely hindered by the dendritic Li deposition dictated by non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Despite its unique advantages in improving the uniformity of Li deposition, the current anion&#8208;derived SEI is unsatisfactory under practical conditions. Herein regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by anion receptors was proposed to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) anion acceptors with electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms interact with bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;) and decrease the reduction stability of FSI&#8722;. Furthermore, the type of aggregate cluster of FSI&#8722; in electrolyte changes, FSI&#8722; interacting with more Li ions in the presence of TPFPB. Therefore, the decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of anion&#8208;derived SEI. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries under practical conditions, the anion&#8208;derived SEI with TPFPB undergoes 194 cycles compared with 98&#8197;cycles of routine anion&#8208;derived SEI. This work inspires a fresh ground to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI by manipulating the electrolyte structure of anions.

The introduction of an anion receptor decreases the reduction stability of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and increases the amount of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the form of AGG-II. The decomposition of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is promoted, improving the stability of the anion-derived SEI under practical conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-energy-density lithium (Li) metal batteries are severely hindered by the dendritic Li deposition dictated by non-uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Despite its unique advantages in improving the uniformity of Li deposition, the current anion-derived SEI is unsatisfactory under practical conditions. Herein regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by anion receptors was proposed to construct stable anion-derived SEI. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) anion acceptors with electron-deficient boron atoms interact with bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and decrease the reduction stability of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the type of aggregate cluster of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in electrolyte changes, FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; interacting with more Li ions in the presence of TPFPB. Therefore, the decomposition of FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is promoted, improving the stability of anion-derived SEI. In working Li | LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries under practical conditions, the anion-derived SEI with TPFPB undergoes 194 cycles compared with 98&#8197;cycles of routine anion-derived SEI. This work inspires a fresh ground to construct stable anion-derived SEI by manipulating the electrolyte structure of anions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Solvent Polarity Induced Interface Self&#8208;assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine&#8208;based Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triazine&#8208;based materials with porous structure have recently recieved numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine&#8208;based materials with precise adjustable meso&#8208;scaled pore sizes and contrallable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Here,  we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223 &#8804; Lippert&#8208;Mataga parameter  &#160;&#8804; 0.295) to induce valid self&#8208;assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8208;14.0 nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO  2  adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO  2  over N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;S1N3 Catalysts via Integration with Cu Nanoclusters</title>

         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO 2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is an advanced technology for converting waste CO 2  and closing carbon cycle. This process was usually obstructed by large energy barriers for *COOH formation. In this study, we developed a novel tandem electrocatalyst for CO 2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co&#8208;coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  ) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu x  ), denoted as Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  . The configuration of Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  was clearly confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  composite presents a 100% Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FE CO  ) at &#8722;0.65 V vs. RHE and high FE CO  over 90% from &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.75 V, outperforming the analogue with a Cu&#8208;N 4  coordination sphere (FE CO  only 54% at &#8722;0.7 V). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the unsymmetrical Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu&#8208;N 4  site. At the same time, the adjacent Cu x  effectively promotes the protonation of *CO 2  &#8208; by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  active sites. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned single Cu atoms and Cu clusters integrated in carbon matrix play a synergistic role in lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*COOH formation) and cooperatively improving the reductive conversion of CO 2  to CO. This work provides a tandem strategy for facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer over the atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Reclaiming Inactive Lithium with a Triiodide/Iodide Redox Couple for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple is introduced with a SnI4 initiator to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, and the oxidation of LiI by a delithiated cathode realizes the restoration of Li ion in cathode from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; by oxidation engages the further redox reactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries suffer from a short lifespan owing to apparently ceaseless inactive Li accumulation, which is accompanied by the consumption of electrolyte and active Li reservoir, seriously deteriorating the cyclability of batteries. Herein, a triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple initiated by stannic iodide (SnI4) is demonstrated to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, which then diffuses to the cathode side. The oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode transforms cathode into the lithiation state and regenerates I3&#8722;, reclaiming Li ion from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; engages the further redox reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Sn mitigates the corrosion of I3&#8722; on active Li reservoir sacrificially. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries, the accumulated inactive Li is significantly reclaimed by the reversible I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox couple, improving the lifespan of batteries by twice. This work initiates a creative solution to reclaim inactive Li for prolonging the lifespan of practical Li metal batteries.

         <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of a Reactive [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2]2+ Intermediate in Cu/TEMPO Catalyzed Aerobic Alcohol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear CuI complex 1 activates O2 to form a bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species, which can efficiently couple O2 reduction and the oxidation of alcohols to make 1/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) a suitable catalyst system for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Notably, 1/TEMPO ensures a clean reduction of O2 to H2O, in contrast to (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)CuI/TEMPO, where the generation of H2O2 is proposed.







Abstract
CuI/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) catalyst systems are versatile catalysts for aerobic alcohol oxidation reactions to selectively yield aldehydes. However, several aspects of the mechanism are yet unresolved, mainly because of the lack of identification of any reactive intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a dinuclear [L12Cu2]2+ complex 1, which in presence of TEMPO can couple the catalytic 4&#8201;H+/4&#8201;e&#8722; reduction of O2 to water to the oxidation of benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The mechanisms of the O2&#8208;reduction and alcohol oxidation reactions have been clarified by the spectroscopic detection of the reactive intermediates in the gas and condensed phases, as well as by kinetic studies on each step in the catalytic cycles. Bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo)dicopper(III) (2) and bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species 3 are shown as viable reactants in oxidation catalysis. The present study provides deep mechanistic insight into the aerobic oxidation of alcohols that should serve as a valuable foundation for ongoing efforts dedicated towards the understanding of transition&#8208;metal catalysts involving redox&#8208;active organic cocatalysts.

         <title>Functional Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Class of Heterogeneous Halogen Bond Donor Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks have attracted great attention as they can be used as bio&#8208;inspired models, allowing us to gain important insights into how large biological molecules function as catalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and utilization of such a metal&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework (MMPF) that is constructed from a custom&#8208;designed ligand as an efficient halogen bond donor catalyst for Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under ambient conditions. The implementation of fabricated halogen bonding capsule as binding pocket with high&#8208;density C&#8208;Br bonds enabled the use of halogen bonding to facilitate organic transformations in their three&#8208;dimensional cavities. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we showed that the substrate molecules diffuse through the pores of the MMPF, establishing a host&#8208;guest system  via  the C&#8208;Br&#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960;  interaction. The formation of halogen bonds is a plausible explanation for the observed boosted catalytic efficiency in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Moreover, the unique capability of MMPF highlights new opportunities in using artificial non&#8208;covalent binding pockets as highly tunable and selective catalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that  in&#8208;situ  pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism, and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>An innovative approach for the generation of species of the interstellar medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. In the present work, we propose a novel approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The chemical species generated in the laser ablation process are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by eyes of high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of an impressive inventory of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this "micro&#8208;laboratory" in hands, we open the doors toward the generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation, base&#8208;activated latent sulfinate reagents have been successfully developed for use in the construction of heteroaromatic frameworks, such as 2&#8208;arylpyridines. Under Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions, these species unmask to give the sulfinate in situ, which then undergoes efficient desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with an array of (hetero)aryl halides.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides. However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations. Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents: &#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species generate the sulfinate salt in situ, which then undergo efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Powered Activatable Nanozyme Breaking pH and H2O2 Limitations for Treating Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. Instead of synthesizing new nanomaterials, we solved physiological limitations on nanozymes by regulating the local microenvironment. This strategy is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.







Abstract
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nanozymes is promising for chemodynamic therapy by catalyzing H2O2 into .OH. However, for most nanozymes, this activity is optimal just in acidic solutions, while the pH of most physiological systems is beyond 7.0 (even &gt;8.0 in chronic wounds) with inadequate H2O2. We herein communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. As a proof of concept, aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanozymes, glucose oxidase, and hyaluronic acid constitute an activatable nanocapsule &#8220;APGH&#8221;, which can be activated by bacteria&#8208;secreted hyaluronidase in infected wounds. Nanozymes bind onto bacteria through aptamer recognition, and glucose oxidation tunes the local pH down and supplements H2O2 for the in&#8208;situ generation of .OH on bacteria surfaces. The activity switching and enhanced antibacterial effect of the nanocapsule were verified in&#8197;vitro and in diabetic wounds. This strategy for directly regulating local microenvironment is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.

         <title>Restriction of Intramolecular Vibration in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens: Applications in Multifunctional Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly&#8208;like oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine molecules exhibit typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics through restriction of intramolecular vibrations. When used as ligands for the construction of MOFs, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with multiple luminescence properties are produced.







Abstract
Butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit the typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and have associated high costs, OAP AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably, OAP AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in pyrazine coordination sites. OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work builds on RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of the RIV process on the luminescence properties of MOFs.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and bench&#8208;stable dioxazolone reagent was developed for the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in tertiary and secondary alcohol&#8208;based substrates. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary and secondary C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8722;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Triphase Photocatalysis Over a Multifunctional Bilayer Paper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable TiO2/C bilayer paper for photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic phenol oxidation is reported. The triphase interface ensures the fast supply of oxygen reactant at high photon flux, whilst the photothermal effect promotes the subsequent phenol free radical reaction kinetics. Cycling stability, sunlight feasibility, oxygen concentration compatibility and flow condition demonstrate the possibility for large&#8208;scale photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Photocatalysis as one of the future environment technologies has been investigated for decades. Despite great efforts in catalyst engineering, the widely used powder dispersion and photoelectrode systems are still restricted by sluggish interfacial mass transfer and chemical processes. Here we develop a scalable bilayer paper from commercialized TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials, self&#8208;supported at gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid interfaces for photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species can be facilitated through fast oxygen diffusion over triphase interfaces, while the interfacial photothermal effect promotes the following free radical reaction for advanced oxidation of phenol. Under full spectrum irradiation, the triphase system shows 13 times higher reaction rate than diphase controlled system, achieving 88.4&#8201;% mineralization of high concentration phenol within 90&#8197;min full spectrum irradiation. The bilayer paper also exhibits high stability over 40 times cycling experiments and sunlight driven feasibility, showing potentials for large scale photocatalytic applications by being further integrated into a triphase flow reactor.

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs. Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstocks show appealing chemical properties, including accelerated ring closure and polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity. The derived polymers constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight, atactic yet high crystallinity, structural diversity, and chemical recyclability.







Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer's cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer's depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock &#945;&#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5&#8197;kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.

         <title>Photodriven Elimination of Chlorine From Germanium and Platinum in a Dinuclear PtII&#8594;GeIV Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel platinum dichloride complex supported by an ambiphilic bisphosphinodichlorogermane ligand photo&#8208;isomerizes into a tetravalent platinum trichloride germyl complex. Further irradiation of this new complex triggers the elimination of chlorine and the formation of a covalent Pt&#8211;Ge bond. Transient absorption spectroscopy points to the intermediacy of a charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the nascent chlorine atom and the aromatic ligand.







Abstract
Searching for a connection between the two&#8208;electron redox behavior of Group&#8208;14 elements and their possible use as platforms for the photoreductive elimination of chlorine, we have studied the photochemistry of [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2GeIVCl2]PtIICl2 and [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtIIICl3, two newly isolated isomeric complexes. These studies show that, in the presence of a chlorine trap, both isomers convert cleanly into the platinum germyl complex [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtICl with quantum yields of 1.7&#8201;% and 3.2&#8201;% for the GeIV&#8211;PtII and GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomers, respectively. Conversion of the GeIV&#8211;PtII isomer into the platinum germyl complex is a rare example of a light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal/main&#8208;group&#8208;element bond&#8208;forming process. Finally, transient&#8208;absorption&#8208;spectroscopy studies carried out on the GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomer point to a ligand arene&#8211;Cl. charge&#8208;transfer complex as an intermediate.

         <title>Location Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln  3+  ) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln  3+  selectivity for moderately large Ln  3+  ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1 nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln  3+  selectivity within a protein.</dc:description>

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location-dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location-dependent Ln  3+  selectivity within a protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrosulfide (HS&#8208;) Recognition and Sensing in Water by Halogen Bonding Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) plays a crucial signalling role in a variety of physiological systems, existing as the hydrosulfide anion (HS  &#8208;  ) at physiological pH. Combining the potency of halogen bonding (XB) for anion recognition in water with coumarin fluorophore incorporation in acyclic host structural design, the first XB receptors to bind and, more importantly sense the hydrosulfide anion in pure water in a reversible chemosensing fashion, are demonstrated. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding to HS  &#8211;  . Computational DFT and Molecular Dynamics simulations investigation in water corroborate the experimental anion binding observations, revealing the mode and nature of HS  &#8208;  recognition by the XB receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral selectivity of secondary nucleation in amyloid fibril propagation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental feature of asymmetric molecules and of critical importance for intermolecular interactions. The growth of amyloid fibrils displays a strong enantioselectivity, which is manifested as elongation through the addition of monomers of the same, but not opposite, chirality as the parent aggregate. Here we ask whether also secondary nucleation on the surface of amyloid fibrils, of relevance for toxicity, is governed by the chirality of the nucleating monomers. We use short amyloid peptides (A&#946;20&#8208;34 and IAPP20&#8208;29) with all residues as L&#8208; or all D&#8208;enantiomer in self and cross&#8208;seeding experiments with low enough seed concentration that any acceleration of fibril formation is dominated by secondary nucleation. We find a strong enantio&#8208;specificity of this auto&#8208;catalytic process with secondary nucleation being observed in the self&#8208;seeding experiments only. The results highlight a role of secondary nucleation in strain propagation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Printed Nanochain&#8208;based Colorimetric Assay for Quantitative Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody&#8208;modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15 min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of ~ 1 PFU &#956;L  &#8208;1  through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real&#8208;time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 x 10  5  PFU mL  &#8208;1  . This low&#8208;cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Light is a convenient source of energy and the heart of light&#8208;harvesting natural systems and devices. Here, we show light&#8208;modulation of both the chemical nature and ionic charge carrier concentration within a protein&#8208;based biopolymer that was covalently functionalized with photoacids or photobases. We explore the capability of the biopolymer&#8208;tethered photoacids and photobases to undergo excited&#8208;state proton transfer and capture, respectively. Electrical measurements show that both the photoacid&#8208; and photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymers exhibit an impressive light&#8208;modulated increase in ionic conductivity. Whereas cationic protons are the charge carriers for the photoacid&#8208;functionalized biopolymer, water&#8208;derived anionic hydroxides are the suggested charge carriers for the photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymer. Our work introduces a versatile toolbox to light&#8208;modulate charge carriers in polymers of both positive protons and negative hydroxides, which can be of interest for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve an Exceptionally High Iodine&#8208;Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate covalent organic frameworks provide an ideal platform for ionic functionalization, enabling the integration of large surface areas, high pore volumes, and abundant binding sites, thereby leading to unprecedented levels of I2&#8208;capture performance under both static and dynamic adsorption conditions.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I2) capture has great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. In this study, we apply a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I2 capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits a static I2 uptake capacity of 10.21&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C and a dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8776;400&#8197;ppm I2 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 also exhibits fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I2 adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving a high I2 capture performance.

&lt;p&gt;Adsorption-based iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) capture has great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. In this study, we apply a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. The optimized material iCOF-AB-50 exhibits a static I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity of 10.21&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 75&#8201;&#176;C and a dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;400&#8197;ppm I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 25&#8201;&#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. iCOF-AB-50 also exhibits fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving a high I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metagenome&#8208;Guided Analogue Synthesis Yields Improved Gram&#8208;Negative&#8208;Active Albicidin&#8208; and Cystobactamid&#8208;Type Antibiotics</title>

         <dc:description>
Biosynthetic instructions contained within congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been used to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. &#961;&#8208;Aminobenzoic acid encoding BGCs cloned from soil metagenomes have guided the synthesis of albicidin and cystobactamid analogues that show increased potency, different spectra of activity, as well as the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.







Abstract
Natural products are a major source of new antibiotics. Here we utilize biosynthetic instructions contained within metagenome&#8208;derived congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. Albicidin and cystobactamid are the first members of a new class of broad&#8208;spectrum &#961;&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;based antibiotics. Our search for PABA&#8208;specific adenylation domain sequences in soil metagenomes revealed that BGCs in this family are common in nature. Twelve BGCs that were bio&#8208;informatically predicted to encode six new congeners were recovered from soil metagenomic libraries. Synthesis of these six predicted structures led to the identification of potent antibiotics with changes in their spectrum of activity and the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.

         <title>Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8211;O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trifluoroacyl radical is generated by C&#8722;O bond fragmentation of trifluoroacetic anhydride under photoredox conditions and undergoes olefinic C&#8722;H bond trifluoroacetylation in a mechanistically unique fashion. The protocol is operationally simple, scalable, and enables the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex biorelevant molecules delivering the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones in one step.







Abstract
We report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low&#8208;cost and readily available reagent. This light&#8208;mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers a C&#8722;O bond fragmentation. Mechanistic studies (kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, theoretical investigations) highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF3CO radical under photoredox conditions. The trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, the method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simply changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of small&#8208;molecule drugs and common pharmacophores.

         <title>Rapid Access to Ordered Mesoporous Carbons for Chemical Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered porous carbon was synthesized by microwave heating using Fe3O4 nanoparticles as hard templates. The microwave&#8208;assisted method reduces the reaction time and provides highly ordered structure with large surface area and nitrogen doping. NaAlH4 was confined into the pores of the carbon scaffold and the hydrogen sorption kinetics is improved by the synergistic effects of nanoconfinement and nitrogen doping.







Abstract
Ordered mesoporous carbon materials offer robust network of organized pores for energy storage and catalysis applications, but suffer from time&#8208;consuming and intricate preparations hindering their widespread use. Here we report a new and rapid synthetic route for a N&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous carbon structure through a preferential heating of iron oxide nanoparticles by microwaves. A nanoporous covalent organic polymer is first formed in situ covering the hard templates of assembled nanoparticles, paving the way for a long&#8208;range order in a carbonaceous nanocomposite precursor. Upon removal of the template, a well&#8208;defined cubic mesoporous carbon structure was revealed. The ordered mesoporous carbon was used in solid state hydrogen storage as a host scaffold for NaAlH4, where remarkable improvement in hydrogen desorption kinetics was observed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lowest activation energy of dehydrogenation as a single step was attributed to their ordered pore structure and N&#8208;doping effect.

Double the stoichiometry in radical recognition: A highly selective and efficient protocol, based on radical&#8208;pairing interactions, was developed for the recognition of two viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host.







Abstract
Complexation between a viologen radical cation (V.+) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (CBPQT2(.+)) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of a pair of V.+ using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (MV.+) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host &#8212; namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)2(.+), i.e., CBPQN2(.+). Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cations in CBPQN2(.+) suitable for binding two MV.+ with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25&#8197;&#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association with the two MV.+ in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex &#8212; namely, [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) &#8211; in MeCN was confirmed by VT 1H&#8197;NMR, as well as by EPR spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05&#8197;&#197;) between the three different V.+, suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two MV.+ inside the bisradical dicationic host. Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.

         <title>A Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/PSS Composite Membrane for Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)@PSS membranes with specific size exclusion and Li+ identification property show excellent mono/multi&#8208;valent ions separation performance. Compared with the traditional 2D membranes, the selectivity of Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Mg2+ through such membranes is five to ten times improved.







Abstract
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) laminar membrane with Li+ selective transport channels is obtained by stacking MXene nanosheets with the introduction of poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with active sulfonate sites, which exhibits excellent Li+ selectivity from ionic mixture solutions of Na+, K+, and Mg2+. The Li+ permeation rate through the MXene@PSS composite membrane is as high as 0.08&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the Li+/Mg2+, Li+/Na+, and Li+/K+ selectivities are 28, 15.5, and 12.7, respectively. Combining the simulation and experimental results, we further confirm that the highly selective rapid transport of partially dehydrated Li+ within subnanochannels can be attributed to the precisely controlled interlayer spacing and the relatively weaker ion&#8208;terminal (&#8722;SO3&#8722;) interaction. This study deepens the understanding of ion&#8208;selective permeation in confined channels and provides a general membrane design concept.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization by Hydromagnesiation: A Modular Strategy Towards N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylanilides to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The reaction, which usually occurs at room temperature over a short reaction time, employs an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron catalyst and EtMgBr as a hydride source. The breadth of this strategy was demonstrated by the synthesis of densely substituted indoles, oxindoles and novel tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolones, as well as the application towards the formal syntheses of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
A reductive cyclization to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, through the use of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides, is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron complex and generally occurs at ambient temperature. The transformation likely proceeds through hydromagnesiation of the vinyl group, and trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated benzylic anion by an intramolecular electrophile to form the heterocycle. This iron&#8208;catalyzed strategy was shown to be broadly applicable and was utilized in the synthesis of substituted indoles, oxindoles and tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolone derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicated that the reversibility of the hydride transfer step depends on the reactivity of the tethered electrophile. The synthetic utility of our approach was further demonstrated by the formal synthesis of a reported bioactive compound and a family of natural products.

         <title>Enantioselective Lactonization by &#960;&#8208;Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution: A Complement to &#960;&#8208;Allylmetal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective lactonization of unactivated allylic alcohols is reported under mild conditions. The transformation is catalyzed by a PdII&#8901;StackPhos complex and facilitates the substitution of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product without selectivity issues arising from racemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful method for the formation of highly useful, non&#8208;racemic allylic compounds. Here we present a complementary enantioselective process that generates allylic lactones via &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. More specifically, a catalytic enantioselective dehydrative lactonization of allylic alcohols using a novel PdII&#8208;catalyst containing the imidazole&#8208;based P,N&#8208;ligand (S)&#8208;StackPhos is reported. The high&#8208;yielding reactions are operationally simple to perform with enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. This strategy facilitates the replacement of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product avoiding complications arising from racemization by equilibration.

         <title>Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangements by Strain Release: Harnessing Primary Alkyl Radicals for Metal&#8208;Free Arylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement has proven to be a powerful tool for the synthesis of new sp3&#8208;aryls via ipso substitution. The reaction has been applied to the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes, giving cyanide&#8208;free access to &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles under metal&#8208;free, room temperature conditions. The reaction displays a wide scope of migrating arenes.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes enables easy generation of primary alkyl radicals, capable of undergoing an unprecedented strain&#8208;release, desulfonylative radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement, providing divergent access to valuable 1,3 diamines and unnatural &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Characterized by mild conditions and wide scope of migrating species, this protocol allows the modular assembly of sp3&#8208;aryls under transition metal&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <dc:description>
Shagene&#8197;A, which exhibits strong toxicity against Leishmania donovani, a protozoan that causes leishmaniasis, contains an intriguing strained structure that includes a multisubstituted cyclopropane. This study reports the first total synthesis of shagenes&#8197;A and B via Ru&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis of an enamide and Ir&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond isomerization of an alkylidenecyclopropane. The total synthesis suggested the absolute configuration of shagenes.







Abstract
We report the first total synthesis of shagenes&#8197;A and B, which are tricyclic terpenoids containing a cis&#8208;substituted cyclopropane, via ring&#8208;closing metathesis of an enamide and Ir&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond isomerization of an alkylidenecyclopropane. Chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity in the distorted cis&#8208;substituted structures were controlled by the alkylidenecyclopropane reactivity and using the ketone functionality as a remote directing group for the Ir catalyst, respectively. The total synthesis suggested the absolute configuration of shagenes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic Deracemization of Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deracemization is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but it is challenging owing to thermodynamic and kinetic barriers. Here we describe a method for deracemization of alcohols based on tandem photochemical dehydrogenation and thermal enantioselective hydrogenation, using light as the only driving force.

Deracemization of racemic chiral compounds is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but its development has been hindered by energetic and kinetic challenges. Here we describe a catalytic deracemization method for secondary benzylic alcohols which are important synthetic intermediates and end products for many industries. Driven by visible light only, this method is based on sequential photochemical dehydrogenation followed by enantioselective thermal hydrogenation. The combination of a heterogeneous dehydrogenation photocatalyst and a chiral molecular hydrogenation catalyst is essential to ensure two distinct pathways for the forward and reverse reactions. These reactions convert a large number of racemic aryl alkyl alcohols into their enantiomerically enriched forms in good yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Functionalized Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a fluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) was developed to suppress Li dendrite growth by realizing both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number. Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone reduce the mobility of Li salt anion and decrease the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains.







Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li) is regarded as the ideal anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low electrochemical potential, highest theoretical energy density and low density. There are, however, still significant challenges to be addressed such as Li&#8208;dendrite growth and low interfacial stability, which impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. In order to circumvent these shortcomings, herein, we present a gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a perfluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) to achieve both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number by fundamentally altering the solubility of salt within the gel electrolyte through Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone. Moreover, the presence of F&#8208;IL moieties decreased the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains, enabling a rapid transfer of Li cation within the gel network. These structural features enabled the immobilization of anions on the ionic liquid segments to alleviate the space&#8208;charge effect while promoting stronger anion coordination and weaker cation coordination in the Lewis&#8208;acidic polymers. Accordingly, we realized a high Li ion conductivity (9.16&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high Li ion transference number of 0.69 simultaneously, along with a good electrochemical stability up to 4.55&#8197;V, while effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte exhibited stable cycling performance of the Li|Li symmetric cell of 9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 1800&#8197;hours and retained 86.7&#8201;% of the original capacity after 250&#8197;cycles for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell.

         <title>Double Double to Double Perovskite Transformations in Quaternary Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal transformations under pressure of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with disordered A/A&#8242; cations are demonstrated for CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, leading to a dramatic switch in magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order to spin glass behaviour in the former.







Abstract
Control of cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8242; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO6 to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.

         <title>Engineering fluorophore recycling in a fluorogenic RNA aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic aptamers can potentially show minimal photobleaching during continuous irradiation since any photobleached fluorophore can exchange with fluorescent dyes in the media. However,&#160;fluorophores have not been designed to maximize &#8220;fluorophore recycling.&#8221;&#160;Here we describe TBI, a novel fluorophore for the Broccoli fluorogenic aptamer. Previous fluorophores either fail to rapidly dissociate when they undergo photobleaching via&#160;cis&#160;&#8208;&#160;trans&#160;isomerization, or bind slowly, resulting in extended periods after dissociation of the photobleached fluorophore when no fluorophore is bound. By contrast, photobleached TBI dissociates rapidly from Broccoli, and TBI from the media rapidly replaces dissociated photobleached fluorophore. Using TBI, Broccoli exhibits markedly enhanced fluorescence in cells during continuous imaging. These data show that designing fluorophores to optimize fluorophore recycling can lead to enhanced fluorescence of fluorogenic aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot Autonomously Walking on the Cell Membrane to Drive the Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic molecular robot can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control a cell to migrate. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise locomote on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner, simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion&#8208;and&#8208;operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. Together, we have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclopropanations via Enzyme&#8208;bound Iminium Ion Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane rings are an important structural motif frequently found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. Commonly, biocatalytic methodologies for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropanes rely on repurposed or artificial heme enzymes. Here, we engineered an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme based on a promiscuous tautomerase for the enantioselective synthesis of various cyclopropanes via the nucleophilic addition of diethyl 2chloromalonate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The engineered enzyme promotes formation of the two new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds with excellent stereocontrol over both stereocenters, affording the desired cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity (d.r. up to 25:1; e.r. up to 99:1). Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow Metal Sulfides via Cation Exchange Reactions for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we explore a general Cu  2&#8208;x  S nanocube template&#8208;assisted and   reverse  cation exchange&#8208;mediated growth strategy for fabricating  hollow multinary metal sulfide  . Impressively, different from the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to obtain a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructure has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as&#8208;synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag  2  S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS  2  , Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S), and quaternary compound (  single&#8208;atom platinum anchored  Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S; Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S&#8208;Pt  1  ). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductor obtained by stepwise reverse cation exchange can significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Owing to the efficient charge transfer, the Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S&#8208;Pt  1  exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance of CO  2  to CO, with the highest CO generation rate of 75.31&#8239;&#956;mol h  &#8722;1. Collectively, these versatile post&#8208;synthetic techniques demonstrate the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of sequential reverse cation exchange reactions to controllably access a vast variety of previously intractable hollow compositions for photocatalysis and another energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral TADF&#8208;Active Polymers for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy of chiral donor&#8208;acceptor copolymerization is proposed to develop chiral nonconjugated polymers with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Based on this strategy, two pairs of chiral polymers (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;/(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;  pTpAcDPS  and (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;/(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;  pTpAcBP  were synthesized. The alternating copolymerization of the chiral donors and acceptors could effectively separate the frontier molecular orbitals, which made the polymers show small &#916;  E  ST  of 0.01&#8208;0.03 eV and efficient TADF properties. Moreover, the polymers also showed the quantum yield of up to 92% and the circularly polarized luminescence. The solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showed circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 22.1% and maximum luminance of up to 34350 cd m  &#8208;2  . This is the first report of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral TADF polymer, which provides a useful and valuable guidance for the development of high&#8208;efficiency CPEL polymers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radical is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Flu&#8208;oromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally&#8208;stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoro&#8208;methylation of a variety of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into Structural Evolution, Active Site and Stability of Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure&#8208;activity correlation study of electrocatalysts is essential for improving conversion from electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidences obtained by  operando  characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes or reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize the structural evolution&#8208;related research advances and envisage their future developments. In this minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (  e.g.,  catalyst, active site/center and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple inducements of structural evolution and advanced  operando  characterizations are discussed. Lastly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis, especially for representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), along with key challenges and opportunities, is highlighted.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyperylenediimide (PDI) is always subject to its modest conductivities, limited reversible active sites and inferior stability for potassium storage. To well address the issues, herein, we firstly propose an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid (PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  T  x  ), where Fe/Sn single atoms are bound to the N&#8208;doped MXenes (N&#8208;Ti  3  C  2  T  x  )  via  the unsaturated Fe/Sn&#8208;N  3  bonds, and functionalized with PDI  via  d&#8208;&#960; hybridization, forming a high conjugated &#948; skeleton. The resulted hybrid cathode endowed with enhanced electronic/ionic conductivities, lowered dissociation barriers of multiple redox centers and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase layer displays a 14&#8208;electron involved high&#8208;rate capacities and long cycle life. Moreover, it shows competitive performance in full cells even under different folding states and low operating temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;cell generation of anticancer phenanthridine through bioorthogonal cyclization: a paradigm in antitumor prodrug development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmacological inactivation of antitumor drugs toward healthy cells is a critical factor in prodrug development. Typically, pharmaceutical chemists graft temporary moieties to existing antitumor drugs to reduce their pharmacological activity as much as possible. Here, we report a platform where the structure of the prodrug excludes the preexisting antitumor drug motif and is based on an inactive synthetic precursor able to generate the cytotoxic agent by bioorthogonal cyclization within a tumor environment. Using phenanthridines as cytotoxic model compounds, we designed ring&#8208;opened biaryl precursors that generated the phenanthridines through bioorthogonal irreversible imination. This reaction was triggered by reactive oxygen species, commonly overproduced in cancer cells, able to convert a vinyl boronate ester function into a ketone that subsequently reacted with a pendant aniline. An inactive precursor was shown to engender a cytotoxic phenanthridine against KB cancer cells. Moreover, the kinetic of cyclization of this prodrug was extremely rapid (&#706; 10 ms) inside living cells of KB cancer spheroids so as to circumvent drug action.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity NIR&#8208;II multiplexed lifetime bioimaging with bright double interfaced lanthanide nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of  in vivo  multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with short lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for  simultaneously  decoding  multiplexed lifetime  information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high&#8208;fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er  3+  doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er&#8208;DINPs): &#945;&#8208;NaYF  4  @NaErF  4  : Ce@NaYbF  4  @NaErF  4  : Ce@NaYF  4  with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime. Both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experimental results confirmed the advantage of these probes with comparable fluorescence intensity for high&#8208;fidelity multiplexed lifetime bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guanosine tetra&#8208; and pentaphosphate, (p)ppGpp, are important alarmone nucleotides that regulate bacterial survival in stressful environment. A direct detection of (p)ppGpp in living cells is critical for our understanding of the mechanism of bacterial stringent response. However, it is still challenging to image cellular (p)ppGpp. Here, we report RNA&#8208;based fluorescent sensors for the live&#8208;cell imaging of (p)ppGpp. Our sensors are engineered by conjugating a recently identified (p)ppGpp&#8208;specific riboswitch with a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, Broccoli. These sensors can be genetically encoded and enable direct monitoring of cellular (p)ppGpp accumulation. Unprecedented information on cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variation and cellular dynamics of (p)ppGpp levels is now obtained under different nutritional conditions. These RNA&#8208;based sensors can be broadly adapted to study bacterial stringent response.</dc:description>

         <title>A Family of Heterobimetallic Cubes Shows Spin&#8208;Crossover Behaviour Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple building blocks, six heterobimetallic cubes were obtained, following a straight&#8208;forward subcomponent self&#8208;assembly strategy. Three iron(II) based cages showed spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The crossover temperature was strongly dependent on interchangeable aldehyde components, giving rise to an efficient toolkit to manipulate magnetic behaviour.







Abstract
Using 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe8Pt6&#8208;cubes and their corresponding Zn8Pt6 analogues by employing the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The spin&#8208;transition temperature T1/2 depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin&#8208;crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4&#8208;thiazolecarbaldehyde or N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazole&#8208;carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin&#8208;crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1H&#8208;4&#8208;imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin&#8208;transition at low temperatures. Three new structures were characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and all structures were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>A Selection of Macrocyclic Peptides That Bind STING From an mRNA&#8208;Display Library With Split Degenerate Codons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;vitro selection of macrocyclic peptides from a library that uses a 25&#8208;amino&#8208;acid alphabet has allowed the identification of peptides that block binding of human STING to its natural ligand and induce dimerization of STING monomers. Our method splits multiple degenerate codons and reassigns them to non&#8208;natural amino acids.







Abstract
Recent improvements in mRNA display have enabled the selection of peptides that incorporate non&#8208;natural amino acids, thus expanding the chemical diversity of macrocycles beyond what is accessible in nature. Such libraries have incorporated non&#8208;natural amino acids at the expense of natural amino acids by reassigning their codons. Here we report an alternative approach to expanded amino&#8208;acid diversity that preserves all 19 natural amino acids (no methionine) and adds 6 non&#8208;natural amino acids, resulting in the highest sequence complexity reported to date. We have applied mRNA display to this 25&#8208;letter library to select functional macrocycles that bind human STING, a protein involved in immunoregulation. The resulting STING&#8208;binding peptides include a 9&#8208;mer macrocycle with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.4&#8197;nM, which blocks binding of cGAMP to STING and induces STING dimerization. This approach is generalizable to expanding the amino&#8208;acid alphabet in a library beyond 25 building blocks.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced frequency spectral method was developed to qualitative and spectral analysis of the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. This method decodes the frequency fingerprint from the highly noisy ionic current trace, which achieves classification, characterization, and prediction the ion interaction networks inside a nanopore.







Abstract
The transport of molecules and ions through biological nanopores is governed by interaction networks among restricted ions, transported molecules, and residue moieties at pore inner walls. However, identification of such weak ion fluctuations from only few tens of ions inside nanopore is hard to achieve owing to electrochemical measurement limitations. Here, we developed an advanced frequency method to achieve qualitative and spectral analysis of ion interaction networks inside a nanopore. The peak frequency fm reveals the dissociation rate between nanopore and ions; the peak amplitude am depicts the amount of combined ions with the nanopore after interaction equilibrium. A mathematical model for single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint achieved the prediction of interaction characteristics of mutant nanopores. This single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint is important for classification, characterization, and prediction of synergetic interaction networks inside nanoconfinement.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;Nitroindoles with Allyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates was reported. Good yields (up to 86&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates. Good yields (up to 86&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method. The kinetic experiments indicate that the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction is the nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide anion.

         <title>Influence of Intracrystalline Ionic Strength in MFI Zeolites on Aqueous Phase Dehydration of Methylcyclohexanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint. The individual TOFs depend on the substrate related mechanism (E1 vs. E2).







Abstract
The impact of the concentration of hydrated hydronium ions and in turn of the local ionic strength in MFI zeolites has been investigated for the aqueous phase dehydration of 4&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E1 mechanism) and cis&#8208;2&#8208;methylcyclohexanol (E2 mechanism). The E2 pathway with the latter alcohol led to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher activity. The catalytic activity normalized to the hydronium ions (turnover frequency, TOF) passed through a pronounced maximum, which is attributed to the increasing excess chemical potential of the alcohols in the pores, increasing in parallel with the ionic strength and the additional work caused by repulsive interactions and charge separation induced by the bulky alcohols. While the maximum in rate observed is invariant with the mechanism or substitution, the reaction pathway is influencing the activation parameters differently.

         <title>The Dimethylbismuth Cation: Entry Into Dative Bi&#8722;Bi Bonding and Unconventional Methyl Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimethyl bismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)], has been isolated and characterized. Reaction with BiMe3 allows access to the first compound featuring Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor bonding. In solution, dynamic behavior with methyl exchange via an unusual SE2 mechanism is observed, underlining the unique properties of bismuth species as soft Lewis acids with the ability to undergo reversible Bi&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
The isolation of simple, fundamentally important, and highly reactive organometallic compounds remains among the most challenging tasks in synthetic chemistry. The detailed characterization of such compounds is key to the discovery of novel bonding scenarios and reactivity. The dimethylbismuth cation, [BiMe2(SbF6)] (1), has been isolated and characterized. Its reaction with BiMe3 gives access to an unprecedented dative bond, a Bi&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. The exchange of methyl groups (arguably the simplest hydrocarbon moiety) between different metal atoms is among the most principal types of reactions in organometallic chemistry. The reaction of 1 with BiMe3 enables an SE2(back)&#8208;type methyl exchange, which is, for the first time, investigated in detail for isolable, (pseudo&#8208;)homoleptic main&#8208;group compounds.

         <title>Investigations of the Alignment Process of PBPMLG: 2H NMR Analysis Reveals a Thermoresponsive 90&#176; Flip of the Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 21040-21046, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated isotopologues of a thermoresponsive, glutamate&#8208;based alignment medium have been synthesized and investigated by 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry and polarized optical microscopy. The measurements show a flip of the polymeric &#945;&#8208;helix in lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, providing further insights into the alignment process of the polymer inside the magnetic field.







Abstract
The application of anisotropic parameters in NMR&#8208;spectroscopy enables the acquisition of spatial and angular information, complementary to those from conventional isotropic NMR&#8208;measurements. The use of alignment media is a well&#8208;established method for inducing anisotropy. PBPMLG is a recently discovered polyglutamate&#8208;based alignment medium, exhibiting thermoresponsive behavior in the lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) phase, thus offering potential for deeper understanding of the alignment process. We present one approach for investigating the thermoresponsive behavior by synthesizing specifically deuterated PBPMLG&#8208;isotopologues and their subsequent analyses using 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy. It was possible to relate the observed thermoresponsive behavior to a flip of the polymer with respect to the external magnetic field&#8212;an effect never observed before in glutamate&#8208;based polymeric alignment media. Furthermore, a solvent&#8208;induced temperature dependent gelation was verified in THF, which might provide yet another opportunity to manipulate the properties of this alignment medium in the future.

Bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) is explored as the cathode of aqueous Zn batteries, which contains both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties and exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p&#8208;type at low potential + p&#8208;type at high potential). With the benefit of the hybrid charge storage mode, the full cells exhibit high average voltage and capacity, and achieve long&#8208;life and supercapacitor&#8208;like high power.







Abstract
The p&#8208;type or n&#8208;type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n&#8208;type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&lt;0.8&#8197;V vs. Zn/Zn2+), while the p&#8208;type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Herein, we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) containing both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (n/p&#8208;type at low potential, p&#8208;type at high potential). Such a hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type reactions and compensates for the associated drawbacks of each. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn//PTD&#8208;1 full cell shows a high voltage (1.8&#8197;Vmaximum or 1.1&#8197;Vaverage), a high capacity 188.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPTD&#8208;1&#8722;1 (achieved at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), a long&#8208;life and a supercapacitor&#8208;like high power. These results shed new light on the design of advanced organic electrodes.

         <title>Exquisite Vesicular Nanomedicine by Paclitaxel Mediated Co&#8208;assembly with Camptothecin Prodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 21033-21039, September 13, 2021. </description>

An exquisite vesicular nanomedicine with ultrahigh drug loading content of paclitaxel (PTX) (up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;%) by a co&#8208;assembly strategy with another amphiphilic prodrug (Evans blue conjugated camptothecin, EB&#8208;CPT) is reported. The optimized ECX NVs exhibited a prominent synergistic effect between PTX and CPT against colorectal HCT116 cancer cells for improved combination therapy both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
We report that the self&#8208;assembly of drug amphiphiles, Evans blue conjugated camptothecin prodrug (EB&#8208;CPT), can be modulated by another anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), resulting in ultrahigh quality of nanovesicles (NVs) with uniform shape and diameters of around 80&#8197;nm with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, denoted as ECX NVs. Significantly, the co&#8208;assembly of EB&#8208;CPT and PTX without adding other excipients has nearly 100&#8201;% drug loading efficiency (DLE) and ultrahigh drug loading content (DLC) of PTX alone of up to 72.3&#177;1.7&#8197;wt&#8201;% which, to our best knowledge, is among the highest level reported in literature. Moreover, the ECX NVs with the EB&#8208;CPT:PTX weight ratio of 1:2 showed remarkable combination index of 0.59 at a level of 50&#8201;% efficacy against HCT116 cells in vitro and greatly improved tumor inhibition effect in vivo compared with two clinically approved CPT&#8208; and PTX&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines (Onivyde and Abraxane) individually and their combinations.

Unexpected isomerization of cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complexes, which formed through the first alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond, was observed with structural characterization of intermediates and products. Kinetic analysis for isomerization of isolated intermediate and detailed DFT calculations revealed a new elementary reaction, i.e., a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221; that contains anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination.







Abstract
This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8722;B bond of a di(o&#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221;, which can be considered as an anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step. Relative energies of the transition states to each isomer and natural&#8208;bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses were used to clearly rationalize the regiochemistry of the products.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Cadmium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst by Tuning of the Axial Coordination Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20803-20810, September 13, 2021. </description>

Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with an optimized CdN4S1 moiety were designed and prepared. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reached 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the TOF of CO production was as high as 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1. Cd SACs are effective for reduction of CO2 to CO. Introduction of an axial coordination structure boosts the activity of CO2RR and also enhances the selectivity of CO2RR by suppressing the adsorption of *H.







Abstract
Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, it was found that Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have excellent performance in activating CO2, and the introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2 reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1 moiety incorporated in a carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type electrolysis cell, and the turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was much higher than that reported to date. This work shows a successful example of how to design highly efficient catalysts guided by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic Cofactor Regeneration Coupled to CO2 Fixation in a Redox&#8208;Active Hydrogel for Stereoselective C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 21056-21061, September 13, 2021. </description>

Electrified CO2 fixation switched on! In a bioelectrocatalytic approach an NADPH recycling module and a C&#8722;C bond formation module were co&#8208;immobilized within a viologen&#8208;based redox hydrogel. This enabled the regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO2 into crotonyl&#8208;CoA, yielding the most complex product known in bioelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion so far.







Abstract
The sustainable capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) is key to achieving a circular carbon economy. Bioelectrocatalysis, which aims at using renewable energies to power the highly specific, direct transformation of CO2 into value added products, holds promise to achieve this goal. However, the functional integration of CO2&#8208;fixing enzymes onto electrode materials for the electrosynthesis of stereochemically complex molecules remains to be demonstrated. Here, we show the electricity&#8208;driven regio&#8208; and stereoselective incorporation of CO2 into crotonyl&#8208;CoA by an NADPH&#8208;dependent enzymatic reductive carboxylation. Co&#8208;immobilization of a ferredoxin NADP+ reductase and crotonyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase/reductase within a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;viologen&#8208;modified hydrogel enabled iterative NADPH recycling and stereoselective formation of (2S)&#8208;ethylmalonyl&#8208;CoA, a prospective intermediate towards multi&#8208;carbon products from CO2, with 92&#177;6&#8201;% faradaic efficiency and at a rate of 1.6&#177;0.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This approach paves the way for realizing even more complex bioelectrocatalyic cascades in the future.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20849-20857, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIPs for protein recognition are often synthesized by the epitope approach. The epitope is a short surface&#8208;exposed peptide of the protein. Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies were used to prove the evidence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of the peptide epitope in the corresponding MIP nanogel. No binding was observed with a non&#8208;related peptide.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8220;synthetic antibody&#8221; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer&#8208;based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8220;best&#8221; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis&#8197;A Virus Cell Receptor&#8208;1 protein, also known as KIM&#8208;1 and TIM&#8208;1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven and Enzyme&#8208;Regulated Redox&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>

A fuel&#8208;driven and enzyme&#8208;regulated supramolecular hydrogel has the inherent ability to tune its behavior from a redox&#8208;responsive to a self&#8208;regulating system. Feedback arises due to in situ formation of oxidation fuel in the chemical reaction network.







Abstract
Chemical reaction networks (CRN) embedded in hydrogels can transform responsive materials into complex self&#8208;regulating materials that generate feedback to counter the effect of external stimuli. This study presents hydrogels containing the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) and ferrocene (Fc) host&#8211;guest pair as supramolecular crosslinks where redox&#8208;responsive behavior is driven by the enzyme&#8211;fuel couples horse radish peroxidase (HRP)&#8211;H2O2 and glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8211;d&#8208;glucose. The hydrogel can be tuned from a responsive to a self&#8208;regulating supramolecular system by varying the concentration of added reduction fuel d&#8208;glucose. The onset of self&#8208;regulating behavior is due to formation of oxidation fuel in the hydrogel by a cofactor intermediate GOx[FADH2]. UV/Vis spectroscopy, rheology, and kinetic modeling were employed to understand the emergence of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior and reveal the programmable negative feedback response of the hydrogel, including the adaptation of its elastic modulus and its potential as a glucose sensor.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Liquids for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion</title>

An ionization strategy has been developed to fabricate a porous MOF liquid, which shows large adsorption of CO2. The adsorbed CO2 can subsequently be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize, for example, cyclic carbonates.







Abstract
The unique applications of porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) liquids with permanent porosity and fluidity have attracted significant attention. However, fabrication of porous MOF liquids remains challenging because of the easy intermolecular self&#8208;filling of the cavity or the rapid settlement of porous hosts in hindered solvents that cannot enter their pores. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a MOF liquid (Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL) by surface ionization of an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized framework with a sterically hindered poly(ethylene glycol) sulfonate (PEGS) canopy. The Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL obtained in this way has a CO2 adsorption approximately 14 times larger than that of pure PEGS. Distinct from a porous MOF solid counterpart, the stored CO2 in Im&#8208;UiO&#8208;PL can be slowly released and efficiently utilized to synthesize cyclic carbonates in the atmosphere. This is the first example of the use of a porous MOF liquid as a CO2 storage material for catalysis. It offers a new method for the fabrication of unique porous liquid MOFs with functional behaviors in various fields of gas adsorption and catalysis.

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesized Catalyst towards Acidic Oxygen Reduction by Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20865-20871, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst possessing well&#8208;defined active sites and intrinsic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by a pyrolysis&#8208;free route. The performance of the catalyst was explored in acidic media by introducing a deprotonation process.







Abstract
Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;Acidic oxygen reduction is vital for renewable energy devices such as fuel cells. However, many aspects of the catalytic process are still uncertain&#8212;especially the large difference in activity in acidic and alkaline media. Thus, the design and synthesis of model catalysts to determine the active centers and the inactivation mechanism are urgently needed. We report a pyrolysis-free synthesis route to fabricate a catalyst (CPF-Fe@NG) for oxygen reduction in acidic conditions. By introducing a deprotonation process, we extended the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity from alkaline to acidic conditions. CPF-Fe@NG demonstrated outstanding performance with a half-wave potential of 853&#8197;mV (vs. RHE) and good stability after 10000&#8197;cycles in 1&#8197;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The pyrolysis-free route could also be used to assemble fuel cells, with a maximum power density of 126&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8211;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>

Beyond C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavage: We report reductive cleavages of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions by electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. Deoxygenations as well as E&#8208; or Z&#8208;selective olefinations are reported. Surprisingly, reactions tolerate C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavages such as aryl halides. Radical ion catalyst&#8208;substrate preassembly is key in enabling reactivity and overturning conventional redox chemoselectivity.







Abstract
We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are E&#8208;selective and can be made Z&#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation, and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for an intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp3)&#8722;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded Hollow Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid: Explicitly Recognizing the Void&#8208;Confinement Effect</title>

The void&#8208;confinement effect of metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres as synthetic nanoreactors is explicitly recognized as an integrating effect involving electronic metal&#8211;support interactions, reactant enrichment, and diffusion. These findings provide insights for comprehending microenvironment effects of hollow carbon nanostructures in biomass hydrogenation applications.







Abstract
As a typical class of man&#8208;made nanoreactors, metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void&#8208;confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance. Herein this paper, Ru&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres are employed as nanoreactors with a crucial biomass hydrogenation process, levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation into &#947;&#8208;valerolactone, as the probe reaction to further recognize the forming mechanism of this pivotal effect. We demonstrated that the void&#8208;confinement effect of the selected MHC nanoreactors is essentially driven by an integrating action of electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, reactant enrichment and diffusion, which are mainly ascribed to peculiar properties of hollow nanoreactors both in electronic and structural aspects, respectively. This work offers a distinct case for interpreting the catalytic behaviour of MHC nanoreactors, which could potentially promise broader insights into the microenvironment engineering strategies of hollow nanostructures.

         <title>Unravelling the Hydration Barrier of Lignin Oleate Nanoparticles for Acid&#8208; and Base&#8208;Catalyzed Functionalization in Dispersion State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20897-20905, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) are demonstrated for functionalization in aqueous dispersion under acidic (pH&#8197;2) and basic (pH&#8197;12) conditions owing to the hydration barrier effect provided by oleic acid chains in the shells of OLNPs. Covalent functionalization of these nanoparticles using robust chemistries opens new avenues such as functional anticorrosive coatings and pH&#8208;switchable adsorbents for removal of organic dyes from wastewater.







Abstract
Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) are promising renewable nanomaterials with applications ranging from biomedicine to water purification. However, the instability of LNPs under acidic and basic conditions severely limits their functionalization for improved performance. Here, we show that controlling the degree of esterification can significantly improve the stability of lignin oleate nanoparticles (OLNPs) in acidic and basic aqueous dispersions. The high stability of OLNPs is attributed to the alkyl chains accumulated in the shell of the particle, which delays protonation/deprotonation of carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Owing to the enhanced stability, acid&#8208; and base&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of OLNPs at pH&#8197;2.0 and pH&#8197;12.0 via oxirane ring&#8208;opening reactions were successfully performed. We also demonstrated these new functionalized particles as efficient pH&#8208;switchable dye adsorbents and anticorrosive particulate coatings.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

An oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;X nanosheet is developed as a novel free radical regulator. It shows dual&#8208;modal free radical catalysis adaptive to environment changes, enabling amplified production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions, while scavenging free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells.







Abstract
Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically, the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.

         <title>Single Dynamic Covalent Bond Tailored Responsive Molecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20872-20878, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecular devices based on dynamic covalent chemistry were fabricated, and the conductance measurement shows that three well&#8208;defined conductance states were observed with an ON/OFF ratio &#8776;10 in response to acid&#8208;based or photo&#8208;thermal stimuli of dynamic acyl hydrazone bond, while the ON&#8208;OFF ratio is &#8776;3 in self&#8208;assembled monolayer devices, which originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization.







Abstract
Responsive molecular devices are one of the core units for molecular electronics, and dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) provide the opportunity for the fabrication of responsive molecular devices. Herein we employ a single dynamic acyl hydrazone bond to fabricate tailored molecular devices using the scanning tunneling microscopy break&#8208;junction technique (STM&#8208;BJ) and the eutectic Ga&#8208;In technique (EGaIn). We found that the single&#8208;DCB&#8208;tailored molecular devices exhibited acid&#8208;base and/or photo&#8208;thermal response with three well&#8208;defined molecular conductance states. The reversible switching has the ON/OFF ratio of &#8776;10 between each state for single&#8208;molecule junctions and &#8776;3 for the SAMs&#8208;based molecular junctions. Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we revealed that the multiple conductance states of these molecular junctions originate from the dynamic acyl hydrazone bond exchange and C=N isomerization. Our work opens the avenue towards the design of tailored single&#8208;molecule electrical devices by implanting dynamic covalent bonds in molecular architectures.

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20811-20816, September 13, 2021. </description>

A modified carbon nitride with O&#8208;containing linkers decorated with carbon dots selectively produces methanol from CO2 and water with the benchmark quantum yield of ca. 6&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectroscopic investigation shows that extraction of holes before trapping by the carbon dots is key for the remarkable performance.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO2 is still unsatisfactory owing to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 is reduced to methanol with 100&#8201;% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) is 300&#8201;% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT could be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75&#8201;% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.

Acid dissolution enables 3D image reconstruction of coccoliths, providing mass estimation in the range of 2 to 400&#8197;picograms.







Abstract
Coccoliths are plates of biogenic calcium carbonate secreted by calcifying marine phytoplankton; annually these phytoplankton are responsible for exporting &gt;1 billion tonnes (1015&#8197;g) of calcite to the deep ocean. Rapid and reliable methods for assessing the degree of calcification are technically challenging because the coccoliths are micron sized and contain picograms (pg) of calcite. Here we pioneer an opto&#8208;eletrochemical acid titration of individual coccoliths which allows 3D reconstruction of each individual coccolith via in situ optical imaging enabling direct inference of the coccolith mass. Coccolith mass ranging from 2 to 400&#8197;pg are reported herein, evidencing both inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;species variation over four different species. We foresee this scientific breakthrough, which is independent of knowledge regarding the species and calibration&#8208;free, will allow continuous monitoring and reporting of the degree of coccolith calcification in the changing marine environment.

The solution structure of quadruplex&#8208;lateral duplex hybrid (QLDH) MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex shows that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G4&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, displaying a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;dependent DNA secondary structures possess structure polymorphism. To date, studies on regulated ligands mainly focus on individual DNA secondary topologies, while lack focus on quadruplex&#8211;duplex hybrids (QDHs). Here, we design an organic&#8211;metal hybrid ligand L1Pt(dien), which matches and selectively binds one type of QDHs with lateral duplex stem&#8208;loop (QLDH) with high affinity, while shows poor affinity for other QDHs and individual G4 or duplex DNA. The solution structure of QLDH MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex was determined by NMR. The structure reveals that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, showing a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode. Our work provided guidance for spatial matching design of selectively targeting ligands to QDH structures.

         <title>In Vivo Tracking of Cell Viability for Adoptive Natural Killer Cell&#8208;Based Immunotherapy by Ratiometric NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20888-20896, September 13, 2021. </description>

Using a ROS&#8208;sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence probe to label NK cells was reported for tracking cell viability in adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy. Intracellular ROS generation of dying NK cells, caused by exogenous physical or chemical factors, such as hypoxia, starvation, and oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment, results in a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal in vivo, which holds considerable potential for adoptive NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy of natural killer (NK) cells&#8208;based immunotherapy is greatly related with the survival of transplanted NK cells. However, no effective strategy was reported to monitor NK cell viability in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo. Herein, we develop a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging strategy to quantitively track and visualize the adoptive NK cell viability in vivo in real&#8208;time. The nanoprobe consists of lanthanide&#8208;based down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP) coated with IR786s, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to NIR dye, which was directly labeled with NK cells. Upon cell death, the excessive ROS generation occurred within NK cells, along with IR786s degradation, turning on NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 808&#8208;nm excitation, while the fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 980&#8208;nm excitation was stable. Such an intracellular ROS&#8208;induced ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent signal was validated to correlate well with NK cell viability in vivo. Using this nanoreporter, we further demonstrated that co&#8208;treatment with IL&#8208;2, IL&#8208;15, and IL&#8208;21 could improve NK cell viability in vivo, achieving enhanced immunotherapy for orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this strategy allows for longitudinal and quantitative tracking of NK cell viability in NK cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic efficacy of natural killer (NK) cells-based immunotherapy is greatly related with the survival of transplanted NK cells. However, no effective strategy was reported to monitor NK cell viability in adoptive immunotherapy in vivo. Herein, we develop a ratiometric NIR-II fluorescence imaging strategy to quantitively track and visualize the adoptive NK cell viability in vivo in real-time. The nanoprobe consists of lanthanide-based down-conversion nanoparticles (DCNP) coated with IR786s, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to NIR dye, which was directly labeled with NK cells. Upon cell death, the excessive ROS generation occurred within NK cells, along with IR786s degradation, turning on NIR-II fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 808-nm excitation, while the fluorescent signal at 1550&#8197;nm of DCNP under 980-nm excitation was stable. Such an intracellular ROS-induced ratiometric NIR-II fluorescent signal was validated to correlate well with NK cell viability in vivo. Using this nanoreporter, we further demonstrated that co-treatment with IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 could improve NK cell viability in vivo, achieving enhanced immunotherapy for orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, this strategy allows for longitudinal and quantitative tracking of NK cell viability in NK cell-based immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Proximity Aptasensing for Cell&#8208;Surface Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Apoptosis</title>

The logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform responds to cell environmental factors (H+ and K+) to manipulate a proximity aptasensor for the real&#8208;time monitoring of chemotherapeutics&#8208;induced cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP when it is anchored on the cell surface.







Abstract
In nature, intact apoptotic cells release ATP as a signaling molecule to trigger prompt phagocytic clearance, even at the earliest stage of apoptosis. Inspired by this, here we introduce a straightforward strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring ATP exocytosis and drug&#8208;stimulated apoptosis in the cancer cell surroundings. Triplex&#8208;boosted G&#8208;quadruplexes (tb&#8208;G4s) responding to cell environmental factors (H+ and K+) are engineered to construct a DNA logic&#8208;gated nanoplatform for proximity ATP aptasensing on the cell surface. It enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of cell apoptosis by capturing released endogenous ATP during chemotherapy drug stimulation, providing a sensitive approach for dynamically evaluating drug&#8208;induced apoptosis and therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Boosting Photoacoustic Effect via Intramolecular Motions Amplifying Thermal&#8208;to&#8208;Acoustic Conversion Efficiency for Adaptive Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>

A compound with intense intramolecular motions exhibits an amplified photoacoustic signal by specifically elevating the thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency, and the fluorescence brightness also increases due to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. Precise in vivo image&#8208;guided cancer surgery in different stages is conducted, greatly boosting the surgery outcome.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging emerges as a promising technique for biomedical applications. The development of new strategies to boost PA conversion without depressing other properties (e.g., fluorescence) is highly desirable for multifunctional imaging but difficult to realize. Here, we report a new phenomenon that active intramolecular motions could promote PA signal by specifically increasing thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion efficiency. The compound with intense intramolecular motion exhibits amplified PA signal by elevating thermal&#8208;to&#8208;acoustic conversion, and the fluorescence also increases due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission signature. The simultaneously high PA and fluorescence brightness of TPA&#8208;TQ3 NPs enable precise image&#8208;guided surgery. The preoperative fluorescence and PA imaging are capable of locating orthotopic breast tumor in a high&#8208;contrast manner, and the intraoperative fluorescence imaging delineates tiny residual tumors. This study highlights a new design guideline of intramolecular motion amplifying PA effect.

         <title>Advection&#8208;Enhanced Kinetics in Microtiter Plates for Improved Surface Assay Quantitation and Multiplexing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20935-20942, September 13, 2021. </description>

Flat solid&#8208;phase assays form the basis of modern medical diagnosis and continue to drive pioneering biological questions. Here, we bring micro&#8208;scale advection to these assays, thereby improving their sensitivity, time to results, multiplexing and information per test. We do this in standard microtiter plates, compatible with hundreds of commercially available kits for surface assay applications.







Abstract
Surface assays such as ELISA are pervasive in clinics and research and predominantly standardized in microtiter plates (MTP). MTPs provide many advantages but are often detrimental to surface assay efficiency due to inherent mass transport limitations. Microscale flows can overcome these and largely improve assay kinetics. However, the disruptive nature of microfluidics with existing labware and protocols has narrowed its transformative potential. We present WellProbe, a novel microfluidic concept compatible with MTPs. With it, we show that immunoassays become more sensitive at low concentrations (up to 9&#215; signal improvement in 12&#215; less time), richer in information with 3&#8211;4 different kinetic conditions, and can be used to estimate kinetic parameters, minimize washing steps and non&#8208;specific binding, and identify compromised results. We further multiplex single&#8208;well assays combining WellProbe's kinetic regions with tailored microarrays. Finally, we demonstrate our system in a context of immunoglobulin subclass evaluation, increasingly regarded as clinically relevant.

Using single&#8208;molecule optical tweezers and confocal microscopy we perform kinetic analysis of a novel dinuclear ruthenium(II) DNA imaging probe. Reversable binding is observed on relaxed DNA, however on stretching DNA, threading can occur, resulting in high affinity stable binding. Threading is highly stereoisomer specific and dependent on DNA supercoiling state. This DNA probe has exciting potential for DNA structure specific imaging.







Abstract
Threading intercalators bind DNA with high affinities. Here, we describe single&#8208;molecule studies on a cell&#8208;permeant luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complex that has been previously shown to thread only into short, unstable duplex structures. Using optical tweezers and confocal microscopy, we show that this complex threads and locks into force&#8208;extended duplex DNA in a two&#8208;step mechanism. Detailed kinetic studies reveal that an individual stereoisomer of the complex exhibits the highest binding affinity reported for such a mono&#8208;intercalator. This stereoisomer better preserves the biophysical properties of DNA than the widely used SYTOX Orange. Interestingly, threading into torsionally constrained DNA decreases dramatically, but is rescued on negatively supercoiled DNA. Given the &#8220;light&#8208;switch&#8221; properties of this complex on binding DNA, it can be readily used as a long&#8208;lived luminescent label for duplex or negatively supercoiled DNA through a unique &#8220;load&#8208;and&#8208;lock&#8221; protocol.

         <title>Origin of the &#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20840-20848, September 13, 2021. </description>

The &#945;&#8208;effect explained! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal the intrinsic factors that &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles need to exhibit &#945;&#8208;effect. The origin is traced back to a small HOMO lobe to reduce the destabilizing Pauli repulsion, and a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable orbital overlap.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles (R&#8722;Y&#8722;X:&#8722;) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8722;X:&#8722;) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type reactivity&#8208;basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the &#945;&#8208;effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including O&#8208;, N&#8208; and S&#8208;based normal and &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an &#945;&#8208;nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show &#945;&#8208;effect: (i)&#8197;a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii)&#8197;a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap.

     alt="Origin of the &#945;-Effect in SN2 Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#945;-effect explained! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal the intrinsic factors that &#945;-nucleophiles need to exhibit &#945;-effect. The origin is traced back to a small HOMO lobe to reduce the destabilizing Pauli repulsion, and a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable orbital overlap.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#945;-effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of &#945;-nucleophiles (R&#8722;Y&#8722;X:&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R&#8722;X:&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by deviating from the classical Br&#248;nsted-type reactivity-basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the &#945;-effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-based normal and &#945;-nucleophiles, participating in an S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an &#945;-nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show &#945;-effect: (i)&#8197;a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied&#8211;occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii)&#8197;a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no &#945;-effect or inverse &#945;-effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unmasking Steps in Intramolecular Aromatic Hydroxylation by a Synthetic Nonheme Oxoiron(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20991-20998, September 13, 2021. </description>

The nonheme FeIV=O complex 2&#8208;syn (in green circle) can be generated from the reaction of its precursor [FeII(Bn3MC)]2+ (1) with an oxo&#8208;transfer agent. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8208;syn decays to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr oxidation product 3 (in blue circle) and regenerates its FeII(Bn3MC)2+ precursor (in red circle) in a 2:1 ratio. This observed stoichiometry demonstrates for the first time the electron flow required to effect this novel transformation.







Abstract
In this study, a methyl group on the classic tetramethylcyclam (TMC) ligand framework is replaced with a benzylic group to form the metastable [FeIV(Osyn)(Bn3MC)]2+ (2&#8208;syn; Bn3MC=1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) species at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The decay of 2&#8208;syn with time at 25&#8201;&#176;C allows the unprecedented monitoring of the steps involved in the intramolecular hydroxylation of the ligand phenyl ring to form the major FeIII&#8722;OAr product 3. At the same time, the FeII(Bn3MC)2+ (1) precursor to 2&#8208;syn is re&#8208;generated in a 1:2 molar ratio relative to 3, accounting for the first time for all the electrons involved and all the Fe species derived from 2&#8208;syn as shown in the following balanced equation: 3&#8201;[FeIV(O)(LPh)]2+ (2&#8208;syn)&#8594;2&#8201;[FeIII(LOAr)]2+ (3)+[FeII(LPh)]2+ (1)+H2O. This system thus serves as a paradigm for aryl hydroxylation by FeIV=O oxidants described thus far. It is also observed that 2&#8208;syn can be intercepted by certain hydrocarbon substrates, thereby providing a means to assess the relative energetics of aliphatic and aromatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation in this system.

         <title>Energy Platform for Directed Charge Transfer in the Cascade Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction: CO2 Photoreduction without a Cocatalyst</title>

A cascade Z&#8208;Scheme system composed of a dimension&#8208;matched (001)TiO2&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4/BiVO4 heterojunction is proposed, in which the energy platform (001)TiO2 is used to direct charge transfer and separation, thus blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway. The role of TiO2 is thus not only to facilitate the Z&#8208;Scheme charge transfer but also to maintain the strong redox potentials for CO2 photoreduction and water splitting.







Abstract
A universal strategy is developed to construct a cascade Z&#8208;Scheme system, in which an effective energy platform is the core to direct charge transfer and separation, blocking the unexpected type&#8208;II charge transfer pathway. The dimension&#8208;matched (001)TiO2&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4/BiVO4 nanosheet heterojunction (T&#8208;CN/BVNS) is the first such model. The optimized cascade Z&#8208;Scheme exhibits &#8776;19&#8208;fold photoactivity improvement for CO2 reduction to CO in the absence of cocatalysts and costly sacrificial agents under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with BVNS, which is also superior to other reported Z&#8208;Scheme systems even with noble metals as mediators. The experimental results and DFT calculations based on van der Waals structural models on the ultrafast timescale reveal that the introduced T as the platform prolongs the lifetimes of spatially separated electrons and holes and does not compromise their reduction and oxidation potentials.

The exocytosis&#8208;inspired behaviour was demonstrated in a temperature sensitive hybrid bi&#8208;microcompartment system. Due to the universal loading capacity and excellent biocompatibility, the proliferation and temperature&#8208;programmed fast release of living cells were realized, which provided a robust platform for the on&#8208;demand transportation of various living organisms.







Abstract
Inspired by the unique characteristics of living cells, the creation of life&#8208;inspired functional ensembles is a rapidly expanding research topic, enabling transformative applications in various disciplines. Herein, we report a facile method for the fabrication of phospholipid and block copolymer hybrid bi&#8208;microcompartments via spontaneous asymmetric assembly at the water/tributyrin interface, whereby the temperature&#8208;mediated dewetting of the inner microcompartments allowed for exocytosis to occur in the constructed system. The exocytosis location and commencement time could be controlled by the buoyancy of the inner microcompartment and temperature, respectively. Furthermore, the constructed bi&#8208;microcompartments showed excellent biocompatibility and a universal loading capacity toward cargoes of widely ranging sizes; thus, the proliferation and temperature&#8208;programmed transportation of living organisms was achieved. Our results highlight opportunities for the development of complex mesoscale dynamic ensembles with life&#8208;inspired behaviors and provide a novel platform for on&#8208;demand transport of various living organisms.

         <title>Ultralow Volume Change of P2&#8208;Type Layered Oxide Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20960-20969, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and distribution of Na ions retained in lattice are two internal factors which affect structural evolution. Na ions can support the lattice structure like pillars, by regulating the distribution of Na ions, the process of phase transition can be controlled. As a result, the cathode can offer as high capacity as possible without obvious phase transition.







Abstract
Most P2&#8208;type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further leads to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na2/3MnxNix&#8722;1/3Co4/3&#8722;2xO2 (1/3&#8804;x&#8804;2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2&#8208;Na2/3Mn1/2Ni1/6Co1/3O2 cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#8197;V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9&#8201;%. Such a low strain is beneficial for cycling stability.

     alt="Ultralow Volume Change of P2-Type Layered Oxide Cathode for Na-Ion Batteries with Controlled Phase Transition by Regulating Distribution of Na+"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number and distribution of Na ions retained in lattice are two internal factors which affect structural evolution. Na ions can support the lattice structure like pillars, by regulating the distribution of Na ions, the process of phase transition can be controlled. As a result, the cathode can offer as high capacity as possible without obvious phase transition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most P2-type layered oxides exhibit a large volume change when they are charged into high voltage, and it further leads to bad structural stability. In fact, high voltage is not the reason which causes the irreversible phase transition. There are two internal factors which affect structural evolution: the amount and distribution of Na ions retained in the lattice. Hereon, a series of layered oxides Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4/3&#8722;2&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1/3&#8804;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;2/3) were synthesized. It is observed that different components have different structural evolutions during the charge/discharge processes, and further researches find that the distribution of Na ions in layers is the main factor. By controlling the distribution of Na ions, the phase transition process can be well controlled. As the referential component, P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with uniform distribution of Na ions is cycled at the voltage window of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#8197;V, which exhibits a volume change as low as 1.9&#8201;%. Such a low strain is beneficial for cycling stability. The current work provides a new and effective route to regulate the structural evolution of the promising P2-type layered cathode for sodium ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Enhancement of Magnetic Resonance Signals Using a RASER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20984-20990, September 13, 2021. </description>

We introduce the combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER and spontaneous polarization transfer: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal.







Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance is usually drastically limited by its intrinsically low sensitivity: Only a few spins contribute to the overall signal. To overcome this limitation, hyperpolarization methods were developed that increase signals several times beyond the normal/thermally polarized signals. The ideal case would be a universal approach that can signal enhance the complete sample of interest in solution to increase detection sensitivity. Here, we introduce a combination of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced magnetic resonance with the phenomenon of the RASER: Large signals of para&#8208;hydrogen enhanced molecules interact with the magnetic resonance coil in a way that the signal is spontaneously converted into an in&#8208;phase signal. These molecules directly interact with other compounds via dipolar couplings and enhance their signal. We demonstrate that this is not only possible for solvent molecules but also for an amino acid.

A high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8211;organic battery using a nonflammable organic electrolyte shows a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading of 16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the cathode and high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%) in the anode. TFMS=trifluoromethanesulfonate, TEP=triethyl phosphate, PC=propylene carbonate.







Abstract
Owing to undesired Zn corrosion and the formation of Zn dendrites in aqueous electrolytes, most of the examples of aqueous Zn batteries with reported excellent performance are achieved with low Zn&#8208;utilization (&lt;0.6&#8201;%) in the anode and low mass&#8208;loading (&lt;3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the cathode. Herein, we propose a new organic electrolyte for Zn batteries, which contains a zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn&#8208;TFMS) salt and a mixed solvent consisting of propylene carbonate (PC) and triethyl phosphate (TEP). We demonstrate that this electrolyte with an optimized PC/TEP ratio not only exhibits high ionic conductivity and a wide stable potential window, but also facilitates dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping. In particular, the TEP solvent makes the electrolyte nonflammable. Finally, a 2&#8197;V Zn//polytriphenylamine composite (PTPAn) battery is fabricated with the optimized electrolyte; it shows a high rate and a long lifetime (2400&#8197;cycles) even with a high mass&#8208;loading (16&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of PTPAn in the cathode and with a high Zn&#8208;utilization (3.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Radical Stabilization of a Tripyridinium&#8211;Triazine Molecule Enables Reversible Storage of Multiple Electrons</title>

A tripyridinium&#8211;triazine molecule featuring multiple redox centers was developed with a capacity as high as six electrons per molecule. The electronic coupling between the pyridinium and triazine units can effectively delocalize the charge of the radicals, thereby stabilizing the reactive intermediate and enabling reversible storage of multiple electrons.







Abstract
A novel organic molecule, 2,4,6&#8208;tris[1&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridiniumyl]&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine hexachloride, was developed as a reversible six&#8208;electron storage electrolyte for use in an aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB). Physicochemical characterization reveals that the molecule evolves from a radical to a biradical and finally to a quinoid structure upon accepting four electrons. Both the diffusion coefficient and the rate constant were sufficiently high to run a flow battery with low concentration and kinetics polarization losses. In a demonstration unit, the assembled flow battery affords a high specific capacity of 33.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 and a peak power density of 273&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the rational design of electroactive organics that can manipulate multi&#8208;electron transfer in a reversible way, which will pave the way to development of energy&#8208;dense, manageable and low&#8208;cost ARFBs.

Towards the development of sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts, low&#8208;symmetry metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages assembled from unsymmetrical ligands are of emerging interest. Designing systems to avoid forming isomeric mixtures, however, is challenging. We report the use of a rapid computational workflow to predict self&#8208;assembly outcomes, informing experimental decisions and optimising synthetic realisation of low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.







Abstract
Unsymmetrical ditopic ligands can self&#8208;assemble into reduced&#8208;symmetry Pd2L4 metallo&#8208;cages with anisotropic cavities, with implications for high specificity and affinity guest&#8208;binding. Mixtures of cage isomers can form, however, resulting in undesirable system heterogeneity. It is paramount to be able to design components that preferentially form a single isomer. Previous data suggested that computational methods could predict with reasonable accuracy whether unsymmetrical ligands would preferentially self&#8208;assemble into single cage isomers under constraints of geometrical mismatch. We successfully apply a collaborative computational and experimental workflow to mitigate costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error synthetic approaches. Our rapid computational workflow constructs unsymmetrical ligands and their Pd2L4 cage isomers, ranking the likelihood for exclusively forming cis&#8208;Pd2L4 assemblies. From this narrowed search space, we successfully synthesised four new, low&#8208;symmetry, cis&#8208;Pd2L4 cages.

         <title>A Highly Selective Supramolecule Array Membrane Made of Zero&#8208;Dimensional Molecules for Gas Separation</title>

2&#8208;Methylimidazole (mim) molecules were assembled into unprecedented supramolecule array membranes (SAMs) through vapor processing on closely packed MOF layers. Selective gas transport through the intermolecular spacing of mim (ca. 0.30&#8197;nm) is realized within SAMs, yielding an extremely precise sieving of H2 from CO2.







Abstract
We orderly assembled zero&#8208;dimensional 2&#8208;methylimidazole (mim) molecules into unprecedented supramolecule array membranes (SAMs) through solvent&#8208;free vapor processing, realizing the intermolecular spacing of mim at ca. 0.30&#8197;nm available as size&#8208;sieving channels for distinguishing the tiny difference between H2 (kinetic diameter: 0.289&#8197;nm) and CO2 (kinetic diameter: 0.33&#8197;nm). The highly oriented and dense membranes yield a separation factor above 3600 for equimolar H2/CO2 mixtures, which is one order of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes defining 2017&#8217;s upper bound for H2/CO2 separation. These SAMs define a new benchmark for molecular sieve membranes and are of paramount importance to precombustion carbon capture. Given the range of supramolecules, we anticipate SAMs with variable intermolecular channels could be applied in diversified separations that are prevalent in chemical processes.

         <title>Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Hydrogen Bonds as Design Principle in Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 21014-21024, September 13, 2021. </description>

Experimental and computational studies on PPh3 and PCy3&#8208;substituted ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines as well as on a biaryl and a cyclohexyl&#8208;aryl phosphine demonstrate that Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds can serve as secondary metal ligand interactions similar to gold&#8211;arene interactions often used in ligand design for the stabilization of catalytically active species. Remarkably short Au&#8722;H bonds are observed.







Abstract
Secondary ligand&#8211;metal interactions are decisive in many catalytic transformations. While arene&#8211;gold interactions have repeatedly been reported as critical structural feature in many high&#8208;performance gold catalysts, we herein report that these interactions can also be replaced by Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds without suffering any reduction in catalytic performance. Systematic experimental and computational studies on a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines featuring either a PPh3 (PhYPhos) or PCy3 (CyYPhos) moiety showed that the arene&#8208;gold interaction in the aryl&#8208;substituted compounds is efficiently compensated by the formation of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The strongest interaction is found with the C&#8722;H moiety next to the onium center, which due to the polarization results in remarkably strong interactions with the shortest Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds reported to date. Calorimetric studies on the formation of the gold complexes further confirmed that the PhYPhos and CyYPhos ligands form similarly stable complexes. Consequently, both ligands showed the same catalytic performance in the hydroamination, hydrophenoxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes, thus demonstrating that Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds are equally suited for the generation of highly effective gold catalysts than gold&#8208;arene interactions. The generality of this observation was confirmed by a comparative study between a biaryl phosphine ligand and its cyclohexyl&#8208;substituted derivative, which again showed identical catalytic performance. These observations clearly support Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds as fundamental secondary interactions in gold catalysts, thus further increasing the number of design elements that can be used for future catalyst construction.

         <title>Development and Mechanistic Studies of the Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkenylation of Enamides with Vinyl Acetates: A Versatile Approach for Ketone Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20926-20934, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with vinyl acetate has been developed as a versatile approach to diverse ketone functionalization (see scheme). The method exhibits broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity. It also features a reaction pathway involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion and syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Ketone functionalization is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Herein, we describe the development of an intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with the feedstock chemical vinyl acetate to access diverse functionalized ketones. Enamides derived from various cyclic and acyclic ketones reacted efficiently, and a number of sensitive functional groups were tolerated. In this iridium&#8208;catalyzed transformation, two structurally and electronically similar alkenes&#8212;enamide and vinyl acetate&#8212;underwent selective cross&#8208;coupling through C&#8722;H activation. No reaction partner was used in large excess. The reaction is also pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;neutral with HOAc as the only stoichiometric by&#8208;product. Detailed experimental and computational studies revealed a reaction mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion followed by syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination, which is different from that of previous vinyl acetate mediated C&#8722;H activation reactions. Finally, the alkenylation product can serve as a versatile intermediate to deliver a variety of structurally modified ketones.

         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in a Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20970-20976, September 13, 2021. </description>

A quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7 was successfully obtained by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, which enables unprecedented passive X&#8208;ray detection with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it is challenging to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without an external power supply. However, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, we obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7. Converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite stimulates a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as an enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features show the potential of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at zero bias, which is even superior to the value of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias.

         <dc:description>
Systematically synthesized new noncentrosymmetric nonpolar chiral coordination polymers exhibit unusually strong second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiencies attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and increased hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the robust hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers. Details can be found in the Communication by Joonhyuk Kee and Kang&#8197;Min Ok on page&#8197;20656.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Origin of the &#945;&#8208;Effect in SN2 Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 38/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 21069-21069, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;effect is a &#8220;reactivity booster&#8221; that affords the less basic peroxide (HOO&#8722;) the edge over hydroxide (HO&#8722;) in the Grand Prix of SN2 Reactivity. In their Research Article on page&#8197;20840, Trevor&#8197;A. Hamlin and co&#8208;workers equip researchers with two criteria that &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles need to fulfill to exhibit an &#945;&#8208;effect: (i)&#8197;a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, to reduce the destabilizing Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii)&#8197;a high&#8208;energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable orbital overlap with the substrate.

         <title>Using Light to Modify the Selectivity of Transition Metal Catalysed Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20594-20605, September 13, 2021. </description>

Light can be used to switch on or accelerate the catalytic activity of transition metals. However, using light to modify the selectivity of a transformation is considerably less common. This Minireview highlights early examples of controlling catalyst activity in this way and looks at the distinct approaches that have been taken to date.







Abstract
Light has a remarkable and often unique ability to promote chemical reactions. In combination with transition metal catalysis, it offers exciting opportunities to modify catalyst function in a non&#8208;invasive manner, most frequently being reported to switch on or accelerate reactions that do not occur in the dark. However, the ability to completely change reactivity or selectivity between two different reaction outcomes is considerably less common. In this Minireview we bring together examples of this concept and highlight their mechanistically distinct approaches. Our overview demonstrates how these non&#8208;natural, photo&#8208;switchable systems provide key fundamental mechanistic insights, enhancing our understanding and stimulating development of new catalytic activity, and how this might lead to tangible applications, impacting fields such as polymer chemistry.

Continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industry requires a detailed understanding of ongoing reaction processes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in conjunction with process analytical technology tools that help control and optimize the operation of continuous manufacturing reactors and the related chemical transformations enable chemists to optimize synthetic processes.







Abstract
Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system designed to help chemists better understand and control manufacturing processes. PAT systems operate through the combination of analytical devices, reactor control elements, and mathematical models to ensure the quality of the final product through a quality by design (QbD) approach. The expansion of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industry requires the development of PAT tools suitable for continuous operation in the environment of flow reactors. This requires innovative approaches to sampling and analysis from flowing media to maintain the integrity of the reactor content and the analyte of interest. The following Review discusses examples of PAT tools implemented in flow chemistry for the preparation of small organic molecules, and applications of self&#8208;optimization tools.

The selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to realize a sustainable, carbon&#8208;neutral economy. This Review gives a comprehensive overview focusing on catalyst and electrolyte design, and their integration with electrolyzer technology towards industrial implementation. The current challenges in the commercial use of CO2 electrolysis to generate CO are also presented to enable future developments.







Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an attractive approach to convert renewable electricity into fuels and feedstocks in the form of chemical bonds. Among the different CO2RR pathways, the conversion of CO2 into CO is considered one of the most promising candidate reactions because of its high technological and economic feasibility. Integrating catalyst and electrolyte design with an understanding of the catalytic mechanism will yield scientific insights and promote this technology towards industrial implementation. Herein, we give an overview of recent advances and challenges for the selective conversion of CO2 into CO. Multidimensional catalyst and electrolyte engineering for the CO2RR are also summarized. Furthermore, recent studies on the large&#8208;scale production of CO are highlighted to facilitate industrialization of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. To conclude, the remaining technological challenges and future directions for the industrial application of the CO2RR to generate CO are highlighted.

         <title>Unsymmetrical sp2&#8208;sp3 Disilenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20706-20710, September 13, 2021. </description>

Unprecedented formation of a series of unsymmetrical disilenes was achieved by reacting amidinato hypersilylsilylene and chlorophosphines with &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms. The coordination number of the two doubly bound silicon atoms are different. Chlorophosphines without &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms led to phosphinosilylene and silanes.







Abstract
Disilenes with differently coordinated silicon atoms are not known. Here, we have shown the high yield synthesis of a range of disilenes (2&#8211;4 and 6) upon reaction of a hypersilyl silylene PhC(NtBu)2SiSi(SiMe3)3 (1) with aliphatic chlorophosphines. The most striking characteristic of these disilenes is the presence of two differently coordinated Si atoms (one is three&#8208;coordinated, the other four&#8208;coordinated). The analogous reaction with Ph2PCl did not afford the desired disilene, but, surprisingly, led to the first tetraphosphinosilane (8). DFT calculations were performed to understand the bonding in disilenes and differences in reactivity of the complexes.

         <title>Surprising Condensation Reactions of the Azadithiolate Cofactor</title>

Azadithiolate (adt), key cofactor of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase machinery, rearranges readily via a novel condensation pathway. For FeFe azadithiolates, the condensation gives azatrithiolates, but the RuRu azadithiolates go farther, giving methyleneazadithiolates.







Abstract
Azadithiolate, a cofactor found in all [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases, is shown to undergo acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement. Fe2[(SCH2)2NH](CO)6 self&#8208;condenses to give Fe6[(SCH2)3N]2(CO)17. The reaction, which is driven by loss of NH4+, illustrates the exchange of the amine group. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that three Fe2(SR)2(CO)x butterfly subunits interconnected by the aminotrithiolate [N(CH2S)3]3&#8722;. Mechanistic studies reveal that Fe2[(SCH2)2NR](CO)6 participate in a range of amine exchange reactions, enabling new methodologies for modifying the adt cofactor. Ru2[(SCH2)2NH](CO)6 also rearranges, but proceeds further to give derivatives with Ru&#8208;alkyl bonds Ru6[(SCH2)3N][(SCH2)2NCH2]S(CO)17 and [Ru2[(SCH2)2NCH2](CO)5]2S.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Pot Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Alkynes to Access Chiral gem&#8208;(Borylsilyl)alkanes</title>

Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A range of terminal alkynes react to afford the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation and hydroboration of terminal alkynes has been developed employing a cobalt catalyst generated from Co(acac)2 and (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Ferrocelane. A variety of terminal alkynes undergo this asymmetric transformation, affording the corresponding gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkane products with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). This one&#8208;pot reaction combines (E)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkynes and consecutive enantioselective hydroboration of (E)&#8208;vinylsilanes with one chiral cobalt catalyst. This protocol represents the most straightforward approach to access versatile chiral gem&#8208;(borylsilyl)alkanes from readily available alkynes with commercially available cobalt salt and chiral ligand.

An efficient indolization/enantioconvergent borrowing hydrogen cascade is achieved for the construction of chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An efficient tandem catalysis method is achieved for the direct conversion of alcohol&#8208;containing alkynyl anilines to valuable chiral 2,3&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles. This method relies on a tandem indolization followed by enantioconvergent substitution of alcohols via borrowing hydrogen to construct two rings in one step, enabled by relay and cooperative catalysis of a chiral iridium complex with a chiral phosphoric acid. Highly diastereoselective transformations of the tricyclic indole products also provide efficient access to a diverse array of complex polycyclic indoline compounds.

Linalool synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri was found to have diterpene synthase activity and produced diterpenes with new skeletons containing a rare ethyl group. Its formation was mechanistically studied through isotopic labeling and DFT calculations. Exchange of active site residues resulted in a functional switch leading to additional novel diterpenes. This work lays the ground for future rational engineering of terpene synthases.







Abstract
A reinvestigation of the linalool synthase from Chryseobacterium polytrichastri uncovered its diterpene synthase activity, yielding polytrichastrene&#8197;A and polytrichastrol&#8197;A with new skeletons, besides known wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene and thunbergol. The enzyme mechanism was investigated by isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations to explain an unusual ethyl group formation. Rationally designed exchanges of active site residues showed major functional switches, resulting for I66F in the production of five more new compounds, including polytrichastrene&#8197;B and polytrichastrol&#8197;B, while A87T, A192V and the double exchange A87T, A192V gave a product shift towards wanju&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers</title>

A couple of fluorescent enantiomers with high PLQY of 98&#8201;% and mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activities have been developed to fabricate TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs. The resulting devices not only display intense CPEL with |gEL| of about 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3, but also show high EQEmax of 21.5&#8201;% with remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQE is 15.3&#8201;% even at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
A couple of fluorescent enantiomers, which are suitable for the emitters of high&#8208;efficiency TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs, have been developed. The enantiomers show configurational stability, high PLQY of 98&#8201;%, large kr of 7.8&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, and intense CPL activities with |glum| values of about 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3. Notably, by using matchable TADF sensitizer, the enantiomers were then exploited as emitter to fabricate CP&#8208;OLEDs. The TADF&#8208;sensitized CP&#8208;OLEDs not only show mirror&#8208;image CPEL activities with gEL values of +1.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;1.4&#215;10&#8722;3, but also display fast start&#8208;up featuring with low VT of 3.0&#8197;V as well as driving voltage of 4.8&#8197;V at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Meaningfully, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescent devices show high EQEmax of 21.5&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, whose EQEs are 21.2&#8201;% and 15.3&#8201;% at 1000 and 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The obtained EQEs are comparable to those of CP&#8208;TADF emitters, which provides a promising perspective to break through the EL efficiency limit of CP&#8208;FL emitters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of fluorescent enantiomers, which are suitable for the emitters of high-efficiency TADF-sensitized CP-OLEDs, have been developed. The enantiomers show configurational stability, high PLQY of 98&#8201;%, large k&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of 7.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and intense CPL activities with |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| values of about 2.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, by using matchable TADF sensitizer, the enantiomers were then exploited as emitter to fabricate CP-OLEDs. The TADF-sensitized CP-OLEDs not only show mirror-image CPEL activities with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; values of +1.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;1.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but also display fast start-up featuring with low &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.0&#8197;V as well as driving voltage of 4.8&#8197;V at 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Meaningfully, the TADF-sensitized fluorescent devices show high EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 21.5&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll-off, whose EQEs are 21.2&#8201;% and 15.3&#8201;% at 1000 and 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The obtained EQEs are comparable to those of CP-TADF emitters, which provides a promising perspective to break through the EL efficiency limit of CP-FL emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases and Li&#8208;Ion Flux/Solvation for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Qua&#8208;Functional Heptafluorobutyric Anhydride</title>

Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) is proposed as qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize anode(cathode)/electrolyte interphases and Li&#8208;ion flux/solvation. The reduction/oxidation decomposition and high fluorine content of HFA facilitate the formation of a uniform inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for depositing Li evenly, to form a compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to reduce the dissolution of transition metal ions.







Abstract
The safety and electrochemical performance of rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are primarily influenced by the additives in the organic liquid electrolytes. However, multi&#8208;functional additives are still rarely reported. Herein, we proposed heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) as a qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reduction/oxidation decomposition of the fluorine&#8208;rich HFA facilitate uniform inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, which enables stable lithium plating during charge and suppresses the dissolution of transition&#8208;metal ions. Moreover, HFA optimizes the Li&#8208;ion solvation for stable Li plating/stripping and serves as the surfactant to enhance the wettability of the separator by the electrolyte to increase Li&#8208;ion flux. The symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell with 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Li&#8741;NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250&#8197;cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15&#8197;C.

         <title>Exploiting Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions for Efficient and Selective Catalysis with Chiral Molecular Cages</title>

A strategy by building cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in a confined cage cavity to drive efficient and selective catalysis was established. Only 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of easily made chiral cages enabled excellent conversions and up to 97&#8201;% ee in catalyzing a class of decarboxylate Mannich reactions, which was unrealized with conventional organocatalysts.







Abstract
Exploiting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in catalyst design is a fascinating direction to develop new and fundamental catalysis. For the appealing yet flexible &#960;&#8208;face activation, can two or more &#960;&#8208;acidic surfaces be manipulated for cooperative activation to achieve efficient transformation and particularly selectivity control is highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate a supramolecular &#960;&#8208;catalysis strategy by establishing cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation in a confined electron&#8208;deficient cage cavity. The catalysts have a triazine based prism&#8208;like cage core and pendant chiral base sites. Only 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of cage catalyst efficiently catalyzed the decarboxylate Mannich reactions of sulfamate&#8208;headed cyclic aldimines and a series of malonic acid half thioesters in nearly quantitative yields and up to 97&#8201;% ee, enabling an unprecedent organocatalytic approach. The supramolecular &#960;&#8208;cavity is essential in harnessing cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for the efficient activation and excellent selectivity control.

         <title>Carbonyl Hypoiodites as Extremely Strong Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20739-20743, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl hypoiodites possess very strongly polarized iodine atoms, including what is now the largest known &#963;&#8208;hole for a neutral compound, and act as strong halogen bond donors. When strong Lewis bases, for example DMAP, are used as halogen bond acceptors, the iodine atom, for all intents and purposes, transfers from the oxygen to nitrogen atom to give an ion&#8208;pair of the general form [RCOO&#8722;][I&#8722;+N(DMAP)] with an O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N halogen bond.







Abstract
Neutral halogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes were prepared from in situ formed carbonyl hypoiodites and aromatic organic bases. The carbonyl hypoiodites have a strongly polarized iodine atom with larger &#963;&#8208;holes than any known uncharged halogen bond donor. Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen&#8208;bonded complexes where the classical O&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen&#8208;bonded COO&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N+ ion&#8208;pair (salt) with an asymmetric O&#8722;I&#8722;N moiety. X&#8208;ray analyses, NMR studies, and calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite&#8208;based O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes, confirming that in the solid&#8208;state the iodine atom is much closer to the N&#8208;atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O&#8208;atom.

The reduction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized organoberyllium chloride yields the first neutral beryllium radical, which was characterized by EPR, IR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations show significant spin density at beryllium and confirm donor&#8211;acceptor bonding between an alkylberyllium radical fragment and a neutral CAAC ligand.

The gold nanocluster [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) features a face&#8208;centered cubic Au55 kernel. This cluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, and the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V. The exclusion of chloride is an effective strategy to generate new members of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.







Abstract
A Au55 nanocluster with the composition of [Au55(p&#8208;MBT)24(Ph3P)6](SbF6)3 (p&#8208;MBT=4&#8208;methylbenzenethiolate) is synthesized via direct reduction of gold&#8208;phosphine and gold&#8208;thiolate precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that this Au55 nanocluster features a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Au55 kernel, different from the well&#8208;known two&#8208;shell cuboctahedral arrangement in Au55(Ph3P)12Cl6. The Au55 cluster shows a wide optical absorption band with optical energy gap (Eg=1.28&#8197;eV). It is found that the exclusion of chloride is crucial for the formation of the title cluster, otherwise rod&#8208;like [Au25(SR)5(PPh3)10Cl2]2+ is obtained. The strategy to run synthetic reaction in the absence of halide leads to new members of phosphine/thiolate co&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters. The Au55 nanocluster exhibits high catalytic activity and selectivity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO; the Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaches 94.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

         <title>Sustainable Production of Benzylamines from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20666-20671, September 13, 2021. </description>

An efficient strategy for the conversion of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound into benzylamines through one&#8208;pot C&#8722;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond formation with secondary amines serving as both amine sources and reducing agents was developed. The feasibility for the production of bio&#8208;based benzylamines from lignin in a two&#8208;step process was introduced in these processes.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C&#945;&#8722;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C&#946;&#8722;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.

         <title>TEMPO Containing Radical Polymonothiocarbonate Polymers with Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Regularities: Synthesis, Characterization, and Electrical Conductivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20734-20738, September 13, 2021. </description>

The preparation of atactic and isotactic radical polymonothiocarbonates by the copolymerization of a TEMPO derived epoxide and carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the presence of the metal catalyst (salen)CrCl/PPNCl is reported. It was uncovered that there is a significant enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the isotactic copolymer (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as compared to that of the atactic copolymer (10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxidanyl) (TEMPO) appended polymonothiocarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of (4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (GTEMPO) in the presence of carbonyl sulfide under ambient conditions. We have prepared the atactic and isotactic versions of this polymer, using enantiopure R or S forms of the GTEMPO monomer in the latter instances. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed both oxidation and reduction events that were characteristic of TEMPO radicals. Electrical conductivity of these polymers was measured as solid&#8208;state films after annealing the samples above their glass transition temperatures. At room temperature the isotactic polymer shows much greater conductivity (ca. 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than the atactic (ca. 10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), attributed to the well&#8208;defined stereochemistry and regulated charge transport pathway of isotactic polymer chains in contrast to the irregular structure of the atactic counterpart.

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20754-20759, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expand the diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and to explore their potential applications, new arylamine linkages for the construction of COFs have been developed. The abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons resembling that of polyaniline (PANI) enable efficient pseudocapacitive energy storage. Remarkably, the AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 271&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of new linkages is one of the most efficient strategies to enrich the diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Particularly, functional linkages can endow COFs with additional tailored properties besides the building units, which further diversify COFs with desirable functions. Herein, we have developed a new arylamine linkage for the construction of COFs. Two new arylamine&#8208;linked COFs (AAm&#8208;TPB and AAm&#8208;Py) were prepared by condensing cost&#8208;effective dimethyl succinyl succinate (DMSS) with corresponding multitopic amines (TPB&#8208;NH2 and Py&#8208;NH2). Due to the abundant electroactive diphenylamine moieties in the COF skeletons resembling that of polyaniline (PANI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive polymer, the pseudocapacitive energy storage performance of AAm&#8208;TPB was further investigated. Remarkably, the AAm&#8208;TPB electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 271&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a three&#8208;electrode setup at a discharge rate of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which represents one of the highest capacitances among the reported COF&#8208;based electrode materials.

The reaction of propargyl difluorides, R1CF2C&#8801;CR2, with alkylzincs, R3ZnCl, giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes, R1FC=C=CR2R3, with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at the &#946;&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8208;Rh intermediate, which is generated by regioselective addition of R3&#8208;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Transformations of Nitrogen&#8208;Oxyanions to Ammonia via Oxoammonium Salt</title>

Proton&#8208;assisted transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) in the presence of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8208;H) lead to a diaryl oxoammonium species [(TMB)2NO]+. In addition to the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative chemistry of [(TMB)2NO]+ towards oxidizable substrates, this report illustrates water&#8208;promoted decomposition of [(TMB)2NO]+ affording ammonia.







Abstract
Transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) to ammonia impart pivotal roles in sustainable biogeochemical processes. While metal&#8208;mediated reductions of NOx&#8722; are relatively well known, this report illustrates proton&#8208;assisted transformations of NOx&#8722; anions in the presence of electron&#8208;rich aromatics such as 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8722;H, 1&#8201;a) leading to the formation of diaryl oxoammonium salt [(TMB)2N+=O][NO3&#8722;] (2&#8201;a) via the intermediacy of nitrosonium cation (NO+). Detailed characterizations including UV/Vis, multinuclear NMR, FT&#8208;IR, HRMS, X&#8208;ray analyses on a set of closely related metastable diaryl oxoammonium [Ar2N+=O] species disclose unambiguous structural and spectroscopic signatures. Oxoammonium salt 2&#8201;a exhibits 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative reactivity in the presence of oxidizable substrates such as benzylamine, thiol, and ferrocene. Intriguingly, reaction of 2&#8201;a with water affords ammonia. Perhaps of broader significance, this work reveals a new metal&#8208;free route germane to the conversion of NOx&#8197;to&#8197;NH3.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Synergistically Enhanced Hyperpolarizability: Chiral Coordination Polymers with Nonpolar Structures Exhibiting Unusually Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20656-20660, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically synthesized new noncentrosymmetric nonpolar chiral coordination polymers exhibit unusually strong second&#8208;harmonic generation efficiencies attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and increased hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8211;acceptor system originating from the robust hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.







Abstract
Four chiral coordination polymers (CPs), M[(S,S)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] and M[(R,R)&#8208;C14H14N2O6] (M=Zn or Cd), have been exclusively synthesized in high yields with the aid of newly designed chiral ligand under hydrothermal condition. The CPs crystallizing in the orthorhombic nonpolar space group, C2221, reveal three&#8208;dimensional framework structures composed of MO4 tetrahedra and the corresponding homochiral linkers. Powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that the nonpolar CPs reveal very strong SHG efficiency of ca. 5&#8211;9 times that of KH2PO4 and exhibit type&#8208;I phase&#8208;matching behavior. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the unusually large SHG efficiency found from the nonpolar CPs should be attributable to the synergistic effect of polarizable metal cations and enhanced hyperpolarizability in the donor&#8208;acceptor system originating from the hydrogen bonding in the coordinated linkers.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp)&#8722;H Borylation of Alkynes</title>

The aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes is reported. By using a tethered&#8208;intramolecular&#8208;amine Lewis base as a ligand at the aluminium hydride centre the reactivity is controlled. Hydroalumination is switched off and selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond are enabled.







Abstract
Historically used in stoichiometric hydroalumination chemistry, recent advances have transformed aluminium hydrides into versatile catalysts for the hydroboration of unsaturated multiple bonds. This catalytic ability is founded on the defining reactivity of aluminium hydrides with alkynes and alkenes: 1,2&#8208;hydroalumination of the unsaturated &#960;&#8208;system. This manuscript reports the aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes. A tethered intramolecular amine ligand controls reactivity at the aluminium hydride centre, switching off hydroalumination and instead enabling selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond. Chemoselective C&#8722;H borylation was observed across a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes (21 examples). On the basis of kinetic and density functional theory studies, a mechanism in which C&#8722;H borylation proceeds by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between pinacolborane (HBpin) and alkynyl aluminium intermediates is proposed.

         <title>Chemoselective, Scalable Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic O&#8208;Arylation of Alcohols</title>

Highly chemoselective O&#8208;arylation was achieved by electrochemically&#8208;driven nickel catalysis. This method exhibits broad substrate scope comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd, Cu and photochemically facilitated Ni catalysis. This e&#8208;etherification forged ether bonds in demanding settings where other methods failed. With its excellent scalability, this work represents a modular, mild, and simple ether bond formation for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The formation of aryl&#8208;alkyl ether bonds through cross coupling of alcohols with aryl halides represents a useful strategic departure from classical SN2 methods. Numerous tactics relying on Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g., Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e&#8208;etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.

         <title>Antiaromatic 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20765-20770, September 13, 2021. </description>

1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes (see structure) were synthesized and found to exhibit distinct antiaromaticity as manifested by pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
s&#8208;Indacene is a classical non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Herein, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine through a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diaryl acetylenes followed by hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, as manifested in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane Using Stable Solid Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20760-20764, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and robust light&#8208;driven nonoxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) to ethane and hydrogen at room temperature was developed. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free GaN:ZnO solid solution drove NOCM with a high conversion rate, high selectivity, long&#8208;term stability, and superior coke resistance, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously in thermal catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving efficient and direct conversion of methane under mild conditions is of great significance for innovations in the chemical industry. However, the efficiency and lifetime of most catalysts remain too far from practical requirements, since it is difficult to break the first C&#8722;H bond of methane as well as to suppress the following complete dehydrogenation (or overoxidation) and the resulting carbonaceous deposition (or CO2). Here, we report that wurtzite GaN:ZnO solid solutions exhibit unique and unprecedented photocatalytic performances for the nonoxidative coupling of methane at room temperature, exclusively generating ethane with nearly stoichiometric H2. High conversion rate (&gt;330&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;70&#8197;h), and superior coke&#8208;resistance were achieved. At 293&#8197;K, the methane conversion exceeds 7&#8201;%, comparable to the equilibrium conversion of thermal catalysis at 910&#8197;K. Mechanistic studies revealed that the N&#8208;ZnGa&#8208;ON units and the absence of acid sites on the surface played crucial roles in reactivity and coke resistance, respectively.

         <title>Schottky Barrier&#8208;Induced Surface Electric Field Boosts Universal Reduction of NOx&#8722; in Water to Ammonia</title>

The tunable surface electric field induced by Schottky barrier boosts the reduction of NOx&#8722; in water for ammonia production. The tunable amounts of Ni nanoparticles inside a nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support could gradually enhance the surface electric field for enriching and fixation of NOx&#8722; anions, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% for ammonia production from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction.







Abstract
NOx&#8722; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8722; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NOx&#8722; anions on the electrode surface, including NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH3. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NOx&#8722; anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction. Remarkably, the NH3 yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic NO2&#8722; reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NOx&#8722; pollutants, including seawater or wastewater, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.

         <title>Engineering Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase to Enable Highly Selective Decarboxylation of trans Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20695-20699, September 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;efficient removal of trans fatty acids from edible oils through decarboxylation catalyzed by engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase (CvFAP) is reported. The best mutant with a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold higher trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis selectivity for the model substrates than WT, was obtained through a rational engineering approach based on the FRISM strategy.







Abstract
Due to the high risk of heart disease caused by the intake of trans fatty acids, a method to eliminate trans fatty acids from foods has become a critical issue. Herein, we engineered fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) to selectively catalyze the decarboxylation of trans fatty acids to yield readily&#8208;removed hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, while cis fatty acids remained unchanged. An efficient protein engineering based on FRISM strategy was implemented to intensify the electronic interaction between the residues and the double bond of the substrate that stabilized the binding of elaidic acid in the channel. For the model compounds, oleic acid and elaidic acid, the best mutant, V453E, showed a one&#8208;thousand&#8208;fold improvement in the trans&#8208;over&#8208;cis (ToC) selectivity compared with wild type (WT). As the first report of the direct biocatalytic decarboxylation resolution of trans/cis fatty acids, this work offers a safe, facile, and eco&#8208;friendly process to eliminate trans fatty acids from edible oils.

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 38, Page 20678-20683, September 13, 2021. </description>

N&#8208;atom deletion from N&#8208;heterocycles via N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation, Curtius&#8208;type rearrangement and rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diazene intermediates is described. It provides a unique opportunity to achieve ring contraction of (n+1)&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles to n&#8208;membered cycles.







Abstract
Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8722;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.

&#963;&#8208;Hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements are reported. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques including computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile.







Abstract
This communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques and rationalized as &#963;&#8208;hole interactions using DFT calculations and several other computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile. The word osme is the transcription of &#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;, the ancient Greek word for smell that was used to name the heaviest group&#8197;8 element in relation to the smoky odor of its tetroxide.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dioxygenation of (Aza&#8208;)Alkenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular difunctionalization of (aza&#8208;)alkenols with excellent regioselectivity is reported. A new generation of C&#8208;6&#8208;modified Pyox ligands together with the use of unusual hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidants enabled the generation of acyloxy&#8208;functionalized heterocycles in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An oxidative Pd&#8208;catalyzed intra&#8208;intermolecular dioxygenation of (aza&#8208;)alkenols has been reported, with total regioselectivity. To study the stereoselectivity, different chiral ligands as well as different hypervalent&#8208;iodine compounds have been compared. In particular, by using a C&#8208;6 modified pyridinyl&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) ligand and hypervalent iodine bearing an aromatic ring, an excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity has been achieved.

&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed intramolecular difunctionalization of (aza-)alkenols with excellent regioselectivity is reported. A new generation of C-6-modified Pyox ligands together with the use of unusual hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidants enabled the generation of acyloxy-functionalized heterocycles in excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oxidative Pd-catalyzed intra-intermolecular dioxygenation of (aza-)alkenols has been reported, with total regioselectivity. To study the stereoselectivity, different chiral ligands as well as different hypervalent-iodine compounds have been compared. In particular, by using a C-6 modified pyridinyl-oxazoline (Pyox) ligand and hypervalent iodine bearing an aromatic ring, an excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivity has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activity Trends and Mechanisms in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Production of Singlet Oxygen over Atomic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with similar structural and physicochemical properties were synthesized to uncover the activity trends and mechanisms in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production. Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and the PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2 is the most reasonable 1O2 reaction pathway.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts (M&#8208;SACs: M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) with similar structural and physicochemical properties to uncover their catalytic activity trends and mechanisms. The peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalytic activity trends are Fe&#8208;SAC&gt;Co&#8208;SAC&gt;Mn&#8208;SAC&gt;Ni&#8208;SAC&gt;Cu&#8208;SAC, and Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1) compared to the other metal&#8208;N&#8208;C species. First&#8208;principles calculations indicate that the most reasonable reaction pathway for 1O2 production is PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2; M&#8208;SACs that exhibit moderate and near&#8208;average Gibbs free energies in each reaction step have a better catalytic activity, which is the key for the outstanding performance of Fe&#8208;SACs. This study gives the atomic&#8208;scale understanding of fundamental catalytic trends and mechanisms of PMS&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production via M&#8208;SACs, thus providing guidance for developing M&#8208;SACs for catalytic organic pollutant degradation.

         <title>Steric Hindrance Drives the Boron&#8208;Initiated Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides to Photoluminescent C5&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new alkyl&#8208;substituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides was synthesized and used as monomers in the borane&#8208;initiated polymerization, achieving almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (95.8&#8201;%), with photoluminescent properties.







Abstract
A series of alkyl&#8208;subsituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides were synthesized and used as monomers in borane&#8208;initiated polymerization to obtain practically pure C5&#8208;polymers (main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms at a time). The impact of triethylborane (Et3B), tributylborane (Bu3B), tri&#8208;sec&#8208;butylborane (s&#8208;Bu3B), and triphenylborane (Ph3B) initiators on C5 polymerization was studied. Based on NMR and SEC results, we have shown that all synthesized polymers have C5 units with a unique unsaturated backbone where two conjugated double bonds are separated by one methylene. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers possess predictable molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn,NMR=2.8 &#8722;11.9&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;=1.04&#8211;1.24). It has been found that increasing the steric hindrance of both the monomer and the initiator can facilitate the formation of more C5 repeating units, thus driving the polymerization to almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (up to 95.8&#8201;%). The polymerization mechanism was studied by 11B&#8197;NMR and confirmed by DFT calculations. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers are amorphous with tunable glass&#8208;transition temperatures by adjusting the substituents of monomers, ranging from +30.1&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;38.4&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, they possess blue photoluminescence that changes to yellow illuminating the polymers for 5&#8197;days with UV radiation of 365&#8197;nm (IIE, isomerization induced emission).

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Coronoid with Hybrid Chichibabin&#8211;Schlenk Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expanded, 18&#8208;ring coronoid molecule, inspired by the structures of Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons, features a cross&#8208;over of Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; conjugation, resulting in a distinct hexaradicaloid character, easy accessibility of high&#8208;spin states, and redox amphoterism.







Abstract
A hexaradicaloid molecule with alternating Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; connectivities between adjacent spin centers was obtained by fusing two conjugation motifs in Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons into a coronoid structure. 1H&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments and computational analyses show that the system has a singlet ground state with a significant hexaradicaloid character (&#947;0=0.826, &#947;1=&#947;2=0.773). It has multiple thermally accessible high&#8208;spin states (up to the septet), with uniform energy gaps of ca 1.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between consecutive multiplicities. In line with its open&#8208;shell character, the coronoid has a small electronic band gap (ca. 0.8&#8197;eV) and undergoes two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations at low potentials, yielding cationic forms with extended near&#8208;infrared absorption. The hexaradicaloid, which combines open&#8208;shell and macrocyclic contributions to its &#960; conjugation, is an example of a design strategy for multistate spin switches and redox&#8208;amphoteric NIR dyes.

         <title>18.77&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hole transporting layer based on cobalt(II) acetate was developed by aqueous solution processing technology, low temperature thermal annealing and UV&#8208;ozone treatment, which enabled a record high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 18.77&#8201;% of binary blend organic solar cells.







Abstract
A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150&#8201;&#176;C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77&#8201;% of the binary blend OSCs was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02&#8201;%).

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to the elusive mid&#8208;infrared by direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a vanadate crystal is reported. Cs4V8O22 exhibits a wide transparent range, a strong SHG response, a large laser damage threshold and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate the key role played by its quasi&#8208;rigid layered structure in the improvement in linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical performance.







Abstract
Study of mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT) as well as the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, we report facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. It has very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KDP @ 1064&#8197;nm and 2.2 &#215; AGS @ 2100&#8197;nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within [V4O11]&#8734; layer; the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure.

         <title>Chalcogenides by Reduction of their Dioxides in Ultra&#8208;Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpected reduction of selenium(IV) and tellurium(IV) oxides to chalcogenides was achieved under ultra&#8208;alkaline conditions by using As2O3 as reducing agent. By optimization of the reaction conditions, large crystals of K2Se3, K2Te3 and K2Se2Te were grown within two days. In the latter compound, the novel mixed chalcogenide anion (SeTe)2&#8722; was discovered.







Abstract
The reaction of chalcogen dioxides ChO2 (Ch=Se, Te) with As2O3 in a 30&#8197;molar KOH hydroflux at about 200&#8201;&#176;C yielded crystals of potassium trichalcogenides K2Ch3 with dimensions up to 2&#8197;cm. Arsenic trioxide acts as electron donor and is oxidized to arsenate(V). The new heterochalcogenide anion (TeSe2)2&#8722; formed when starting from SeO2 and TeO2 simultaneously. The compound K2TeSe2 crystallizes isostructural to K2S3 and K2Se3. The unexpected redox reaction as well as the precipitation of hygroscopic compounds from an aqueous solution are attributed to a strongly reduced activity of water. The reactions were studied by Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Depending on the concentration of As2O3, colorless monochalcogenide Ch2&#8722; or orange Se22&#8722; and purple Te22&#8722; anions are dominating the solutions.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthetic Hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters with Carbon Dioxide**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthetic hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated olefins with excellent regioselectivity is reported. The method requires no sacrificial electrode and is thus amenable to a flow configuration. The products are purified by simple crystallization. The synthesis of a precursor to ethosuximide, which contains an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, illustrates the potential of the process. Finally, a robustness study has benchmarked the process for future users.







Abstract
The carboxylation of low&#8208;value commodity chemicals to provide higher&#8208;value carboxylic acids is of significant interest. Recently alternative routes to the traditional hydroformylation processes that used potentially toxic carbon monoxide and a transition metal catalyst have appeared. A significant challenge has been the selectivity observed for olefin carboxylation. Photochemical methods have shown a viable route towards the hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes but rely on the use of an excess reducing or amine reagent. Herein we report our investigations of an electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;&#8208;quaternary center carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography and the products are purified by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture after work&#8208;up.

         <title>Key Features of Polyimide&#8208;Derived Carbon Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical structure of fragments that are composed of CMS strands from varied polyimide precursors are similar, however, the texture or morphology structure is greatly affected by precursors, determining CMS membrane separation performance. The CMS properties can be tuned via control the strand&#8242;s structure, thereafter the plate and cellular structures, by designing precursor polymer chemical structure and pyrolysis conditions.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have impressive separation properties; however, both chemical and morphology structures need to be understood better. Here we characterize CMS with the simplest polyimide (PI) PMDA/pPDA (PMDA=pyromellitic dianhydride, pPDA=p&#8208;phenylenediamine), using FTIR, solid&#8208;state 15N&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR, XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra to study chemical structure. We also compare gas separation properties for this CMS to a CMS derived from a more conventional PI precursor. The detailed characterization shows the presence of aromatic pyridinic, pyrrolic rings as well as graphitic, pyridonic components and a few other groups in both CMS types derived from the very different precursors. The CMS morphologies, while related to precursor and pyrolysis temperature details, show similarities consistent with a physical picture comprising distributed molecular sieving plate&#8208;like structures. These results assist in understanding diverse CMS membrane separation performance.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Carbonylation to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Piperidones via Selective Cleavage of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Triple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic carbonylative cleavage of carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds is achieved. This allows for a general and direct synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation of alkynols.







Abstract
A direct and selective synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by a new palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation is described. In the presented protocol, easily available propargylic alcohols react with aliphatic amines to provide a broad variety of interesting heterocycles. Key to the success of this transformation is a remarkable catalytic cleavage of the present carbon&#8211;carbon triple bond by using a specific catalyst with 2&#8208;diphenylphosphinopyridine as ligand and appropriate reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments revealed branched unsaturated acid 11 as crucial intermediate.

         <title>The archetypal homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker &#8211; synthesis, mechanistic studies, and quantum chemical investigations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduction of [SmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)(BH4)(thf)] (COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3&#160;= 1,4&#8209;(iPr3Si)3C8H6) with KC8 resulted in [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4], the first example of a homoleptic lanthanide quadruple&#8208;decker. As indicated by an analysis of the bond metrics in the solid&#8208;state, the inner Sm ion is present in the divalent oxidation state, while the outer ones are trivalent. This observation could be confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Mechanistic studies revealed not only insight into possible formation pathways of [SmIII/II/III(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)4] but also resulted in the transformation to other mixed metal sandwich complexes with unique structural properties. These are the 1D&#8208;polymeric chain structured [KSmIII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]n and the hexametallic species [(tol)K(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)SmII(COT1,4&#8208;SiiPr3)]2 which were initially envisioned as possible building blocks as part of different retrosynthetically guided pathways that we developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocarriers for Skin Applications: Where Do We Stand?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skin penetration of active molecules for treatment of diverse diseases is a major field of research owing to the advantages associated with skin like easy accessibility, reduced systemic derived side effects and increased therapeutic efficacy. Despite these advantages, dermal drug delivery is generally challenging due to the low skin permeability of therapeutics. Although various methods have been developed to improve skin penetration and permeation of therapeutics, they are usually aggressive and could lead to irreversible damage to the stratum corneum. Nanosized carrier systems represent an alternative approach for current technologies with minimal damage to the natural barrier function of skin. In this review, the use of nanoparticles to deliver drug molecules, genetic material and vaccines into the skin is discussed. In addition, nanotoxicology studies and recent clinical development on nanoparticles are highlighted to shed light on their potential to undergo market translation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes a Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of a nitrile group on the surface of a garnet solid electrolyte is demonstrated in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108050) by Tao Zhang and co&#8208;workers. A firm and stable electrode/electrolyte interphase was constructed by using the confirmed surface coordination, enabling the long&#8208;term stable cycling of a lithium metal solid state battery.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using Online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The digitization of chemistry requires that synthesis procedures can be written and optimized in a chemical programming language to perform reliable &#8220;chemputation&#8221; for the synthesis on the &#8220;chemputer&#8221; robot, a universal synthesis machine. The cover image shows how a universal chemical synthesis engine equipped with an NMR sensor can be used to optimize reactions producing the automated synthesis procedure as an optimized process code ensuring that the chemputation can be improved and is reliable. Details are reported by Leroy Cronin, Franziska Emmerling et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106323).

         <title>Photoinduced radical emission in a coassembly system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D  2  &#8594;D  0  vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cooperative OSDA Blueprint for Highly Siliceous Faujasite Zeolite Catalysts with Enhanced Acidity Accessibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cooperative OSDA strategy is demonstrated, leading to novel high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites with a large potential for disruptive acid catalysis. In bottom&#8208;up synthesis, the symbiosis of choline ion (Ch  +  ) and 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (CE) was evidenced, in a form of full occupation of the sodalite (  sod  ) cages with the  trans  Ch  +  conformer, induced by the CE presence. CE itself occupied the supercages along with additional  gauche  Ch  +  , but in synthesis without CE, no  trans  was found. The cooperation, and thus the fraction of  trans  Ch  +  , was closely related to the Si/Al ratio, a key measure for FAU stability and acidity. As such, a bottom&#8208;up handle for lowering the Al&#8208;content of FAU and tuning its acid site distribution is shown. A mechanistic study demonstrated that forming  sod  cages with  trans  Ch  +  is key to the nucleation of high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites. The materials showed superior performances to commercial FAU zeolites and those synthesized without cooperation, in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL&#8208;CVD method is based on the formation of a non&#8208;volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL&#8208;CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL&#8208;CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and&#160;3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives via enzymatic reductive amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson&#8217;s disease therapy Rotigotine in 63% overall yield and 92%  ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfaces and Interface Layers in Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the superior thermal stability, metal halide inorganic perovskite materials have been continuously attracting interests in the application of photovoltaics. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on inorganic perovskites is over 20%. As this PCE corresponds to 70% of the theoretical limit, there remains a larger space for further improving the device PCEs compared to organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PSCs. The main loss is in the photovoltage, which is limited by interfaces in terms of non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by traps and energy&#8208;level mismatch. Furthermore, inefficient charge extraction at interfacial contacts reduces the photocurrent and fill factor. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments in the fundamental understanding of how the interfaces influence the performance of solar cells based on inorganic perovskite absorbers. An outlook for the development of highly efficient and stable inorganic PSCs from the interface point of view is also given.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Dipnictadialanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being potential precursors for semiconducting materials, cyclic heteroatomic group 13/15 compounds have received considerable attention. In most cases, the group 13 and 15 elements are four&#8208;coordinate, and base&#8208;free variants of the type [RAl(&#956;&#8208;PR&#8217;)]  2  have not been reported to date. Using the Al(I) precursor Cp  3t  Al in conjunction with triphosphiranes (PAr)  3  (Ar = Mes, Dip, Tip) we have now succeeded in preparing Lewis base&#8208;free cyclic diphosphadialanes with both the Al and P bearing three substituents. Using the sterically more demanding Dip&#8208; and Tipsubstituents the first 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutanes were obtained, whereas with Mes&#8208;substituents [Cp  3t  Al(&#956;&#8208;PMes)]  2  is formed. This divergent reactivity was corroborated by DFT studies, which indicated the thermodynamic preference for the 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4dialuminacyclobutane form for sterically more demanding groups on phosphorus. Using Cp*Al we could extend this concept to the corresponding cyclic diarsadialanes [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;AsAr)]  2  (Ar = Dip, Tip) and additionally add the phosphorus variants [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]  2  (P = Mes, Dip, Tip). The reactivity of one variant [Cp  3t  Al(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]  2  towards NHCs was tested and resulted in double NHC&#8208;stabilised</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Trifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Catalyzed by High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a series of air&#8208;stable Ni  III  complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF  3  ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of Ni  II  to Ni  III  . These Ni  III  complexes act as efficient photoredox catalysts for C(sp  2  )&#8211;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Function&#8208;Orientated Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Near&#8208;infrared Responsive Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8208;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was first time fabricated  via  a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980 nm) into visible light (540 nm and 653 nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward  Escherichia coli  . This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.</dc:description>

UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (980 nm) into visible light (540 nm and 653 nm), which further excites the perylenediimide-based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR-responsive bacterial inhibition toward  Escherichia coli  . This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF-based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy migration  control of multi&#8208;modal emissions in an Er3+ doped nanostructure toward information encryption and deep learning decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multi&#8208;modal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er  3+  &#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535 nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multi&#8208;modal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. Herein, the most recent contributions are reviewed, demonstrating exciting new opportunities. Namely, combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore bound water at the key residue histidine&#160;37 in Influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic details of structured water molecules are indispensable to understand the thermodynamics of important biological processes including the proton conduction mechanism of the M2 protein. Despite the expectation of structured water molecules based on crystal structures of Influenza A M2, only two water populations have been observed by NMR in reconstituted lipid bilayer samples. These are the bulk and lipid associated water populations typically seen in membrane samples. Here, we detect a bound water molecule at a chemical shift of 11 ppm, located near the functional histidine 37 residue in the M2 conductance domain, which comprises residues 18 to 60. Combining 100 kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and density functional theory calculations, we show that the bound water forms a hydrogen bond to the &#948;1 nitrogen of histidine&#8208;37.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of surfactants on the molecular structure of the buried oil/water interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration due to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.</dc:description>

         <title>General, metal&#8208;free synthesis of carbon nanofiber assemblies from plant oils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of carbon nanofibers suffers in classical approaches from either costs or the introduction of metallic impurities, and a more simple method of synthesis based on affordable and accessible educts would be highly welcomed. For that, we rationally designed a metal&#8208;free approach based on ketene chemistry using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and vegetable oil. Based on the characterization of intermediates, P2O5&#8208;oil reaction yielded most possibly alkylketenes, which polymerized into poly(ketene) with abundant enol groups. The enol groups further reacted with P2O5, forcing the poly(ketene) to assemble into a nano&#8208;sized preassembly structure. Moderate heating transforms these soft assembly structures into carbonaceaus nanofibers. Moreover, this approach is applicable to other chemicals with similar structure to vegetable oil, which demonstrates the generality of methodology. The carbon nanofibers with P&#8208;O&#8208;C functionalization show relatively high graphitization degree and promising textural properties (e.g., well&#8208;developed porosity, negatively&#8208;charged surface). The C&#8208;O&#8208;P environment accounts for 66 at% of the total P and create a superior thermal stability of carbon nanofibers as compared with unfunctionalized all&#8208;carbon nanotubes. As a model application, a CDI system built of a carbon nanofibers&#8208;based electrode countered by an activated carbon&#8208;based electrode exhibited exceptional performance: a NaCl adsorption capacity ~30 mg g&#8208;1 at applied voltage of 1.2 V was reached, with very stable adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. This research opens a promising path to large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost synthesis of 1&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers from sustainable carbon sources without using metal catalysts or expensive equipment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing a tridentate NNS pincer ligand is reported. The effect of the geometric constraint on the electronic structure was probed by theoretical calculations and derivatization reactions. Reactions with N&#8211;H bonds result in formation of cooperative addition products. The thermochemistry of these transformations is strongly dependent on the substrate, with ammonia activation being thermoneutral. This represents the first example of a molecular compound that  reversibly  activates ammonia  via  N&#8211;H bond scission in solution upon mild heating.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Vaccine Dynamics with Quantum Dots for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct visualization of vaccine fate is important to investigate its immunoactivation process in order to elucidate the detailed molecular reaction process at single&#8208;molecular level. Yet, visualization of the spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines remains poorly explored. Here, we show that quantum dot (QD) nanomaterials allow for monitoring vaccine dynamics and for amplified immune response. Synthetic QDs enable efficient conjugation of antigen and adjuvants to target tissues and cells, and non&#8208;invasive imaging the trafficking dynamics to lymph nodes and cellular compartments. The nanoparticle vaccine elicits potent immune responses and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long&#8208;term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying the immune response and for evaluating the vaccine efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dirhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective B&#8211;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;Diaryl Carbenes: Efficient Access to gem&#8208;Diarylmethine Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine boron compounds are important synthetic building blocks that can be transformed into chiral  gem  &#8208;diaryl methanes or triaryl methanes, which are common scaffolds in bioactive molecules. However, the scarcity of reliable methods for synthesizing chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine borons limits their applications. Herein, we report a method for highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8211;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14,300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance. Moreover, the borane compounds synthesized by this method could be efficiently transformed into diaryl methanol, diaryl methyl amine, and triaryl methane derivatives with good stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies suggested that the borane adduct coordinated to the rhodium catalyst and thus interfered with decomposition of the diazomethane, and that insertion of a rhodium carbene (generated from the diazomethane) into the B&#8211;H bond was most likely the rate&#8208;determining step. Hammett analysis indicated that the enantioselectivity depended strongly on electronic differences between the two aryl groups of the diazomethane.</dc:description>
