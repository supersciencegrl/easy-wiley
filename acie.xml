      <title>Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation via Catalytically Generated Aminocarbene Complexes: Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminative Cyclization of Enynes with Secondary Amines</title>
      <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;stabilized transition&#8208;metal carbene complexes are useful building blocks for organic synthesis, but their catalytic generation from substrates with common functional groups is still challenging. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002710), F. Kakiuchi and co&#8208;workers report a novel hydroaminative cyclization of enynes with secondary amines catalyzed by phosphine&#8208;quinolinolato rhodium complexes to form cyclic enamines via catalytic construction of an aminocarbene intermediate.

      <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Iodoesterification of Simple Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Haloesterifications using easily obtainable alkenes and carboxylic acids have unique industrial benefits. The first general catalytic asymmetric iodoesterification of simple alkenes was achieved by T. Arai et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003886) by using a dinuclear zinc&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;(R,S,S)&#8208;bis(aminoimino)binaphthoxide (di&#8208;Zn) complex. The picture represents a harmonizing quartet of metal ionic bond, hydrogen bond, halogen bond, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, acting together to enable the asymmetric iodoesterification of simple alkenes.

      <title>Target&#8208;Directed Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition for Assembling HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA Binding Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>
A potential strategy for the rapid discovery of anti&#8208;viral therapeutic agents is delineated by J. Dash et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003461). HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA promotes azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to generate a new class of triazole&#8208;linked thiazole peptidomimetics as the RNA's own binders.

Dash et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200346110.1002/anie.202003461&lt;/a&gt;). HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA promotes azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to generate a new class of triazole&#8208;linked thiazole peptidomimetics as the RNA's own binders.

      <title>Unprecedented Kinetic Inertness for a Mn2+&#8208;Bispidine Chelate: A Novel Structural Entry for Mn2+&#8208;Based Imaging Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Mn2+ complexes are more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI agents, and 52Mn is an emerging radionuclide for positron emission tomography. Both applications require highly inert chelates which, given the labile nature of Mn2+, remains a challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003685), L. Charbonni&#232;re, &#201;. T&#243;th and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a strongly preorganized 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidol ligand provides exceptional kinetic inertness to its Mn2+ complex.

      <title>Advances in Understanding Mechanisms of Perovskites and Pyrochlores as Electrocatalysts using In&#8208;Situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Ray of light: In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy methods for electrochemical tests have been developed to follow the changes of electron configurations and geometric local structures of metal oxides during electrocatalysis. This Minireview gives a brief introduction to recent progress in understanding catalytic mechanisms of perovskite and pyrochlore oxides by using this method.







Abstract
Metal oxides are some of the most promising candidates as electrocatalysts for electrical&#8208;energy&#8208;storage (EES) systems. Particularly, perovskite and pyrochlore oxides have been intensively investigated as bifunctional electrocatalysts because of their superior catalytic activities during the oxygen&#8208;reduction and &#8208;evolution reactions. However, the origin of the outstanding catalytic activities and structural changes of the materials are not clear, in part due to the difficulty in identification during electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, we present a critical overview of recent progress in understanding catalytic mechanisms of perovskite and pyrochlore oxides, highlighting the innovative in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis for electrochemical tests.

      <title>Polyesters by a Radical Pathway: Rationalization of the Cyclic Ketene Acetal Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening polymerization (rROP) of Cyclic Ketene Acetals (CKAs) combines the advantages of both ring&#8208;opening polymerization and radical polymerization thereby allowing the robust production of polyesters coupled with the mild polymerization conditions of a radical process. rROP was recently rejuvenated by the possibility to copolymerize CKAs with classic vinyl monomers leading to the insertion of cleavable functionality into a vinyl&#8208;based copolymer backbone and thus imparting (bio)degradability. Such materials are suitable for a large scope of applications, particularly within the biomedical field. The competition between the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;retaining propagation routes is a major complication in the development of efficient CKA monomers, ultimately leading to the use of only four monomers that are known to completely ring&#8208;open under all experimental conditions. In this article we investigate in detail the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of model CKA monomers and demonstrate by the combination of DFT calculations and kinetic modeling using PREDICI software that we are now able to predict in silico the ring&#8208;opening ability of CKA monomers.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radical Ring&#8208;Opening polymerization (rROP) of Cyclic Ketene Acetals (CKAs) combines the advantages of both ring&#8208;opening polymerization and radical polymerization thereby allowing the robust production of polyesters coupled with the mild polymerization conditions of a radical process. rROP was recently rejuvenated by the possibility to copolymerize CKAs with classic vinyl monomers leading to the insertion of cleavable functionality into a vinyl&#8208;based copolymer backbone and thus imparting (bio)degradability. Such materials are suitable for a large scope of applications, particularly within the biomedical field. The competition between the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;retaining propagation routes is a major complication in the development of efficient CKA monomers, ultimately leading to the use of only four monomers that are known to completely ring&#8208;open under all experimental conditions. In this article we investigate in detail the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of model CKA monomers and demonstrate by the combination of DFT calculations and kinetic modeling using PREDICI software that we are now able to predict in silico the ring&#8208;opening ability of CKA monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>A difluoromethyl group (CF  2  H) is considered to be a lipophilic and metabolically stable bioisostere of an amino (NH  2  ) group. Therefore, methods that can rapidly convert an NH  2  group into a CF  2  H group would be of great value to medicinal chemistry. We report herein an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed approach for the conversion of alkyl pyridinium salts, which can be readily synthesized from the corresponding alkyl amines, to their alkyl difluoromethane analogues.

      <title>S&#8208;modified oxygen vacancies in iron&#8208;cobalt oxide nanosheets: Enabling extremely high activity of oxygen evolution reaction for achieving industrial water splitting benchmark</title>
      <dc:description>Water electrolysis is a promising strategy for high&#8208;purity hydrogen production but restrained by the high electricity cost. Developing an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst with excellent activity and low price is indispensable for reducing water electrolysis cost. The modulation of electronic structure of catalysts can be an efficient strategy to boost their activities. Herein, the oxygen vacancies of defective iron&#8208;cobalt oxide (FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo) nanosheets are modified by the homogeneously distributed sulfur (S) atoms. S atoms can not only effectively stabilize oxygen vacancies (Vo), but also form the Co&#8208;S coordination with Co active site in the Vo, which can modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S to exhibit much superior OER activity. Remarkably, FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S exhibits a mass activity of 2440.0 A g  &#8208;1  at the voltage of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH, which is 25.4 times higher than that of RuO  2  (96.0 A g  &#8208;1  ). Meanwhile, its Tafel slope can as low as 21.0 mV dec  &#8208;1  , indicative of its excellent charge transfer rate. When FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S (anode catalyst) is paired with the defective CoP  3  /Ni  2  P (cathode catalyst) for overall water splitting, the current densities can be achieved as high as 249.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 406.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the cell voltage of 2.0 V and 2.3 V, respectively, which meet well the requirement of industrial water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Stringing the PDI Bow</title>
      <dc:description>This study explores a new mode of contortion in perylene diimides where the molecule is bent, like a bow along its long axis. We synthesize these bowed PDIs through a facile 4&#8208;fold Suzuki macrocyclization with aromatic linkers and a tetraborylated perylene diimide that introduces strain and results in a bowed structure. By&#160;&#8208;altering&#160;the strings of the bow, the degree of bending can be controlled from flat to highly&#160;bent. Through spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that the energy of the lowest unoccupied orbital can be controlled by the degree of bending in the structures and the energy of the highest occupied orbital can be controlled to a large extent by the constitution of the aromatic linkers.&#160;The important finding is that the bowing results not only in red&#8208;shifted absorptions but also more facile reductions.</dc:description>

      <title>A Mixed&#8208;Valence {Fe13} Cluster Exhibiting Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer&#8208;Switched Spin Crossover</title>
      <dc:description>It is promising and challenging to manipulate the electronic structures and functions of materials utilizing both metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) to tune the valence and spin states of metal ions. Here, metallocyanate building block is utilized to link with a ferrous&#8722;triazole moiety and generates a mixed&#8208;valence complex {[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  9  [Fe  II  4  (trz&#8208;ph)  6  ]}&#8901;[Ph  3  PMe]  2  &#8901;[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ] (  1  ; trz&#8208;ph = 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;tirazole). Moreover, MMCT occurs between Fe  III  and one of the Fe  II  sites after heat treatment, resulting in the generation of a new phase, {[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  II  (CN)  3  ][(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  8  [Fe  III  Fe  II  3  (trz&#8208;ph)  6  ]}&#8901;[Ph  3  PMe]  2  &#183;[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ] (  1a  ). Structural and magnetic studies reveal that MMCT can tune the two&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1  into one&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1a  . Our work demonstrates that the integration of MMCT and SCO can provide a new alternative for manipulating functional spin&#8208;transition materials with accessible multi&#8208;electronic states.</dc:description>

Moreover, MMCT occurs between Fe  III  and one of the Fe  II  sites after heat treatment, resulting in the generation of a new phase, {[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  II  (CN)  3  ][(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  8  [Fe  III  Fe  II  3  (trz&#8208;ph)  6  ]}&#8901;[Ph  3  PMe]  2  &#183;[(Tp  4&#8208;Me  )Fe  III  (CN)  3  ] (  1a  ). Structural and magnetic studies reveal that MMCT can tune the two&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1  into one&#8208;step SCO behavior of  1a  . Our work demonstrates that the integration of MMCT and SCO can provide a new alternative for manipulating functional spin&#8208;transition materials with accessible multi&#8208;electronic states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enantiomeric discrimination through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering using a chemically modified silver tip with an asymmetric atomic arrangement</title>
      <dc:description>Enantiomeric discrimination is achieved by tip&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) using a silver tip chemically modified by an achiral  para  &#8208;mercaptopyridine (  p  MPY) probe molecule. Differences in the relative intensities of the  p  MPY spectra were monitored for three pairs of enantiomers containing hydroxyl (&#8211;OH) and/or amino (&#8211;NH  2  ) groups. The N: or N  +  &#8211;H functionality of the  p  MPY&#8208;modified tip participates in hydrogen bond interactions with a particular molecular orientation of each chiral isomer. The asymmetric arrangement of silver atoms at the apex of the tip induces an asymmetric electric field, which causes the tip to become a chiral center. Differences in the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states of the metal&#8211;achiral probe system in conjunction with the asymmetric electric field produce different enhancements in the Raman signals of the two enantiomers. The near&#8208;field effect of the asymmetric electric field, which depends on the number of analyte functional groups capable of hydrogen bond formation, improves the degree of discrimination.</dc:description>

      <title>How to Make Nitroaromatics Glow: Next Generation Large, &#967;&#8212;Shaped, Centrosymmetric Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>This article describes a synthetic approach to a new structurally diverse family of &#960;&#8208;expanded diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs). These red&#8208;emissive dyes, based on a previously unknown skeleton, can be easily synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy involving the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrrole followed by N&#8208;arylation and subsequent intramolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation.
A careful selection of the aryl substituents on DPP gives access to a
&#960;&#8208;extended DPP derivative with intense fluorescence reaching 750 nm. The fact that NO2 groups do not engage in the excited states is responsible for the lack of fluorescence quenching when this functional group is present. Comprehensive spectroscopic assays combined with first principle calculations corroborated that both N&#8208;arylated and fused DPPs reach a locally excited (S1) state after excitation, followed by internal conversion to states with solvent and structural relaxation, before eventually undergoing intersystem crossing. Only the structurally relaxed state is fluorescent with lifetimes in the range of several nanoseconds and tens of picoseconds in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents, respectively. The aforementioned lifetimes correlate with fluorescence quantum yields, which range from 6% to 88% in non&#8208;polar solvents and from 0.4% and 3.2% in polar solvents. For the fully fused DPP a very inefficient (T1) population is responsible for fluorescence quantum yields as high as 88% in polar solvents, which is among the uppermost ever recorded for nitro&#8208;aromatics. These findings demonstrate the immense importance of the ability to design, build and fine&#8208;tune the structure of large, &#960;&#8208;expanded functional dyes so that the strong polarization of centrosymmetric structures is achieved.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Elastic organic crystals have attracted considerable attention as next&#8208;generation flexible smart materials. However, the detailed information on both molecular packing change and macroscopic mechanical crystal deformations upon applied stress are still insufficient. Here we report that fluorescent single crystals of 9,10&#8208;dibromoanthracene are elastically bendable and stretchable, which allows a detailed investigation of the deformation behavior. We clearly observed a Poisson&#8217;s effect for the crystal, where the short axes (i.e., b and c&#8208;axes) of the crystal are contracted upon elongation along the long axis (i.e., a&#8208;axis). Moreover, we found that the Poisson&#8217;s ratios along the b&#8208;axis and c&#8208;axis are largely different (i.e., anisotropic Poisson&#8217;s effect). Theoretical molecular simulation suggests that the tilting motion of the anthracene may be responsible for the large deformation along the c&#8208;axis. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement of the bent elastic crystals reveal that the PL spectra at the outer (elongated), central (neutral) and inner (contracted) sides are different from each other. Furthermore, we observe a reversible change in the PL spectra upon applying and releasing the elongation stress.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Freeze, don't move: A transformation of fluxional into configurationally stable axially chiral N&#8208;arylpyrroles was achieved through a highly atroposelective electrophilic aromatic substitution catalyzed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium Lewis acid, with follow&#8208;up transformations leading to structurally diverse axially chiral N&#8208;arylpyrroles.







Abstract
A transformation of fluxional into configurationally stable axially chiral N&#8208;arylpyrroles was achieved with a highly atroposelective electrophilic aromatic substitution catalyzed by a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium Lewis acid. Specifically, N&#8208;arylpyrroles were alkylated with N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole electrophiles in up to 93&#8201;% yield and with up to &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee, and follow&#8208;up conversions reveal the synthetic utility of this new method. DFT calculations elucidate the origins of the observed excellent atroposelectivity.

      <title>Challenges and Perspectives of DNA Nanostructures in Biomedicine</title>
      <dc:description>
Although DNA nanotechnology has spawned a broad variety of biomedical nanostructures over the last decade, these DNA nanostructures often suffer from limited stability and considerable immunogenicity. This Review introduces various biomedical applications of DNA nanostructures, describes the challenges imposed on the DNA nanostructures by the physiological environment, and discusses possible solutions to these challenges.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology holds substantial promise for future biomedical engineering and the development of novel therapies and diagnostic assays. The subnanometer&#8208;level addressability of DNA nanostructures allows for their precise and tailored modification with numerous chemical and biological entities, which makes them fit to serve as accurate diagnostic tools and multifunctional carriers for targeted drug delivery. The absolute control over shape, size, and function enables the fabrication of tailored and dynamic devices, such as DNA nanorobots that can execute programmed tasks and react to various external stimuli. Even though several studies have demonstrated the successful operation of various biomedical DNA nanostructures both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, major obstacles remain on the path to real&#8208;world applications of DNA&#8208;based nanomedicine. Here, we summarize the current status of the field and the main implementations of biomedical DNA nanostructures. In particular, we focus on open challenges and untackled issues and discuss possible solutions.

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly in Water with N&#8208;Substituted Imines</title>
      <dc:description>
Dynamic duo: This Review discusses novel types of water&#8208;compatible dynamic covalent bonds for the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;free organic molecules based on either acylhydrazone or oxime chemistry. Recent progress in the design, synthesis, and characterization in water of complex molecules with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional architectures, the self&#8208;assembly of which is based on this dynamic approach, is summarized here.







Abstract
Imine synthesis has enjoyed a long history as the dynamic covalent reaction of choice for the construction of purely covalent molecular architectures. In organic solvents, the formation of imine bonds is reversible but leads to thermodynamically stable products. In the presence of water, however, imine bonds are labile, a fact which limits their utility as mediators of self&#8208;assembly in aqueous and biological media. In this Review, we discuss water&#8208;compatible dynamic covalent bonds based on N&#8208;substituted imine derivatives, namely hydrazones and oximes, for the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8208;free organic architectures with well&#8208;defined structures. The reasons why hydrazones and oximes are more robust in water than their parent imines are explained. Recent progress in the self&#8208;assembly, characterization, and design principles of a variety of complex molecules including macrocycles, cages, catenanes, and knots in aqueous media is highlighted. Emerging applications for these molecules, including guest recognition and separations, are also discussed.

      <title>Simulation vs. Understanding: A Tension, in Quantum Chemistry and Beyond. Part B. The March of Simulation, for Better or Worse</title>
      <dc:description>
In the second segment of a tripartite essay, we move from a sketch of the artificial intelligence debate to examples of AI in action, both in chemistry and society. Impressive, scary, and funny, these abound. Yet, moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. And causes are deeper than correlations. We do try to give voice to the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future of AI in chemistry. And return to fuss.







Abstract
In the second part of this Essay, we leave philosophy, and begin by describing Roald's being trashed by simulation. This leads us to a general sketch of artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens&#8217; account of what a go&#8208;playing program knows. Back to our terrain&#8212;we ask &#8220;Quantum Chemistry, &#8224; ca. 2020?&#8221; Then we move to examples of Big Data, machine learning and neural networks in action, first in chemistry and then affecting social matters, trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. And that posited causes, even if recognized as provisional, represent a much deeper level of understanding than correlations. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving voice to the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future. But we don't do justice to that view&#8212;how could we, older mammals on the way to extinction that we are? We try. But then we return to fuss, questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. And argue for a science of many tongues.

      <title>Ineffective OH&#8208;pinning of the flipping dynamics of a spherical guest within a tight&#8208;fitting tube</title>
      <dc:description>A supramolecular/synthetic method was devised to affix a sterically hindered substituent onto a fullerene guest encapsulated in a tubular host. A two&#8208;wheeled complex of (C  59  N)&#8211;(C  59  N) with a tubular host was oxidatively bisected to afford the C  59  N  +  &#160;cation captured in the tube. The C  59  N  +  &#160;cation in the tube was then trapped by ethanol or water, which led to an oxy substituent pinned on the guest. The guest motions within the tube were modulated by the pinned substituent, and up&#8208;and&#8208;down flipping motions were halted by an ethoxy substituent. A hydroxy substituent, however, was ineffective in halting the flipping motions despite the tight&#8208;fitting relationship between the tubular host and the spherical guest. Theoretical calculations of the dynamics revealed that the flipping motions were assisted by OH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds between the guest and the carbon&#8208;rich wall and that sliding motions of the OH group were also facilitated by deformations of the tube.</dc:description>

      <title>Glycoconjugated Metallohelices have Improved Nuclear Delivery and Suppress Tumour Growth In Vivo</title>

The sixteen resulting architectures are water&#8208;stable and optically pure, and exhibit improved antiproliferative selectivity against colon cancer cells (HCT116 p53  +/+  ) with respect to the non&#8208;cancerous ARPE&#8208;19 cell line.

Addition of the glucose units affects the binding orientation of the metallohelix to naked DNA, but does not substantially alter the overall affinity. In a mouse model, the glucose conjugated compound was far better tolerated, and tumour growth delays for the parent compound (2.6 d) were improved to 4.3 d; performance as good as cisplatin but with the advantage of no weight loss in the subjects.</dc:description>

In a mouse model, the glucose conjugated compound was far better tolerated, and tumour growth delays for the parent compound (2.6 d) were improved to 4.3 d; performance as good as cisplatin but with the advantage of no weight loss in the subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>We use the Preyssler polyoxoanion, [NaP5W30O110  ]14&#8722;  ({P5W30}), as a platform for evaluating the role of non&#8208;bridging cations in the formation of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;bridged polyoxometalate coordination frameworks. Specifically, we show that the assembly architecture of Co2+&#8208;bridged&#160; frameworks is dependent on the identity and amount of alkali or alkaline earth cations present during crystallization. The inclusion of Li+  , Na+  , K+  , Mg2+  or Ca2+  in the framework synthesis is used to selectively synthesize five different Co  2+&#8208;bridged {P5W30} structures. We evaluate the role of the competition between K+  and Co2+  for binding to {P5W30} in dictating framework assembly. The role of ion&#8208;pairing on framework assembly structure and available void volume is discussed. Overall, these results provide insight into factors governing the ability to achieve controlled assembly of POM&#8208;based coordination networks.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Photoelectrochemical Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroarenes are structural motifs found in many bioactive compounds and functional materials. Dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds provides straightforward access to functionalized heteroarenes from readily available materials. Established methods employ stoichiometric chemical oxidants under conditions of heating or light irradiation. By merging electrochemistry and photochemistry, we have achieved efficient photoelectrochemical dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes and C(sp3)&#8211;H donors through H2  evolution, without the addition of metal catalysts or chemical oxidants. Mechanistically, the C(sp3)&#8211;H donor is converted to a nucleophilic C&#8208;radical through H&#8208;atom transfer with chlorine atom, which is produced by light irradiation of anodically generated Cl2  from Cl&#8722;.

      <title>Free Radical Chemistry of Phosphasilenes</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the characteristics of radicals formed from silicon&#8208;containing heavy analogues of alkenes is of great importance for their application in radical polymerization. Bulky and electronic substituent effects in such compounds as phosphasilenes not only stabilize the Si=P double bond, but also influence the structure and species of the formed radicals. Herein we report our first investigations of radicals derived from phosphasilenes with Mes (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl), Tip (2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), Dur (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and NMe  2  (dimethylamino) substituents on the P atom, using muon spin spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Adding muonium (a light isotope of hydrogen) to phosphasilenes reveals that: a) the electron&#8208;donor NMe  2  and the bulkiest Tip&#8208;substituted phosphasilenes form several muoniated radicals with different rotamer conformations; b) bulky Dur&#8208;substituted phosphasilene forms two radicals (Si&#8208; and P&#8208;centred); and c) Mes&#8208;substituted phosphasilene mainly forms one species of radical, at the P centre.

      <title>Reconciling Electrostatic and n&#8594;&#960;* Orbital Contributions in Carbonyl Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Attractive interactions between carbonyl groups have been studied extensively, primarily due to their prevalence in protein structure. However, prior investigations have pointed to conflicting origins; earlier investigations identified dominant electrostatic dipolar interactions, while others have implicated lone pair n&#8594;&#960;* orbital delocalisation.

A combined experimental and computational approach confirmed the dominance of electrostatic interactions in a new series of synthetic molecular balances, while also highlighting the distance&#8208;dependent observation of inductive polarisation manifested via n&#8594;&#960;* orbital delocalisation. Computational fiSAPT energy decomposition and natural bonding orbital analyses correlated with experimental data to reveal the contexts in which short&#8208;range inductive polarisation augment electrostatic dipolar interactions.

      <title>Nature of the Arsonium&#8208;Ylide Ph3As=CH2 and a Uranium(IV) Arsonium&#8208;Carbene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Treatment of [Ph3EMe][I] with [Na{N(SiMe3)2}] affords the ylides [Ph3E=CH2] (E = As, 1As; P, 1P). For 1As this overcomes prior difficulties in the synthesis of this classical arsonium&#8208;ylide that have historically impeded its wider study. The structure of 1As has now been determined, 45 years after it was first convincingly isolated, and compared to 1P, confirming the long&#8208;proposed hypothesis of increasing pyramidalisation of the ylide&#8208;carbon, highlighting the increasing dominance of E+&#8208;C&#8208; dipolar resonance form (sp3&#8208;C) over the E=C ene p&#8208;bonded form (sp2&#8208;C), as group 15 is descended. The uranium(IV)&#8208;cyclometallate complex [U{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2(CH2CH2SiPri2CH(Me)CH2)}] reacts with 1As and 1P by a&#8208;proton abstraction to give [U(TrenTIPS)(CHEPh3)] (TrenTIPS = N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3; E = As, 2As; P, 2P), where 2As is an unprecedented structurally characterised arsonium&#8208;carbene complex. The short U&#8208;C distances and obtuse U&#8208;C&#8208;E angles suggest significant U=C double bond character. A shorter U&#8208;C distance is found for 2As than 2P, consistent with increased uranium&#8208; and reduced pnictonium&#8208;stabilisation of the carbene as group 15 is descended, which is supported by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of CO2/N2 Selectivity in Porous Carbons from N2 Adsorption Isotherm at 77 K via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbons are an important class of porous materials with many applications including gas separation, while N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K is the most widely used approach to characterize porosity. Conventionally, textual properties such as surface area and pore volumes are derived from the N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K via fitting to an adsorption theory and then correlated to gas separation performance (uptake and selectivity). Here we use the N  2  isotherm at 77 K directly as input (representing feature descriptors for the porosity) to train convolutional neural networks that predict gas separation performance (using CO  2  /N  2  as a test case) for porous carbons more accurately. We then explore the porosity space for porous carbons for higher CO  2  /N  2  selectivity. We find that porous carbons with a bimodal pore&#8208;size distribution of well&#8208;separated mesopores (3 &#8211; 7 nm) and micropores (&lt; 2 nm) are most promising. This work will be useful in guiding experimental research of porous carbons with desired porosity for gas separation and other applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Twisted Surfaces in Mesoporous Single Crystals Deliver Enhanced Catalytic activity and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Porous single crystals which combine ordered lattice structures and disordered inter&#8208;connected pores would provide an alternative to create twisted surface in porous microstructures. Here we grow transition metal nitrides Nb4N5 and MoN single crystals at 2 cm scale to create well&#8208;defined active structures at twisted surfaces and we present high catalytic activity and stability toward non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Unsaturated metal&#8208;nitrogen coordination structures including Nb&#8208;N1/5, Nb&#8208;N2/5, Mo&#8208;N1/3 and Mo&#8208;N1/6 at twisted surface mainly account for the C&#8208;H activation with chemisorption of H in molecular ethane at twisted surface, which not only improves dehydrogenation performance but also avoids the deep cracking of ethane to enhance coking resistance. We demonstrate ~11&#8208;25% ethane conversion and ~98&#8208;99% ethylene selectivity without degradation being observed even after the operation of 50 hours.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantitative assessment of tip effects in single&#8208;molecule high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy using DNA origami substrates</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM) is widely employed in the investigation of dynamic biomolecular processes at a single&#8208;molecule level. However, it remains an open and somewhat controversial question, how these processes are affected by the rapidly scanned AFM tip.

Here, we quantitatively assess the role of tip effects in a strongly binding system using a DNA origami&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule assay. Despite its fM dissociation constant, we find that HS&#8208;AFM imaging can disrupt monodentate binding of streptavidin (SAv) to biotin (Bt) even under gentle scanning conditions. To a lesser extent, this is also observed for the much stronger bidentate SAv&#8208;Bt complex. This demonstrates the importance of a careful and quantitative evaluation of tip effects in the HS&#8208;AFM imaging also of strongly binding systems.

      <title>Optimization of Active Sites via Crystal Phase, Composition and Morphology for Efficient Low&#8208;Iridium Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Reducing the amount of iridium in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts without compromising their catalytic performances is one of the major requirements in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Here, with the help of theoretical studies, we show that anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions possess more active iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO  2  , the benchmark OER catalyst. It is worth adding that the same is not observed for their rutile&#8208;type counterparts. However, due to their thermodynamic metastablity, anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions are generally hard to synthesize. Our additional theoretical studies demonstrate that such catalytically active anatase&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution phases can be created  in situ  on the surfaces of readily available SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid solutions during electrocatalysis in acidic solution as the solution can etch away Sr atoms. We experimentally show this with porous SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid&#8208;solution nanotubes synthesized by a facile synthetic route that comprise 56% lower iridium than IrO  2  yet show an order of magnitude higher apparent catalytic activity for OER in acidic solution. Due to their crystal phase and chemical composition, the materials possess surface iridium sites with optimized oxygen&#8208;binding capability, thereby excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reducing the amount of iridium in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts without compromising their catalytic performances is one of the major requirements in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Here, with the help of theoretical studies, we show that anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions possess more active iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO  2  , the benchmark OER catalyst. It is worth adding that the same is not observed for their rutile&#8208;type counterparts. However, due to their thermodynamic metastablity, anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions are generally hard to synthesize. Our additional theoretical studies demonstrate that such catalytically active anatase&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution phases can be created  in situ  on the surfaces of readily available SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid solutions during electrocatalysis in acidic solution as the solution can etch away Sr atoms. We experimentally show this with porous SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid&#8208;solution nanotubes synthesized by a facile synthetic route that comprise 56% lower iridium than IrO  2  yet show an order of magnitude higher apparent catalytic activity for OER in acidic solution. Due to their crystal phase and chemical composition, the materials possess surface iridium sites with optimized oxygen&#8208;binding capability, thereby excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Polyphosphazene Hollow Nanosphere Derived N/P&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon with Single Nonprecious Metal Atoms for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped polymers or carbon nanospheres have attracted a broad research interest because of their fascinating properties. However, rational synthesis of these nanospheres with controllable uniform morphologies, small particle sizes, and well&#8208;designed functionalities is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an approach to construct cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene nanospheres with tunable hollow structures via a facile template&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. As comonomers, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene provides N and P atoms, tannic acid can coordinate with metal ions, and the replaceable third comonomer can endow the materials with various properties. After the carbonization, N/P&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres were obtained. In addition to the hollow structure, small particle size (~50 nm), and high surface area (411.60 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), atomic structural characterizations confirmed that the single atom transition metal sites (  i.e.  , Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  ) were uniformly dispersed in the carbon shell containing N and P dual coordination. The electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations revealed the superior oxygen reduction reaction performance of the obtained Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  active sites. This work provides a solution for fabricating diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing polymer nanospheres and their derived single metal atom doped carbon catalysts toward various applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using Covalent Triazine Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived organic molecules transforms solar energy to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density chemical bonds, and may enable the production of industrial building&#8208;block chemicals with great economical values.

Under the visible light illumination, our polymeric photocatalyst enables the transformation of maleic acid to succinic acid with an incredible production rate of ~2 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  , and furfural to furfuryl alcohol with a production rate of ~0.5 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  .

      <dc:description>Designing cost&#8208;effective and efficient electrocatalysts plays a pivotal role in advancing the development of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen generation. Herein, multifunctional active&#8208;center&#8208;transferable heterostructured electrocatalysts, platinum/lithium cobalt oxide (Pt/LiCoO2) composites with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) anchored on LiCoO2 nanosheets, are designed towards highly efficient water splitting.

Specifically, Pt species are the active centers and LiCoO2 acts as the co&#8208;catalyst for HER, whereas the active center transfers to LiCoO2 and Pt turns into the co&#8208;catalyst for OER. The unique architecture of Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructure provides abundant interfaces with favorable electronic structure and coordination environment towards optimal adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. The 30% Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers low overpotentials of 61 and 285 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. This study will diversify the design strategies for the development of efficient electrocatalysts via interface engineering towards water splitting and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy for Multiple Targets: A Highly Efficient AIE&#8208;Active Photosensitizer for Selective Bacterial Elimination and Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
      <dc:description>
Millennium bug: A simple and highly efficient photosensitizer, called 4TPA&#8208;BQ, operates by aggregation&#8208;induced emission. A broad&#8208;spectrum and potent antibacterial activity was attained after incubating 4TPA&#8208;BQ with pathogens for 15&#8197;minutes. Upon lengthening of the incubation time to 12&#8197;hours, photodynamic therapy with 4TPA&#8208;BQ targeted cancer cells and presented low toxicity to normal cells.







Abstract
Pathogen infections and cancer are two major human health problems. Herein, we report the synthesis of an organic salt photosensitizer (PS), called 4TPA&#8208;BQ, by a one&#8208;step reaction. 4TPA&#8208;BQ presents aggregation&#8208;induced emission features. Owing to the aggregation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species generated and a sufficiently small &#916;EST, 4TPA&#8208;BQ shows a satisfactorily high 1O2 generation efficiency of 97.8&#8201;%. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that 4TPA&#8208;BQ exhibited potent photodynamic antibacterial performance against ampicillin&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli with good biocompatibility in a short time (15&#8197;minutes). When the incubation duration persisted long enough (12&#8197;hours), cancer cells were ablated efficiently, leaving normal cells essentially unaffected. This is the first reported time&#8208;dependent fluorescence&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy in one individual PS, which achieves ordered and multiple targeting simply by varying the external conditions. 4TPA&#8208;BQ reveals new design principles for the implementation of efficient PSs in clinical applications.

      <title>New Wine in Old Bottles: Prolonging Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Crown Ethers by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Traditional crown ether is injected with fresh blood of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in crystalline state. Supramolecular interactions introduced by multiple oxygen atoms and K+ were explored as a general method to tune lifetime. This work opens a new world for crown ether and its intrinsic guest responsiveness offers a new avenue for versatile smart luminescent materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular macrocyclic hosts have long been used in smart materials. However, their triplet emission and regulation at crystal level is rarely studied. Herein, ultralong and universal room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is reported for traditional crown ethers. A supramolecular strategy involving chain length adjustment and morphological locking through complexation with K+ was explored as a general method to tune the phosphorescence lifetime in the solid state. A maximum 10&#8208;fold increase of lifetime after complex formation accompanied with by invisible to visible phosphorescence was achieved. A deep encryption based on this activated RTP strategy was also facilely fabricated. This work thus opens a new world for supramolecular macrocycles and their intrinsic guest responsiveness offers a new avenue for versatile smart luminescent materials.

      <title>Visualization and In&#8197;Situ Ablation of Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens through Metabolic Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Search and destroy: A bacteria&#8208;metabolizable probe, TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala, was designed to covalently label intracellular bacteria in living host cells. Additionally, the probe can effectively ablate the labeled bacteria in&#8197;situ owing to covalent ligation to peptidoglycan, yielding a minimum inhibitory concentration of 20&#177;0.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, which is lower than that of vancomycin.







Abstract
Protected by the host cells, the hidden intracellular bacteria are typically difficult to kill by common antibiotics and cannot be visualized without complex cellular pretreatments. Herein, we successfully developed a bacteria&#8208;metabolizable dual&#8208;functional probe TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala, which is based on d&#8208;alanine and a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission for fluorescence turn&#8208;on imaging of intracellular bacteria in living host cells and photodynamic ablation in&#8197;situ. Once metabolically incorporated into bacterial peptidoglycan, the intramolecular motions of TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala are inhibited, leading to an enhanced fluorescent signal, which allows the clear visualization of the intracellular bacteria. Moreover, TPEPy&#8208;d&#8208;Ala can effectively ablate the labeled intracellular bacteria in&#8197;situ owing to covalent ligation to peptidoglycan, yielding a low intracellular minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 20&#177;0.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, much more efficient than that of a commonly used antibiotic, vancomycin.

      <title>Optimized immobilization strategy for dirhodium (II) carboxylate catalysts for C&#8211;H functionalization and their implementation in a packed bed flow reactor</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate a sustainable, scalable packed bed flow reactor capable of achieving highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8211;H functionalization reactions using a newly developed Rh  2  (  S  &#8208;2&#8208;Cl&#8208;5&#8208;CF  3  TPCP)  4  catalyst. To optimize the immobilized dirhodium catalyst employed in the flow reactor, we systematically study both (i) the effects of ligand immobilization position, demonstrating the critical factor that the catalyst&#8208;support attachment location can have on the catalyst performance, and (ii) silica support mesopore length, demonstrating that decreasing diffusional limitations leads to increased accessibility of the active site and higher catalyst turnover frequency. We employ the immobilized dirhodium catalyst in a simple packed bed flow reactor achieving comparable yields and levels of enantioselectivity to the homogeneous catalyst employed in batch and maintain this performance over ten catalyst recycles.</dc:description>

      <title>Size and Halide Dependent Auger Recombination in Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) hold strong promise for a variety of light harvesting, emitting and detecting applications, all of which, however, could be complicated by multicarrier Auger recombination. Therefore, a complete documentation of the size and composition dependent Auger recombination rates of these NCs is highly desirable, as it can guide the system design in many applications. Here we report the synthesis and Auger measurements of monodisperse APbX  3  (A= Cs and FA; X = Cl, Br, and I) NCs in an extensive size range (~3&#8208;9 nm). The biexciton Auger lifetime of all the NCs scales linearly with the NC volume. The scaling coefficient is virtually independent of the cation but rather depends sensitively on the anion, which is 0.035, 0.085 and 0.142 ps per nm  3  for Cl, Br, and I, respectively. All of these are much faster than that in standard CdSe and PbSe NCs (~1 ps per nm  3  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Three&#8208;Photon Phosphorescence Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>Compared to two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) microscopy, three&#8208;photon excitation (3PE) microscopy has superior spatial resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and less defocused interference, and is, therefore, of great interest in the field of bioimaging. The design of suitable agents which can meet the various needs of the technology, such as large Stokes shift, good three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA), subcellular targeting, and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) properties, is a formidable challenge. In order to address this, two iridium(III) complexes (3PAIr1 and 3PAIr2) were developed as efficient three&#8208;photon phosphorescence (3PP) agents for bioimaging. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of a new group to the molecular scaffold confers a quadruple promotion in three&#8208;photon transition probability. Herein, the confocal and lifetime imaging of mitochondria as using Ir(III) complexes as 3PP agents is demonstrated for the first time. The complexes exhibit the advantages of low working concentration (50 nM), fast uptake (5 min), and low threshold for three&#8208;photon excitation power (ca. 0.5 mW at 980 nm). Moreover, the impressive tissue penetration depth achieved with these 3PA agents (ca. 450 &#181;m) allowed the 3D imaging and reconstruction of brain vasculature from a living specimen. These results indicate that the Ir(III) complexes are highly promising for medical imaging applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Stretchable perovskite solar cells with extremely recoverable performance</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising photovoltaic technology to sustainably drive stretchable applications, due to their flexible, light&#8208;weight and low&#8208;cost superiorities. However, fragility of crystals and poor crystallinity of perovskite on stretchable substrate afford an inevitable performance loss. In fact, the grain boundary defects are the Achilles&#8217; heel for the optoelectronic and mechanical degradations. Herein, we incorporate a self&#8208;healing polyurethane (s&#8208;PU) with dynamic oxime&#8722;carbamate bonds as a scaffold into the perovskite films, which simultaneously enhances crystallinity and passivates grain boundary of the perovskite films. The stretchable PSCs with s&#8208;PU deliver a stabilized efficiency of 19.15% with negligible hysteresis, which are comparable to the performance on rigid substrates. The PSCs can maintain over 90% of the initial efficiency after 3000 h under air environment because of their self&#8208;encapsulating structure. More importantly, the self&#8208;healing function of s&#8208;PU scaffold is in&#8208;situ verified. The s&#8208;PU can release the mechanical stress and repair the crack at grain boundary on multiple levels. The devices recover 88% of their original efficiency after 1000 cycles at 20% stretch. This ingenious growth strategy of crystalline semiconductors will enable a new approach for development for flexible and stretchable electronics.</dc:description>

Benefitting from their improved electronic property and increased molecular weight, both polymers exhibited excellent unipolar n&#8208;type character in transistors with electron mobility up to 2.60 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. When applied as acceptor materials in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, PBTI and P(BTI&#8208;BTI2) achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.67% and 8.61%, respectively. The PCE (6.67%) of polymer PBTI, synthesized from the novel distannylated monomer, is substantially higher than that (0.14%) of the same polymer PBTI*, synthesized from typical dibrominated monomer. The 8.61% PCE of copolymer P(BTI&#8208;BTI2) is also substantially higher than those (&lt; 1%) of homopolymers synthesized from dibrominated monomers.&#160;The results demonstrate the great success of BTI&#8208;Tin for facilely accessing structurally novel n&#8208;type polymers with greatly improved device performance.</dc:description>

      <title>The Impact of Aggregation on the Photophysics of Spiro&#8208;bridged Heterotriangulenes</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the impact of the central heteroatom on structural, electronic, and spectroscopic properties in a series of heterotriangulenes including a spirofluorene&#8208;bridged triphenylamine, &#8208;phosphine, and &#8208;phosphine oxide and provide a detailed study on their aggregates.

This analysis was particularly helpful to deconvolute the complex fluorescence spectra with contributions from the peripheral fluorenes and the respective heteroaromatic cores. Going beyond the molecular scale, we examined the aggregation behavior of these heterotriangulenes in THF/H  2  O mixtures and analyzed the amount as well as the size of the aggregates by static and dynamic light scattering. The excited&#8208;state interactions within the aggregates at high water contents were found to be similar to those found in the solid state.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;III Absorbing and Emitting Dyes: Energy Gap Engineering of Expanded Porphyrinoids via Metallation</title>
      <dc:description>The rational synthesis of organometallic complexes of modified 26 &#960; &#8208;conjugated hexaphyrins with third near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;III) absorption and emission capabilities is described. Symmetry alteration of the frontier molecular orbitals of bis&#8208;Pd(II) and bis&#8208;Pt(II) complexes of hexaphyrin via N&#8208;confusion modification led to substantial metal d  &#960;  &#8211;p  &#960;  interactions. This MO mixing, in turn, resulted in a significantly narrower HOMO &#8211; LUMO energy gap. A remarkable long&#8208;wavelength shift of the lowest S  0  &#8208;&gt; S  1  absorption beyond 1700 nm was achieved with the bis&#8208;Pt(II) complex,  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  . The emergence of photoacoustic (PA) signals maximized at 1700 nm makes  t  &#8208;Pt  2  &#8208;3  &#160; potentially useful as a NIR&#8208;III PA contrast agent. The rigid bis&#8208;Pd(II) complexes,  t  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  and  c  &#8208;Pd  2  &#8208;3  , are rare examples of NIR emitters beyond 1500 nm.

The current study provides new insight into the design of stable, expanded porphyrinic dyes possessing NIR&#8208;III emissive and photoacoustic response capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>&lt;p&gt;Four&#8208;Component Borocarbonylation of Vinylarenes Enabled by Cooperative Cu/Pd Catalysis: Access to &amp;beta;&#8208;Boryl Ketones &amp;amp; &amp;beta;&#8208;Boryl Vinyl Esters&lt;/p&gt;</title>
      <dc:description>We report here a general four&#8208;component synthetic procedure for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;boryl ketones and &#946;&#8208;boryl vinyl esters. Joined catalyzed by palladium and copper catalysts, borocarbonylative reaction between vinylarenes, aryl halides/triflates, B  2  Pin  2  and carbon monoxide proceed successfully. A variety of synthetically useful &#946;&#8208;boryl ketones were synthesized in good to high yields by using aryl iodides as the substrates. It is noteworthy that, when applying aryl triflates as the starting materials, &#946;&#8208;boryl vinyl esters were synthesized with broad functional groups tolerance from a similar manner, and a rational mechanism was also proposed.</dc:description>
